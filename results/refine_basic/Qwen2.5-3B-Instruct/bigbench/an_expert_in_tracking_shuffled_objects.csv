"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From Clue 1, we know the flutist lives in house number 2.

From Clue 4, the pianist must live in either house number 3 or house number 4. If the pianist were in house number 3, the guitarist would have to be in house number 2, which contradicts the condition that the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips must be adjacent and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips. Therefore, the pianist must live in house number 4.

This leaves house number 3 for the person with the carnations arrangement and house number 1 for the person with the bouquet of lilies. The person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 2 (since house number 2 is occupied by the flutist and house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist).

Thus, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **House 1:** The person who is eating kiwis.
2. **House 2:** The person who likes green.
3. **House 3:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy (they live next to each other).

From Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3.

From Clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house, so the percussionist must live in house 1.

From Clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, which is consistent with Clue 5.

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives. Since the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy are in houses 2 and 3, the cellist must live in house 1.

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1, and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

From Clue 2, the person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover. Since the person who only drinks water is in house 1, the person who has a television must be in house 1, which contradicts the person who only drinks water being in house 1. Therefore, the person who has a television must be in house 2, and the root beer lover must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who is eating grapes must be in house 2.

From Clue 7, the percussionist does not live in the second house, so the percussionist must live in house 1.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- **House 1:** Green (person who likes green)
- **House 2:** Blue (person who likes blue), Gameboy (person who has a gameboy), Root beer (person who drinks root beer)
- **House 3:** Kiwis (person who eats kiwis)

Therefore, the cellist must live in house 2.

The number of the house where the cellist lives is **(B) 2**."

"Given the clues and the logical deductions, the tea drinker lives in house number 4. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**(C) 4**"
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From Clue 6, we know the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 3. From Clue 7, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors, and from Clue 4, the person who only drinks water lives in house 5. This means the person who only drinks water is in house 5, and the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in houses 1 and 2.

Since the person who only drinks water is in house 5, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in houses 1 and 2. Given that the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors, they must be in houses 1 and 2. This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with Clue 4.

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in the first house, so the person who had pizza must live in either house 2 or house 4. Since the person who only drinks water is in house 5, the person who had pizza must be in house 4.

From Clue 5, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 2.

This leaves house 1 for the root beer lover, as it is the only house left for the root beer lover to be directly left of the person who had stew.

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5.

The answer is (A) 5."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

From these constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Violinist (ate spaghetti)
- House 3: History book buff (ate fried rice)
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2.
- The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone must be in adjacent houses (House 2 and House 3 or House 1 and House 2).

Since the history book buff is in House 3, the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone must be in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 3. Given that the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist, and the violinist is in House 1, the bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1, making the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone in House 2 and House 3.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. This means the person driving a truck must live in house 1 because the person driving a truck is the only other car type left.

From Clue 1, since the person driving a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff, and the history book buff cannot be in house 1 (because the person driving a truck is in house 1), the history book buff must be in house 2. Therefore, the person driving a convertible must be in house 1.

Since the person driving a convertible is in house 1, they are not wearing boots. Thus, the person wearing boots must be in house 2. This leaves the person in house 1 as the mystery book reader.

Therefore, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff lives in House 4 and the mystery book reader lives in House 3.

4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Mystery book reader
   - House 2: Romance book lover

5. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

6. The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

With the remaining houses and roles:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left for the basketball player is House 2.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
The correct option is (B) 3.
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the person who likes yellow. Since they cannot be in house 2, they must be in either house 1 or house 3.

### Case 1: The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a gameboy must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who likes green).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

### Case 2: The person who likes yellow is in house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
2. The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
3. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
5. The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
6. The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.
7. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
8. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the third house. This leaves the first and fourth houses for the tea drinker and the romance book lover and history book buff.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the first and fourth houses. Given that the tea drinker cannot be in the second house, the tea drinker must be in the first house, and the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the first and fourth houses, respectively.

This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the green drinker lives in the second house (Clue 7), the yellow drinker must live in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker lives in the third house, the coffee drinker must live in the first house.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.
2. The fish enthusiast lives in house 2.
3. The person who had pizza lives in house 2.
4. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio, which means the person who likes green lives in house 2 and the person who has a radio lives in house 1.

From these deductions:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who is a cat lover must be in house 1 (as the fish enthusiast is in house 2), the number of the house where the cat lover lives is 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"The person who only drinks water lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fifth house.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

From Clue 6 and Clue 4, we know that grilled cheese and pizza must be in houses 1 and 2. From Clue 8, grilled cheese and tulips must be in houses 1 and 2. From Clue 7, grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 2. From Clue 4, grilled cheese and stew must be in houses 1 and 2. Therefore, grilled cheese must be in house 1, pizza in house 2, and stew in house 4.

From Clue 2, oranges and apples must be in houses 1 and 2. Since grilled cheese is in house 1, oranges must be in house 2 and apples in house 3.

From Clue 9, oranges and kiwis must be in houses 1 and 3. Since oranges are in house 2, kiwis must be in house 3.

From Clue 10, oranges and carnations must be in houses 1 and 2. Since oranges are in house 2, carnations must be in house 1.

From Clue 11, apples and mangos must be in houses 1 and 2. Since apples are in house 3, mangos must be in house 4.

From Clue 3, tulips must be in house 5.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled cheese, Carnations
- House 2: Pizza, Oranges
- House 3: Apples, Spaghetti
- House 4: Stew, Mangos
- House 5: Tulips

The person who had stew lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues and logical deductions, the fish enthusiast lives in house 5. However, since the provided options do not include 5, and based on the options given (A) 2, (B) 3, (C) 1, (D) 4, the closest logical fit from the options provided would be house 4, as it is the furthest right option and the only one that aligns with the placement of the other pets and characteristics.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their house numbers step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 has a phone.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 does not wear boots.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person with horses lives in house 1 and the person with a radio lives in house 2, or vice versa.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Has a phone.

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Does not wear boots.

From Clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots and has a phone.

Since the person in house 1 has a phone (Clue 1), the person in house 2 must be wearing boots (since the person in house 2 does not wear boots). Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

Now, let's determine the pets and devices:
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots and has a phone.

Since the person in house 1 cannot have a phone (because the person in house 1 has a phone), the person in house 1 must own horses. The person in house 2 must have a radio.

So, the characteristics are:
- House 1: Owns horses, wears high heels, has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots, has a phone.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The cat lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives.
8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 11, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house (House 1).

From Clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese (House 1) lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. Therefore, the fish enthusiast must live in House 2.

From Clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese (House 1) lives directly left of the person who had fried rice. Therefore, the person who had fried rice must live in House 3.

From Clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house (House 3). This means the cat lover is the person who had fried rice.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. Since the cat lover (House 3) is the person who had fried rice, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must be in Houses 2 and 4 or 4 and 5.

From Clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the fish enthusiast (House 2) is the person who had fried rice, the person who had stew must be in House 5 and the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 4.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in House 4, the bird keeper must be in House 3, but we already know the cat lover is in House 3. This means the bird keeper must be in House 1, and the person who had pizza must be in House 2.

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a phone is in House 2, the person who owns horses must be in House 1, and the person who has a gameboy must be in House 5.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who has a phone
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Cat lover (Person who had fried rice)
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 5: Person who has a gameboy

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

The correct answer is (A) 1."

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house number 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"The basketball player lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues and deductions, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 5.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The tea drinker lives in house 4.
2. The saxophonist lives in house 2.
3. The pizza eater lives in house 3 (since they are to the right of the saxophonist).
4. The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
5. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
6. The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker, so the cellist must be in house 3 and the person who ate fried rice must be in house 4.
7. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
8. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1 (since the pizza eater is in house 3).
10. The person who had stew lives in house 2 (since the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1).

From the above, we can conclude that the cellist lives in house 3. 

Therefore, the number of the house where the cellist lives is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
6. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the minivan driver lives in house 4. From Clue 10, the root beer lover lives in house 3. 

From Clue 8, the basketball player lives directly left of the truck driver, so the truck driver must be in house 2 and the basketball player in house 1.

From Clue 3, the swimmer lives directly left of the sedan owner. Since the swimmer is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the truck driver. This means the swimmer must be in house 2, and the sedan owner must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in house 1, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 3 or 4. But house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner. Therefore, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 4.

From Clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other. Since the bouquet of lilies is in house 4, the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player live one house apart. The only remaining houses are 1 and 2. Since the swimmer is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the tennis player must be in house 3.

From Clue 4, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the truck driver is in house 2 and the carnations arrangement owner must be in house 1, this is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to reassess the positions.

Revisiting the positions:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Truck driver
- House 3: Sedan owner
- House 4: Root beer lover

Since the sedan owner must be in house 3 and the bouquet of lilies is in house 4, the sedan owner must be in house 3. The truck driver must be in house 2. The bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3, and the bouquet of lilies must be in house 4.

Thus, the truck driver must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(A) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house (Clue 1).
2. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person driving a minivan (Clue 2).
3. The person driving a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 3).
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives (Clue 4).
5. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house (Clue 5).

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 1, the person eating apples must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person eating oranges cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1 or 3.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3.

Given Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2, they must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the person eating oranges, the person driving a minivan, and the person driving a convertible.

Since the person driving a convertible must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 3), and the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3. This leaves house 2 for the person driving a minivan and the science fiction book fanatic.

Thus, the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person with a rose bouquet lives in house 2.
   - This means house 2: Rose Bouquet.

2. **Clue 1**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - This means if the television is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 2.
   - If the television is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
   - This means the tea drinker must live in either house 1 or house 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means if the television is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
   - If the television is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 3.

5. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - This means if the flutist lives in house 1, the person eating a banana must live in house 3.
   - If the flutist lives in house 2, the person eating a banana must live in house 1.
   - If the flutist lives in house 3, the person eating a banana must live in house 2.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means if the person with a vase of tulips is in house 3, the person with a radio must be in house 1.
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2, the person with a radio must be in house 1.
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in house 1, the person with a radio must be in house 1.

7. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker must be in a house with a lower number than the person eating kiwis.

8. **Clue 4 (reiteration)**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means if the television is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2.
   - If the television is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 3.

9. **Clue 3 (reiteration)**: The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
   - This means the tea drinker must live in either house 1 or house 3.

From clue 7, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives in house 2.

From clue 1, if the television is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 2, which contradicts clue 7. Therefore, the television must be in house 2, and the guitarist must be in house 3.

From clue 5, if the flutist lives in house 1, the person eating a banana must live in house 3. This fits with the arrangement.

From clue 6, if the person with a vase of tulips lives in house 3, the person with a radio must be in house 1. This fits with the arrangement.

From clue 2, the person eating kiwis must live in house 3, and the coffee drinker must be in house 1.

From clue 4, the person with a television (in house 2) is directly left of the guitarist (in house 3).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Coffee drinker, radio, and person eating bananas.
- House 2: Rose bouquet, television, and guitarist.
- House 3: Person eating kiwis, person with a vase of tulips, and person with a radio.

The root beer lover must live in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the root beer lover lives is **(C) 1**."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast, so they must be in the fourth house.
3. The person eating apples does not live in the third house, and there is one house between the person eating apples and the person wearing boots. This means the person eating apples must be in the first house, and the person wearing boots must be in the fifth house.
4. The person eating mangos lives directly left of the person wearing sandals, and the person eating a banana lives directly left of the person wearing sandals. This means the person wearing sandals must be in the second house, the person eating mangos in the first house, and the person eating a banana in the fourth house.
5. The person eating a banana lives in the fourth house, and the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."

2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house (number 2).
3. The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.

From these clues, we deduced:

- The person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (number 1).
- The flutist lives in the first house (number 1).
- The person who likes white lives in the second house (number 2).
- The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house (number 1).

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the second house (number 2).

The number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is **2**."
"The violinist lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. House 3: Not boots, not yellow, not stew.
2. House 2: High heels.
3. House 4: Blue, loafers, not white.
4. House 5: Grilled cheese, not red, not stew.
5. House 6: Not white, not red, not stew.

From the clues, the person who likes blue lives in house 4, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 5 (since the loafers must be to the right of the cat lover, and the cat lover must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is already occupied by high heels).

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

The correct answer is (E) 5."

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 1, the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house, so they must live in the second house (house 2).

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic (SFF) lives somewhere to the left of the golfer (Golfer).
   - This means SFF is in House 1 and Golfer is in House 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) live directly next to each other.
   - Since SFF is in House 1, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist (G) lives somewhere to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils (D).
   - Since Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

Combining Clues 1 and 2:
- SFF (House 1)
- PE and HBB (House 1 and House 2)
- Golfer (House 2)

Combining Clue 3:
- G (House 2)
- D (House 1)

Given these constraints, the only feasible arrangement is:
- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (Golfer), G (golfer), PE (pizza-eater), HBB (history book buff)

Therefore, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1.

"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.
2. The basketball player does not live in house 1, so the basketball player must live in house 2.
3. The person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must be in house 1, and the violinist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"The cricketer lives in the 2nd house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's summarize the characteristics of each person and their corresponding houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house (house 2).
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:
- **House 1:** Person who only drinks water, Person who likes white, Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2).
- **House 2:** Person who only drinks water (lives in house 1), Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2), Person who likes red, Person who plays baseball (lives in house 1), Person who wears loafers (lives in house 2).

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is **(A) 2**."
"To determine the house where the root beer lover lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

- Since the root beer lover cannot be in house 2 (Clue 3), they must be in either house 1 or house 3.
- The person who only drinks water must be in house 1 or house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person eating oranges cannot be in house 2 (Clue 4), so they must be in either house 1 or house 3.
- The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (Clue 1 and Clue 4).

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2.
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration does not work because the person eating oranges cannot be in house 1 twice.

- If the root beer lover is in house 3:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2.
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their characteristics:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Now, we know:
- House 1: Spaghetti eater
- House 2: Boots wearer
- House 3: Fried rice eater

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"Given the clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The tennis player does not live in the first house.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:
- The person who likes mystery books lives in house 1.
- The person who likes fantasy books must live in house 2 because the tennis player lives in house 2 and the tennis player plays tennis.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is 2.

From the clues, we know the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who likes white cannot be in the first house (house 1). The person who likes white must be in one of the last three houses (houses 2, 3, or 4).

Since the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in the fourth house (house 4), the person who likes white must be in the fourth house (house 4).

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house.

"Based on the given clues, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The person eating grapes does not live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person driving a convertible lives in the second house.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we deduce that the person eating grapes must live in the second house, and since the baseball player also lives in the second house, the person driving a convertible must also live in the second house.

Since the person eating grapes lives in the second house, the person eating mangos must live in the first house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is (B) 1."
"Based on the clues provided:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
2. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
3. The person who likes blue is in house 2, so the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.
4. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
5. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.

From these clues, we deduce:

- House 1: The person who likes green (since the person who likes blue is in house 2 and the person who likes white must be in house 3).
- House 2: The person who likes blue.
- House 3: The person who likes white.

Since the person who is eating kiwis is in house 1 and the person who is eating oranges must be in house 3 (as the person who is eating apples is in house 1 and the person who is eating oranges must be directly right of the person who is eating apples), the person who is eating oranges must be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. **Clue 1** states that the root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
2. **Clue 2** indicates that the soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader. This means the soccer player and the mystery book reader must be in adjacent houses, with the soccer player in house 1 and the mystery book reader in house 2, or vice versa.
3. **Clue 3** specifies that the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader. This means the person with the gameboy must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person with the gameboy is in house 1.
- The mystery book reader is in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player is in house 1 (since the mystery book reader is in house 2).

From Clue 1, we know:
- The root beer lover must be in house 2 (since the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the root beer lover is to the right of the person with the rose bouquet).

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them. Let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the people as Cat Lover, Fish Enthusiast, Horse Owner, and Dog Owner.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**From Clue 4:**
- The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
- This means the fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 2:**
- There are two houses between the truck and the dog owner.
- This means the truck and the dog owner cannot be in the first or last house. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

**From Clue 3:**
- The truck lives directly left of the sedan.
- This means the truck and the sedan must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 1:**
- The minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
- This means the minivan cannot be in the first house.

**From Clue 5:**
- The cat lover does not live in the second house.
- This means the cat lover must live in either the first or the fourth house.

### Combining Clues:

Let's test the possible positions for the dog owner and the truck:

1. **Dog owner in house 3:**
   - Truck must be in house 2 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 4 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 2 and the dog owner is in house 3).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration works:
   - House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
   - House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
   - House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
   - House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

2. **Dog owner in house 4:**
   - Truck must be in house 3 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 2 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 3 and the dog owner is in house 4).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 5).

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:
- House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
- House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
- House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - This means the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

2. **Clue 4**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water.

3. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3.

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- The third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.
- The second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer.
- The person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3.
- The person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3.
- The person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water.

Given these constraints, let's place the people in the houses:
- House 1: Only drinks water (let's call this person ""W"")
- House 2: Likes root beer (let's call this person ""R"")
- House 3: Likes yellow (let's call this person ""Y"")
- House 4: Likes blue (let's call this person ""B"")

Since the person who likes blue (B) must be in a house number greater than 3, and the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3, the only possible house for the person who likes blue is House 4.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives in house 2.

6. **Clue 5**: The person wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
7. **Clue 7**: The person wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

Let's start with Clue 6:
- House 2: Person who likes blue.

Next, Clue 1:
- The cricketer must be in house 3 (since house 2 is taken by the person who likes blue).

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer

Next, Clue 5:
- The person wearing sandals must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer).

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals

Now, Clue 4:
- The dog owner must be in house 1 (since house 1 is taken by the unknown person and house 3 is taken by the cricketer and the person wearing sandals).

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals

Next, Clue 2:
- The baseball player must be in house 1 (since house 1 is taken by the dog owner).

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Dog owner, Baseball player
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals

Now, Clue 3:
- The person eating grapes must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer, person wearing sandals, and person eating grapes).

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Dog owner, Baseball player
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals, Person eating grapes

Finally, Clue 7:
- The person wearing loafers must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer, person wearing sandals, and person eating grapes).

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Dog owner, Baseball player
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals, Person eating grapes, Person wearing loafers

The person who likes white (the only color left) must be the bird keeper, and since the bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (as house 1 is taken by the dog owner and baseball player), the bird keeper must be in house 3.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."

The number of the house where the history book buff lives is **3**.
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the cellist and the person with the gameboy are neighbors, and the cellist is to the left of the person with the gameboy.

2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   - This means the dog owner must live in the second house.

Considering the possible positions for the cellist and the person with the gameboy:

- If the cellist is in house 1, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 2.
- If the cellist is in house 2, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 1.

However, the dog owner cannot be in house 1, so the only possible arrangement is:
- Cellist in house 1
- Gameboy owner in house 2

This leaves house 1 for the dog owner.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **1**."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. House 1: Minivan
2. House 3: Gameboy
3. House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be adjacent to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, and considering the occupied houses:

- House 1 is occupied by the minivan.
- House 3 is occupied by the gameboy.
- House 4 is occupied by the radio.

The only house left for the person with the phone is House 2. Therefore, the person with the phone must be in House 2, and the person with the SUV must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"The dog owner lives in House 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3."
The number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is **1**.

12. The person who likes white lives in the third house (Clue 12).
13. The fish enthusiast lives in the first house (Clue 13).

From Clue 12, the person who likes white lives in the third house. From Clue 11, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. Since there is one house between the person who likes red and the person who owns an SUV, the person who likes red must live in the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is (C) 2."
"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 1. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their attributes:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the root beer lover lives in a house with a higher number than the person who is wearing sandals.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes lives in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2, 3, or 4.

Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1 (Clue 7), and the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 4), the only options left for the person who ate grilled cheese are houses 2, 3, or 4. Given that the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese, the only feasible option is house 4 for the person who ate grilled cheese.

Now, we have:
- House 4: Person who ate grilled cheese

This leaves houses 1, 2, and 3 for the remaining people:
- House 1: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)
- House 2: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 4), the only option left for the person who only drinks water is house 4, which is already occupied.

This leaves houses 1 and 2 for the person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who had stew must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), and the person who is wearing running shoes must be to the left of the person who had stew (Clue 5), the only feasible option is house 2 for the person who had stew and house 1 for the person who is wearing running shoes.

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

11. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
12. **Clue 13**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

From Clue 11, Clue 12, and Clue 5, we know:
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- First house: root beer lover (since the root beer lover does not live in the first house and the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio, the root beer lover must be in the first house)
- Second house: tea drinker (since the tea drinker must be somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk, and the root beer lover is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the second house)
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk (since the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in the fifth house)
- Sixth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Sixth house: person who had stew (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the sixth house)
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Seventh house: person who had stew
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, and the third house is occupied by the cricketer, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the eighth house)
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers
- Ninth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Ninth house: person who had stew
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the tenth house)
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese
- Eleventh house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives in the ninth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the eleventh house)
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From the above analysis, the person with the computer lives directly next to the person with the gameboy. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with the radio lives in the third house, and the person with the loafers lives in the third house, the person with the gameboy must be in the second house, and the person with the computer must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the first house.

- The pianist lives in house 1.
- The root beer lover lives in house 2.
- The person who owns horses lives in house 1 (since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who owns horses and the root beer lover is in house 2).

Since the person who owns horses is in house 1, they are the dog owner. The person who likes white cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

3. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fried rice eater and fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

5. **Clue 1**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

6. **Clue 3**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

7. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

Given the constraints:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater
- The guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.
- The guitarist and violinist must be in houses 1 and 3.

This leaves:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist

This leaves the remaining houses for the fried rice eater and fantasy book enthusiast:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

The only remaining positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."

3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

2. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

3. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)

- Romance book lover in House 2
- History book buff in House 3

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in House 1, so they must live in either House 2 or House 3. Since the romance book lover is in House 2, the person who had pizza must be in House 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes green must be to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in House 3, the person who likes green must be in House 2. This is consistent with the arrangement we have.

"The person who is eating oranges lives in house number 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"The person who is eating apples lives in house 2.

(A) 2"
"The person who had pizza lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know:
- The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
- The mystery book reader also lives in the fourth house, which contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, we need to reassess the positions.

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the mystery book reader must be in the fifth house. This means the saxophonist and the violinist must be in the third and fifth houses, respectively, or the third and fourth houses, respectively. However, since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Now, let's place the other characteristics:
- The saxophonist is in the fourth house.
- The mystery book reader is in the fifth house.
- The violinist is in the third house.
- The romance book lover is in the second house (since the saxophonist is in the fourth house and the romance book lover must be to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast).
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house, but since the mystery book reader is already in the fifth house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

Thus, the correct positions are:
- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Romance book lover
- **House 3:** Violinist
- **House 4:** Saxophonist
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with the television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person wearing loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person with the phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person with the radio lives and where the person wearing sandals lives.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 4: Television

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Loafers

From Clue 3, we know:
- House 3: Phone (since the phone cannot be in house 2)

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Boots (since the boots must be to the left of the loafers)

From Clue 5, we know:
- The radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since house 2 is already occupied by loafers, the radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3.

Let's test the possible placements:
- If the radio is in house 1, then the sandals must be in house 3.
- If the radio is in house 3, then the sandals must be in house 1.

Testing Scenario 1: Radio in house 1, Sandals in house 3
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 1: Radio
- House 3: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which contradicts Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

Testing Scenario 2: Radio in house 3, Sandals in house 1
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 3: Radio
- House 1: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which is consistent with Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

Therefore, the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"The person who is wearing high heels lives in house number 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Since the person wearing loafers does not live in the first house (Clue 1), they must live in the second house.
- The mystery book reader cannot live in the second house (Clue 2), so they must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who had pizza lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person eating mangos lives in house 1.
2. The saxophonist lives in house 2.
3. The rose bouquet is in house 1 or house 2, and since the saxophonist lives in house 2, the rose bouquet must be in house 1.
4. The lilies are in house 2.

Since the person eating apples cannot be in house 1 (as the mangos are there) and cannot be in house 2 (as the saxophonist is there), the only remaining house for the person eating apples is house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Clue 15**: The person who has a radio lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house (House 4).
3. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in House 4, the person with a television must be in House 5.
4. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given Clue 15, the person with a radio is in House 1, and the person with a computer cannot be in House 3 (Clue 9), so the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in Houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since the coffee drinker is in House 4, the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in Houses 2 and 3.
5. **Clue 14**: The basketball player lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the basketball player and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given the possible placements, the only valid pair is (2, 3).
6. **Clue 13**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. This means the person who drives a minivan and the root beer lover must be in adjacent houses. Given Clue 12, the person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other, so the person who drives a minivan must be in House 2 and the basketball player in House 3. The root beer lover must be in House 4.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. This confirms the placements of House 2 and House 3.
8. **Clue 11**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who owns an SUV must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Given Clue 10, the person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who likes red must be in House 2, and the golfer must be in House 3.
9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. This confirms the placements of House 2 and House 3.
10. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer must be in House 2 and the person who only drinks water must be in House 3.
11. **Clue 8**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes milk must be in House 5, and the person who likes yellow must be in House 4.
12. **Clue 6**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. This means the person who likes yellow must be in House 4, and the cricketer must be in House 5.
13. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. This means the person who owns a sedan must be in House 1, and the swimmer must be in House 2.
14. **Clue 9**: The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. This means the person who has a computer must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Given Clue 10, the person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who likes red must be in House 2, and the golfer must be in House 3.
15. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. This means the coffee drinker must be in House 4, and the person who has a television must be in House 5.

From the above deductions, the coffee drinker lives in House 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is **4**.

The correct answer is (E) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their respective characteristics:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. This means the tulip person can only live in houses 1 or 2.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. This means the rose bouquet person can only be in house 1 or 3.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:
  - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of the person who likes milk.

1. **House 4: Lilies**
2. **House 5: Tulips**
3. **House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
4. **House 2: Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
5. **House 1: Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Not Lilies, Not Tulips**

Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house (House 5), the person who likes milk must live in House 4 (Lilies) or House 2. However, the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist, which means the pianist cannot be in House 1 or House 2.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- **House 1:**
  - Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic
  - Not Lilies
  - Not Tulips
  - Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic
  - Not Carnations
  - Not Piano
  - Not Violinist (since Violinist lives somewhere to the right of Science Fiction Book Fanatic)

- **House 2:**
  - Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic
  - Not Lilies
  - Not Tulips
  - Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic
  - Not Carnations
  - Not Piano
  - Not Violinist

- **House 3:**
  - Science Fiction Book Fanatic
  - Not Lilies
  - Not Tulips
  - Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic
  - Not Carnations
  - Not Piano
  - Not Violinist

- **House 4:**
  - Lilies
  - Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic
  - Not Lilies
  - Not Tulips
  - Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic
  - Not Carnations
  - Not Piano
  - Not Violinist

- **House 5:**
  - Tulips
  - Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic
  - Not Lilies
  - Not Tulips
  - Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic
  - Not Carnations
  - Not Piano
  - Not Violinist

From the above, the person who likes milk must be in House 4 (Lilies) because House 2 cannot be the house of the person who likes milk due to the constraints of the other clues.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in **House 4**.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. **First house**: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
2. **Fourth house**: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Third house**: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
4. **Second house**: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Given the constraints, the only possible positions for the swimmer and the cricketer are:
- Cricketer in the first house (yellow), and swimmer in the third house (blue).
- Cricketer in the third house (blue), and swimmer in the first house (yellow).

Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the cricketer must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house.

Now, the second house must be occupied by the person who likes white and the person who is eating oranges. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (yellow), and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the first house (yellow). Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.

This leaves the person who owns an SUV in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The answer is (D) 2."
"The person who likes blue lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (number 1), but this is contradictory since only one person can live in each house. Therefore, we must consider the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist in different houses.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1). Since the fantasy book enthusiast likes green, the person who likes red must live in the second house (number 2). This satisfies clue 3 because the person who likes green (living in house 2) is to the left of the person who likes red (living in house 2).

Thus, the person who likes red lives in the second house (number 2), and the person who likes green lives in the first house (number 1).

Since the cellist lives in the first house (number 1), the cellist must be the person who likes green. This leaves the pianist to be the person who likes red and lives in the second house (number 2).

Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in the first house (number 1).

The number of the house where the mystery book reader lives is **1**."
"Given the constraints and the process of elimination, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses. We'll start by placing the people based on the most restrictive clues and then fill in the rest.

1. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer.
2. **Clue 13:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
4. **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
5. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
6. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the golfer and the person eating grapes:
- Since the golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza, and the person eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer, we can place the golfer in house 1 and the person eating grapes in house 2.

Next, place the history book buff and the person who ate fried rice:
- The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice, so we can place the history book buff in house 2 and the person who ate fried rice in house 3.

Now, place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing boots:
- The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots, and the person who is wearing boots must be in house 1 or 2. Since the golfer is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 3.

Next, place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who ate grilled cheese:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

Finally, place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who is eating apples:
- The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating apples must be in house 5. The science fiction book fanatic must be in house 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 2: Person eating grilled cheese (wearing high heels)
- House 3: Person eating oranges (wearing boots)
- House 4: Person eating pizza (wearing high heels)
- House 5: Person eating apples (science fiction book fanatic)

Therefore, the swimmer must live in house 4.

The answer is: (D) 4"
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses as follows:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

From Clue 3, the history book buff lives in the first house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

From Clue 1, there is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives. This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in the first or third house because there would be no house between them and the swimmer. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Now, the swimmer must live in the first or third house. But since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the swimmer must live in the first house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Thus, the swimmer lives in the first house.

The number of the house where the swimmer lives is **(A) 1**."
"Based on the given clues and the deductions made, the person who had stew lives in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"To determine the house where the person who ate fried rice lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals, then Person 2 (House 2) must own horses.
   - If Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals, then Person 1 (House 1) must own horses.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti, then Person 2 (House 2) must be the history book buff.
   - If Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti, then Person 1 (House 1) must be the history book buff.

Given these constraints, let's consider the possible scenarios:

- **Scenario 1:** Person 1 (House 1) owns horses and is wearing sandals.
  - Person 2 (House 2) is the history book buff.
  - Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti.
  - Person 2 (House 2) is the cat lover.
  - Person 1 (House 1) is the romance book lover.
  - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing running shoes.

- **Scenario 2:** Person 2 (House 2) owns horses and is wearing sandals.
  - Person 1 (House 1) is the history book buff.
  - Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti.
  - Person 1 (House 1) is the cat lover.
  - Person 2 (House 2) is the romance book lover.
  - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing running shoes.

In both scenarios, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2, as the history book buff (Scenario 1) or the person who ate spaghetti (Scenario 2) must be to the right of the person who ate fried rice.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is **2**."
"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).
4. **Tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the tennis player is in house \(i+1\) or later.
5. **There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet**: This means if the rose bouquet is in house \(i\), the daffodils are in house \(i+1\) or \(i-1\).
6. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\).

### Analyzing the Clues:
- **Clue 6**: Mystery book reader in house 1 (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- **Clue 4**: Fantasy book enthusiast in house 2 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer).
- **Clue 1**: There is one house between the mystery book reader and the swimmer.
- **Clue 7**: Tennis player does not live in house 4.
- **Clue 8**: There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet.
- **Clue 9**: There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover.

### Placing the People:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player.
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

### Final Placement:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player.
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast.

### Conclusion:
The romance book lover must be in house 2, as there are two houses between the mystery book reader (house 1) and the romance book lover.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Coffee drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Coffee drinker.

2. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the computer and gameboy cannot be in House 3. So, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

3. **The saxophonist does not live in the second house.**

7. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.**
   - Computer in House 5, so cellist must be in House 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the computer is in House 5, the percussionist must be in House 4 (but cellist is in House 4). So, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3 and the percussionist in House 5.

9. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
   - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

13. **The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

14. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
    - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The history book buff lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. **Clue 12**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
4. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. **Clue 9**: The flutist does not live in the first house.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
11. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who likes green lives.
12. **Clue 11**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the history book buff in the second house:
1. History book buff (2)

Next, we need to place the person who had pizza and the person who ate fried rice. According to Clue 10 and Clue 12, the person who had pizza must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the percussionist must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Also, there is one house between the history book buff and the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 14). This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house, and the person who had pizza must be in the first house:
1. Pizza (1)
2. History book buff (2)
3. Spaghetti (3)
4. ?

Now, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice (Clue 8). The person who likes blue must be to the left of the percussionist (Clue 6) and to the left of the person who had pizza (Clue 7). The person who likes white must be to the left of the person who likes yellow (Clue 5). The person who likes green must be two houses to the right of the person who likes blue (Clue 2). The fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fourth house (Clue 11).

Let's place the person who likes green in the fourth house (fantasy book enthusiast):
1. Pizza (1)
2. History book buff (2)
3. Spaghetti (3)
4. Green (fantasy book enthusiast)

Now, the person who likes blue must be to the left of the percussionist and to the left of the person who had pizza. The person who likes blue must be in the first house, and the person who had pizza must be in the second house. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

Let's place the person who likes blue in the first house and the person who had pizza in the second house:
1. Blue (1)
2. Pizza (2)
3. Spaghetti (3)
4. Green (fantasy book enthusiast)

Now, the person who likes yellow must be to the left of the person who likes white (Clue 5). The person who likes white must be to the left of the person who likes yellow. The person who likes green must be in the fourth house (fantasy book enthusiast). The person who likes green must be two houses to the right of the person who likes blue. The person who likes green must be in the fourth house (fantasy book enthusiast).

So, the arrangement is:
1. Blue (1)
2. Pizza (2)
3. Spaghetti (3)
4. Green (fantasy book enthusiast)

The cellist must be in the third house, which is house number 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the cellist lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's reanalyze the positions of the people and the fruits:

1. **Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

**Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

**Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.

**Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
- If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
- If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).
- There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (Clue 4).

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating kiwis lives in house 1. 

From clue 1, since the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in house 1, they must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the third house.
3. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
4. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
6. The person who has a computer does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first house.
7. The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
8. The person who has a computer does not live in the second house, so they must live in the first house.
9. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
10. The person who likes green does not live in the second house.

From these deductions, we can confirm that the person who likes red lives in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is 3.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the root beer lover cannot be in the second house (house 2), they must be in the first house (house 1).
- The pianist and the cellist must be in the remaining houses, and they must be adjacent to each other with the pianist to the left of the cellist.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"The person who has the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4."
"The pianist lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the second house (Clue 7).
3. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house (Clue 3).
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house (Clue 4).
5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels (Clue 5).
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew (Clue 6).
7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house (Clue 7).

From Clue 2, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. From Clue 4, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or third house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house (since the person who had stew cannot live in the second house).

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. The second house is occupied by someone who likes green. The third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or second house. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other (Clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The coffee drinker (CD) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW).
2. The science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in the first house (house 1).

From these clues, we can deduce:

- The SF lives in house 1.
- The CD cannot be in house 1, so the CD must be in house 2.
- The SW cannot be in house 1, so the SW must be in house 1.
- This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to the remaining houses.

Since the SF is in house 1, the CD must be in house 2. This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to house 1. Since the CD is already in house 2, the water drinker must be in house 1, leaving the romance book lover to be in house 2.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

- The percussionist lives in House 1.
- The person with the radio lives in House 2.
- The pianist lives in House 2 (since the percussionist is in House 1 and they must be different).
- The person with the phone lives in House 1 (since the person with the radio is in House 2 and they must be different).

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

(A) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know the second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 2, the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them. This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3.

From clue 3, the person who likes yellow must be in the house directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan. Given the positions of the other two people, the only way this can be satisfied is if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, and the person who likes yellow is in house 2.

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"The person who owns horses lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5."

From this, we can deduce that the person with the carnations arrangement (C) must be in house 1, and the dog owner (D) must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the individuals:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.
   - If the person drinking water is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.

   - If the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person liking yellow must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is **2**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2 (the right house).

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (the left house).

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - Since the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 1 (because the tea drinker cannot be in house 2).

From these deductions:
- The person wearing sandals is in house 1.
- The person eating grapes is in house 1 (since they live next to the person wearing sandals).
- The tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (since they live to the right of the person wearing sandals and cannot be in house 1).

Therefore, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2.

3. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives (Clue 2).
4. The violinist does not live in the third house (Clue 4).

From Clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Tea drinker

From Clue 4, the violinist cannot be in house 3. Therefore, the violinist must be in either house 2 or house 3.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist. This means:
- If the violinist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 3.
- If the violinist is in house 3, the guitarist must be in house 2, but this contradicts Clue 2.

Thus, the violinist must be in house 2, and the guitarist must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3, which aligns with our deduction.

Therefore, the number of the house where the guitarist lives is 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who only drinks water, which means the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water.

3. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who ate spaghetti is in house \(i\), the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house \(i-1\).

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
   - This means if the gameboy is in house \(j\), the fried rice must be in house \(j+1\) or \(j-1\).

5. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - The television and phone must be in houses with the television to the left of the phone.

6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
   - This means if the grilled cheese is in house \(k\), the radio must be in house \(k+1\) or \(k-1\).

Let's start by placing the computer and radio:
- Since the radio cannot be in house 4, it must be in house 1, 2, or 3.
- If the radio is in house 1, the grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since there is one house between them).
- If the radio is in house 2, the grilled cheese must be in house 1.
- If the radio is in house 3, the grilled cheese must be in house 2.

Let's try placing the computer in house 1:
- House 1: Computer
- House 4: Pizza
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 5: Spaghetti

Now, we need to place the gameboy and fried rice:
- The gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house.
- If the gameboy is in house 2, the fried rice must be in house 3 (but house 3 is occupied by grilled cheese).
- If the gameboy is in house 3, the fried rice must be in house 4 (but house 4 is occupied by pizza).
- If the gameboy is in house 4, the fried rice must be in house 5 (but house 5 is occupied by spaghetti).
- If the gameboy is in house 5, the fried rice must be in house 4 (but house 4 is occupied by pizza).

Thus, the only feasible placement is:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Spaghetti

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 5.

The answer is (D) 5."
"Given the clues and logical deductions, we can determine the house where the person who is eating a banana lives as follows:

1. **Pianist in Third House**: The pianist lives in the third house.
2. **Percussionist in Fourth House**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Tennis Player in First House**: The tennis player lives in the first house.
4. **Bird Keeper in Second House**: The bird keeper lives in the second house.
5. **Saxophonist and Grilled Cheese**: The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other.
6. **Saxophonist and Golfer**: There is one house between where the saxophonist lives and where the golfer lives.
7. **Basketball Player and Cat Lover**: The basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover.
8. **Mangos and Horse**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
9. **Pianist and Horse**: The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
10. **Apples and Oranges**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
11. **Stew and Banana**: The person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
12. **Saxophonist and Grilled Cheese**: The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other.
13. **Tennis Player and Baseball Player**: The tennis player and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
14. **Basketball Player and Cat Lover**: The basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover.
15. **Mangos and Horse**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
16. **Tennis Player in First House**: The tennis player lives in the first house.
17. **Percussionist in Fourth House**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
18. **Pianist Not in Third House**: The pianist does not live in the third house (already deduced).
19. **Piano Not in Fifth House**: The pianist does not live in the fifth house (already deduced).
20. **Piano Not in Fourth House**: The pianist does not live in the fourth house (already deduced).
21. **Piano Not in Third House**: The pianist does not live in the third house (already deduced).
22. **Piano Not in Second House**: The pianist does not live in the second house (already deduced).
23. **Piano Not in First House**: The pianist does not live in the first house (already deduced).

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the pianist must live in the third house, the percussionist in the fourth house, the tennis player in the first house, and the bird keeper in the second house. The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other, and the saxophonist and the golfer live one house apart. The basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover, and the person who is eating a banana lives directly next to the person who had stew.

Given that the tennis player lives in the first house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the second or third house. Since the pianist lives in the third house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the second house.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is **2**.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house, so the percussionist must be in house 1.

From this, we know:
- The percussionist lives in house 1.
- The grilled cheese eater lives in house 2.
- The bird keeper lives in house 1 (but since the grilled cheese eater is already in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2).

This leaves the guitarist and the pizza eater to be placed in the remaining houses (houses 1 and 2). Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2, the guitarist and the pizza eater must be in the remaining houses.

Since the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2 (because the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the pizza eater cannot be in house 2).

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in house number 3.

(A) 3"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3**: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4**: The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. **Clue 6**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. **Clue 8**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 9 and Clue 10, we can infer that the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses, respectively, or the third and first houses, respectively. Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in the second house (Clue 3), the flutist must be in the second house.

- **House 2**: Flutist
- **House 1 or 3**: Fantasy book enthusiast
- **House 3**: Fish enthusiast (since the fish enthusiast must be to the right of the person eating a banana, and the flutist is in the second house)

Now, let's consider the remaining clues:

- **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
- **Clue 7**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.

Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person eating a banana must be in the first house. This leaves the person eating oranges to be in the second house, and the pianist to be in the first house.

- **House 1**: Person eating a banana
- **House 2**: Flutist
- **House 3**: Fish enthusiast

Now, the person eating oranges must be in the second house, and the pianist must be in the first house. This leaves the cat lover to be in the first house, which contradicts Clue 10 (the cat lover lives in the first house). Therefore, the cat lover must be in the third house.

- **House 1**: Pianist
- **House 2**: Flutist
- **House 3**: Cat lover

This leaves the person eating oranges to be in the second house, and the fish enthusiast to be in the third house. The person wearing running shoes must be in the first house, and the person wearing loafers must be in the third house.

- **House 1**: Person wearing running shoes
- **House 2**: Flutist
- **House 3**: Person wearing loafers

Finally, the person eating oranges must be in the second house, and the person wearing loafers must be in the third house. The person who is eating apples must be in the first house, and the person who is eating bananas must be in the second house.

- **House 1**: Person eating apples
- **House 2**: Person eating oranges
- **House 3**: Person wearing loafers

The person who is eating bananas must be in the first house, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in the third house. The person who is wearing high heels must be in the second house.

- **House 1**: Person eating bananas

"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

2. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana must be in houses 1 and 3, or houses 2 and 4. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

3. **Clue 4**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes green must be in a house to the left of the person who likes yellow. Given the arrangement so far, the person who likes green must be in house 1 or house 2. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who likes white, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This contradicts Clue 6, which states that the person who is eating grapes is in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: Yellow

4. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who likes red lives in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, this is consistent with Clue 2. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3 and the person who is eating kiwis must be in a house to the right of house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4. So, the arrangement is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Kiwis

Thus, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. The correct answer is (A) 4."
"The person who had stew lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means if the daffodils are in house \(X\), the phone must be in house \(X+1\).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes root beer lives in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who has a television lives in either house 1 or house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means if the person with the television is in house \(X\), the person with the vase of tulips must be in house \(X-1\).

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in house 1. From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2. From Clue 4, the person who has a television cannot live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or house 3. From Clue 5, if the person with the television lives in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 (which contradicts Clue 2). Therefore, the person with the television must live in house 3.

This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the person who likes root beer.

### Conclusion

The person who likes root beer lives in house 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Wearing loafers

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - Phone: House 1, 2
   - Mangos: House 2, 3

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - Grapes: House 1, 2
   - Water: House 2, 3

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - Boots: House 1, 2

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - Kiwis: House 1, 2
   - Milk: House 2, 3

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Boots: House 1, 2
   - Gameboy: House 1, 2, 3

7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - Kiwis: House 2, 3

### Deductions

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers (Clue 1)
- **House 2:** Phone, Boots, Gameboy (Clue 2, Clue 6)
- **House 3:** Mangos, Milk, Kiwis (Clue 2, Clue 5)

Since the person with the phone is in House 2, the person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy, so the person with the phone is the one who has a computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.
3. **Clue 3:** The golfer and the baseball player live directly next to each other.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
7. **Clue 7:** The cricketer does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the golfer and the baseball player next to each other. Since the golfer cannot be in house 3, the possible pairs are:
- Golfer in house 1, Baseball player in house 2

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their characteristics:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating oranges.

2. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Owning horses.

3. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in houses 2 and 3. Given that house 3 is occupied by the person owning horses, the person eating mangos must be in house 2 and the person driving a convertible must be in house 3. However, this contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, the person eating mangos must be in house 3, and the person driving a convertible must be in house 2.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Since the person driving a convertible is in house 2, the person driving a truck must be in house 1.

5. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - Given the remaining houses (1 and 3), and knowing the person eating oranges is in house 1 and the person driving a truck is in house 1, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 3 and the dog owner must be in house 2.

6. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - This is already satisfied as the person eating mangos is in house 3.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Driving a truck.
- House 2: Eating mangos.
- House 3: Owning horses.

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"The correct option is (B) 4.

To elaborate on the reasoning without referencing the previous response:

1. **Clue 1 and Clue 2**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader must be somewhere to the left of the percussionist, and the percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

2. **Clue 3**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the percussionist.

3. **Clue 4**: There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. This means the saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, and the person who had pizza must be in the second or fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader.

5. **Clue 6**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. This means the flutist must be in a house to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

6. **Clue 7**: The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the guitarist and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist.

7. **Clue 8**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese eater must be in adjacent houses, and the grilled cheese eater must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

8. **Clue 9**: There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the history book buff must be in the house directly to the right or left of the mystery book reader.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the first, second, fourth, or fifth houses.

By analyzing these clues, we can deduce the following:
- The saxophonist must be in the second house.
- The mystery book reader must be in the first house.
- The guitarist must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist, so the guitarist must be in the first house.
- The percussionist must be in the fourth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, but this is already occupied by the mystery book reader, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.
- The romance book lover must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist, so the romance book lover must be in the third house.
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house, but this is already occupied by the mystery book reader, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house.
- The flutist must be in the third house.
- The history book buff must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist, so the history book buff must be in the third house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fifth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the percussionist lives in the fourth house."
"The person who is eating mangos lives in the fifth house (House 5). Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. House 3: Green
2. House 3: Radio
3. House 3: Computer (since the computer must be to the left of the phone, and the computer cannot be in house 2)
4. House 3: Phone
5. House 3: Gameboy
6. House 3: Television (since the television lives directly left of the person who likes red, and the television is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2)
7. House 2: Red
8. House 2: Percussionist (since the percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white, and the percussionist is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 3)
9. House 3: White
10. House 1: Saxophonist (since the saxophonist must be in the remaining house, which is house 1)
11. House 1: Guitarist (since the guitarist lives directly next to the percussionist, and the percussionist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1)
12. House 4: Cellist (since the cellist does not live in house 5, and the cellist cannot be in house 1, the cellist must be in house 4)
13. House 4: Television (since the television lives directly left of the person who likes red, and the television is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2)
14. House 5: Violinist (since the violinist lives two houses away from the percussionist, and the percussionist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 5)

Therefore, the saxophonist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist must be in house 1 and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - Given the positions of the cellist and the mystery book reader, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this scenario is not possible.

2. **Clue 2**: The dog owner does not live in the second house.
   - This means the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 3 if the dog owner lives in house 1.
   - The person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 if the dog owner lives in house 3.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

- If the dog owner is in house 1:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1).
  - The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 1.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 (Clue 3).

- If the dog owner is in house 3:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The bird keeper must be in house 1 or house 2.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 3.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 (Clue 3).

From the above analysis, the only consistent scenario is when the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them. Let's summarize the placements based on the clues:

1. **House 4: Swimmer**
2. **House 3: Banana**
3. **House 2: Computer**
4. **House 1: Basketball Player**

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 2 (Computer):** The person who has a phone.
- **House 3 (Banana):** The person who is eating a banana.
- **House 4 (Swimmer):** The person who has a gameboy.

- **Banana (House 3):** The person who is eating oranges.
- **Gameboy (House 4):** The person who is wearing high heels.
- **Rose bouquet (House 3):** The person who is wearing loafers.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the bird keeper step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not horses.

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, and vice versa.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not banana.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not horses.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the person eating a banana is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 2. This leaves house 3 and house 4 for the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis.

Since the person eating mangos is in house 1, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. From Clue 5, the person who owns horses cannot be in house 2, so the person who owns horses must be in house 4.

This leaves house 3 for the bird keeper and house 2 for the person eating kiwis.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Mystery book reader

2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the bird keeper must be in adjacent houses, and since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the only possible adjacent houses are houses 2 and 3.

3. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the bird keeper must live in the third house (since the romance book lover cannot live in the third house, and the bird keeper must be in an adjacent house).

4. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
   - Since the bird keeper lives in the third house, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(B) 2**."

- From Clue 4, the person eating mangos is in house 4.
- From Clue 6, the person eating kiwis cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2 or 4. Since the mangos eater is in house 4, the kiwis eater must be in house 1 or 2.
- From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be to the left of the person drinking water. This means the apple eater and water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the mangos eater is in house 4, the apple eater and water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2.
- From Clue 5, the apple eater must be to the left of the tea drinker. Therefore, the apple eater must be in house 1 and the water drinker in house 2.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person eating apples
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Person drinking water
- House 4: Person eating mangos

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"The person who is eating a banana lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"The correct option is (C) 1.

To elaborate on the reasoning without referencing the previous response:

1. **Clue 6** indicates the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the minivan cannot be in the leftmost house (house 1) because there is no one to the left of the flutist.
2. **Clue 5** states the minivan is to the right of the truck. This means the truck cannot be in house 3.
3. **Clue 2** states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. Since the truck cannot be in house 3, the gameboy must be in house 1 (leftmost house) and the truck in house 2.
4. **Clue 3** states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 3.
5. **Clue 4** states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with the television must be in house 2 (left of the cellist) and the person with high heels must be in house 1 (right of the cellist).
6. **Clue 7** states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 3 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their belongings:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house (house 5).
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (house 2).
3. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist, so the pianist must be in house 3.
4. **Clue 13**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils (house 2) lives directly left of the person who has a television (house 3).
5. **Clue 8**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
6. **Clue 7**: The person who has a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
8. **Clue 3**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
9. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
10. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 12**: The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the SUV lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the root beer lover).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan driver cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the minivan driver).

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.
- The truck driver is to the right of the root beer lover.
- The minivan driver is not in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

(A) 3"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
3. The flutist lives in the third house.
4. The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other, so the cellist must live in the second house.
5. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house (Clue 15).
6. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other (Clue 5).

12. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house (Clue 4).
13. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist (Clue 14).

From Clue 11, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first or third house. Since the third house is occupied by the flutist, the sedan owner must be in the first house.

From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first or second house. Since the second house is occupied by the cellist, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.

From Clue 10, the person who likes green does not live in the third house, and since the third house is occupied by the flutist, the person who likes green must be in the first or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the person who likes green must be in the first house.

From Clue 12, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house, and the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 13, the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the sedan owner is in the first house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the second house, and the person who likes red must be in the third house.

From Clue 5, the person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. Since the person who had pizza is in the fourth house, the person who had stew must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house, so the person who drives a convertible must be in the second or fourth house. Since the second house is occupied by the flutist, the person who drives a convertible must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the first house and the tennis player must be in the fourth house, this clue is consistent.

From Clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house, which is consistent with the sedan owner being in the first house.

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in House 1, and the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3.

   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - This is already satisfied with the arrangement above.

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red

- The person who has a television must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who has a phone must be in House 1.

4. The baseball player and the person eating grapes live next to each other, and since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1.
5. The tea drinker and the person eating grapes live next to each other, and since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 1.

Thus, the assignments are:
- House 1: Tea drinker, Baseball player

The person who has a rose bouquet must be to the right of the person who owns a sedan, and the person who has a rose bouquet cannot be in the second house (Clue 14).

Given the constraints, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the third house, and the person who owns a sedan must be in the second house. The person who has a rose bouquet (third house) must be to the right of the person who owns a sedan (second house).

The person who ate fried rice must be to the right of the cat lover (Clue 9). The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be to the right of the soccer player (Clue 7).

From the remaining houses (second, third, and fourth), the person who ate fried rice must be in the third or fourth house. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the fourth house.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding houses step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - If Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
   - If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

2. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.

3. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - If Person 1 (House 1) wears boots, then Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.
   - If Person 2 (House 2) wears boots, then Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader.

From Clue 3, if Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck. This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow because it would contradict Clue 1 (Person 1 eats grapes).

Therefore, Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow. This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.
- Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.

From Clue 2, since Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, Person 2 (House 2) wears boots. This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Thus, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 2**.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a computer lives is **5**."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person wearing boots lives in the second house.
2. The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
4. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person wearing boots.
5. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From Clue 1 and Clue 4:
- House 1: Cat Lover
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Sedan

From Clue 2:
- The person wearing high heels must be in House 1 (since the cat lover is already in House 1) and the dog owner must be in House 3 (since the person wearing high heels is directly left of the dog owner).

Thus, the person wearing high heels is the cat lover, and the dog owner is in House 3.

From Clue 3:
- House 3: Sedan

From Clue 4:
- The person who owns an SUV must be in House 1 (since the person wearing boots is in House 2 and the person wearing high heels is in House 1).

So, the person who owns an SUV is the cat lover, which contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must be the person wearing running shoes.

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Based on the clues provided:

4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
8. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Person who likes green
- House 2: Tulips, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other, and the only remaining house for the person who likes milk is House 3, the person who is eating apples must be in House 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the people and their devices as follows:

1. The mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the history book buff (HBB).
2. The mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P).
4. The mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV).

From Clue 2, we know the mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as Mystery Reader (MR), History Book Buff (HBB), and Science Fiction Fanatic (SFF).

From Clue 1, the mystery book reader (MR) must be in the first house, and the history book buff (HBB) must be in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: ?
- House 3: ?

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the person who has a computer (C). So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: ?

From Clue 3, the person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P). Since the person with the computer is in the second house, the person with the phone must be in the first house. This means the person with the phone is the mystery book reader (MR). This is consistent with Clue 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB (history book buff)

The person who has a phone is the mystery book reader (MR), and the person who has a computer is in the second house. The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic (SFF), who must be in the third house.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

"To address the question of whether a bull shark bite hurts worse than a crocodile bite, we need to consider the nature and potential severity of the injuries from each. Both bull sharks and crocodiles are capable of delivering powerful bites, but the pain and severity of the injury can vary based on several factors.

Bull sharks are known for their aggressive behavior and are often found in coastal and river environments. Their bites can be quite severe due to their powerful jaws and the potential for causing significant tissue damage, infection, and other complications. The pain from a bull shark bite is generally intense and can be quite debilitating.

Crocodiles, while also capable of delivering powerful bites, are generally more selective about their prey and are less likely to attack humans unless provoked or threatened. The severity of the bite can vary depending on the species and the size of the crocodile. However, crocodile bites can still cause significant pain and injury.

Given these factors, it is difficult to definitively say that one bite is necessarily worse than the other. Both can be serious and painful. Therefore, the answer to whether a bull shark bite hurts worse than a crocodile bite is:

(B) No"

"To determine if a 500GB USB device is enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to consider the storage requirements for a single hour of Netflix content.

1. **Netflix Content Size**: Netflix typically streams content at a resolution of 1080p, which is a high-quality format. The size of a 1080p video file can vary, but generally, a single hour of high-quality video can range from 1.5GB to 3GB.

2. **Storage Requirement for 10 Hours**: If we take the average size of a 1080p video file as 2.5GB (which is a reasonable estimate), then 10 hours of video would require:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times 2.5 \text{ GB/hour} = 25 \text{ GB}
   \]

3. **Comparison with USB Capacity**: A 500GB USB device has a storage capacity of 500GB.

"To determine if you could watch all of ""JAG"" in six months, we need to consider the total number of episodes and the average time it would take to watch them.

""JAG"" consists of 191 episodes. If you watch one episode per day, it would take you 191 days to watch all of them. 

Converting 191 days into months, we use the average of 30.44 days per month:

\[ \frac{191 \text{ days}}{30.44 \text{ days/month}} \approx 6.27 \text{ months} \]

Since 6.27 months is slightly more than 6 months, the answer is:
