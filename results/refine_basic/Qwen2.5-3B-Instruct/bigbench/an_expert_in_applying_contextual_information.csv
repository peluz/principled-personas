"Given the clues and the logical deductions, the tea drinker lives in house number 4. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**(C) 4**"
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. The violinist lives in House 1.
2. The history book buff lives in House 3.
3. The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 1.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.
5. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
6. The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone live directly next to each other.
7. The person who has a radio lives in either House 2 or House 3.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the percussionist.

From these, we can infer:
- House 1: Violinist (ate spaghetti)
- House 3: History book buff (ate fried rice)
- House 2: Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone (next to each other)

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist, and the violinist is in House 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1, which contradicts the violinist being there. Therefore, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 2, and the percussionist must be in House 3.

Thus, the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone must be in House 2.

The person with a vase of tulips lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. From Clue 1, the person driving a convertible must live in house 1 because the convertible driver is directly left of the history book buff. Therefore, the person driving a truck must live in house 2.

This leaves the person in house 1 to be the mystery book reader and the person in house 2 to be the history book buff. Since the person wearing boots lives in house 2, the person wearing boots must be the history book buff, and the person wearing sandals must be in house 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
The correct option is (B) 3.
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the person who likes yellow:
- Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2, they must be in either house 1 or house 3.

### Case 1: The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a gameboy must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who likes green).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

### Case 2: The person who likes yellow is in house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

4. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
5. The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.

7. The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
9. The person who likes white lives in the first house.

From these deductions:
- The third house is occupied by the root beer lover.
- The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
- The tea drinker is not in the second house.
- The person who likes red lives in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.
- The person who likes green lives in the second house.
- The person who likes white lives in the first house.

This leaves the coffee drinker for the fourth house.

From these deductions:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who is a cat lover must be in house 1 (as the fish enthusiast is in house 2), the number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

Since the cat lover lives in house number 3, the fish enthusiast must live in house number 4 (one house to the right of the cat lover).

From Clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the fried rice person lives in house number 3, the stew person must live in house number 2.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the stew person lives in house number 2, the bird keeper must live in house number 1 (but house 1 is already occupied by the grilled cheese person).

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the bird keeper lives in house number 1, the person who has a television must live in house number 3 (one house to the right of the bird keeper).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a television lives in house number 3, the person who has a gameboy must live in house number 4 (one house to the right of the television person).

From Clue 9, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the stew person lives in house number 2 and the spaghetti person lives in house number 5, this is consistent.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. Since the grilled cheese person lives in house number 1 and the fried rice person lives in house number 3, the phone and pizza person must live in houses 2 and 3 respectively.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Grilled Cheese
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Television
- House 5: Stew

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Pianist does not live in the first house.**
2. **Person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.**
3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other, and the person eating kiwis to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist next to each other, and the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio next to each other.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, we need to place the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist next to each other, and the person eating oranges directly left of the person with a television.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Given the constraints, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The answer is (A) 8."
"Given the clues and the logical deductions, we can determine the house where the person who owns a sedan lives. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
   - This seems contradictory since the milk drinker and the apple eater cannot both live in the same house. Let's re-evaluate the setup.
3. **Re-evaluating Clue 2**: The person who is eating apples cannot live in the third house if the milk drinker is there. Let's assume the milk drinker is not in the third house.
4. **Clue 3**: The person who likes red does not live in the third house.
5. **Clue 4**: The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
6. **Clue 5**: The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 6**: There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10**: The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
11. **Clue 11**: The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
12. **Clue 12**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.
13. **Clue 13**: The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Given the setup, let's place the milk drinker in a different house. Let's assume the milk drinker is in the second house.

- **House 2**: Milk drinker
- **House 3**: Apple eater (since the apple eater cannot be in the third house if the milk drinker is there)

Now, the milk drinker is in the second house, and the apple eater is in the third house. Let's place the person who likes red in the first house (since it's to the left of the person who only drinks water).

- **House 1**: Red drinker
- **House 2**: Milk drinker
- **House 3**: Apple eater

Next, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house (since they live directly left of the person who likes yellow).

- **House 4**: Only drinks water
- **House 3**: Apple eater

The person who likes red must be to the left of the person who only drinks water, so the person who only drinks water is in the fourth house, and the person who likes red is in the first house.

- **House 1**: Red drinker
- **House 4**: Only drinks water

The person who likes red (in the first house) must be to the left of the person who only drinks water (in the fourth house). The person who drives a convertible must be to the left of the person who likes red, so the person who drives a convertible is in the second house.

- **House 2**: Convertible driver
- **House 1**: Red drinker

The person who likes blue must be directly left of the person who drives a truck, so the person who likes blue is in the third house, and the person who drives a truck is in the fourth house.

- **House 3**: Blue drinker
- **House 4**: Only drinks water

The person who is eating mangos must be directly left of the person who likes green, so the person who is eating mangos is in the second house, and the person who likes green is in the third house.

- **House 2**: Mangos eater
- **House 3**: Blue drinker

The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. The person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house, and the person who owns a sedan must be in the fifth house.

- **House 4**: Only drinks water
- **House 5**: Sedan owner

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the fifth house.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Based on the clues provided:

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From Clue 5, we know the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. 

From Clue 4, the person eating a banana does not live in the second house, so the person eating a banana must live in the third house.

From Clue 3, the person who drives a truck does not live in the first house, and from Clue 1, the person who drives a truck does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

This leaves the first house for the person who owns an SUV.

Thus, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 2, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the second house, as they live directly left of the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 3, the swimmer lives in the first house.

From clue 4, the cricketer does not live in the third house, which is consistent with the previous information.

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

1. **House 5: Blue (Person who likes blue)**

2. **House 4: White (Person who likes white)**

3. **House 1: SUV (Person who owns an SUV)** (since it cannot be in the first house)

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The tea drinker lives in house 4.
2. The saxophonist lives in house 2.
3. The pizza eater lives in house 3 (since they are to the right of the saxophonist).
4. The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
5. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
6. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
7. The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker, so the cellist must be in house 3.
8. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. The flutist does not live in the fourth house.
10. The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.

From clue 8, the pizza eater is in house 3. From clue 4, the cellist must be in house 3. From clue 6, the person who only drinks water and the person who is wearing loafers must be in adjacent houses. From clue 1, the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk. From clue 7, the cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice, so the person who ate fried rice must be in house 4.

Given that the tea drinker is in house 4, the pizza eater is in house 3, and the cellist is in house 3, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water and the person who is wearing loafers is house 1 and house 2. Since the person who is wearing sandals must be to the left of the person who likes milk, and the person who is wearing sandals is in house 1, the person who likes milk must be in house 2.

Thus, the cellist lives in house 3.

The number of the house where the cellist lives is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
6. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the minivan driver lives in house 4. From Clue 10, the root beer lover lives in house 3. 

From Clue 8, the basketball player lives directly left of the truck driver, so the truck driver must be in house 2 and the basketball player in house 1.

From Clue 3, the swimmer lives directly left of the sedan owner. Since the swimmer is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the truck driver. This means the sedan owner must be in house 3, and the swimmer in house 1.

From Clue 2, the bouquet of daffodils and the bouquet of lilies live next to each other. Since the root beer lover is in house 3 and the sedan owner is in house 3, the bouquet of daffodils and the bouquet of lilies must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the sedan owner is in house 3, the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2, and the bouquet of lilies in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3) lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (house 1). This is consistent.

From Clue 6, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the tennis player is in house 2 and the tea drinker must be in house 4, this is consistent.

From Clue 4, the person who drives a truck (house 2) lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the person who drives a truck is in house 2, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(D) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house (Clue 1).
2. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person driving a minivan (Clue 2).
3. The person driving a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 3).
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives (Clue 4).
5. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house (Clue 5).

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 1, the person eating apples must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person eating oranges cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1 or 3.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3.

Given Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2, they must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the person eating oranges, the person driving a minivan, and the person driving a convertible.

Since the person driving a convertible must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 3), and the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3. This leaves house 2 for the person driving a minivan and the science fiction book fanatic.

Thus, the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

The number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 3."
"The root beer lover lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast, so they must be in the fourth house.
3. The person eating apples does not live in the third house, and there is one house between the person eating apples and the person wearing boots. This means the person eating apples must be in the first or fourth house, and the person wearing boots must be in the second or fifth house.
4. The person eating mangos lives directly left of the person wearing sandals, and the person eating apples lives directly left of the person wearing sandals. This means the person eating mangos must be in the first house, and the person wearing sandals must be in the second house.
5. The person eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast, so they must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the person eating a banana must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person eating mangos
- Second house: Person wearing sandals
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic
- Fifth house: Person eating a banana

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"The person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house (number 2). Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The violinist lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"The person who has a computer lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic (SFF) lives somewhere to the left of the golfer (Golfer).
   - This means SFF is in House 1 and Golfer is in House 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) live directly next to each other.
   - This means PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses. Since Golfer is in House 2, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist (G) lives somewhere to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils (D).
   - This means G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D. Since Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

Given these constraints, let's fit the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 2 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"

"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house (House 1).

From Clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Lilies

From Clue 4, the basketball player cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the basketball player must live in House 2.

Now, let's consider Clue 1 and Clue 2:
- **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
- **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.

Since the basketball player (who is not eating apples) lives in House 2, the person eating apples must be in House 1. This means the person eating apples is in House 1.

Given that the person eating apples is in House 1, the person with the radio must be in House 2 (since the radio holder is to the right of the person eating apples). Therefore, the person with the radio is the basketball player.

This leaves the violinist to be the person in House 1, as the violinist must be to the right of the person eating apples (House 1) and the radio holder (House 2).

Thus, the violinist lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the violinist lives is **1**."
"The cricketer lives in the 2nd house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the clues provided:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.

From these clues, we deduce:

- The person who likes white lives in house 1.
- The person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
- The baseball player lives in house 1 (since they are next to the person who ate spaghetti).
- The person who only drinks water lives in house 1 (since they are next to the person who ate spaghetti).

Since the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in house 1, they must live in house 2. Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers must live in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is **(A) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of the root beer lover:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 3).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 2).

This configuration does not work because the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2.

- If the root beer lover is in house 3:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their characteristics:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Now, we know:
- House 1: Spaghetti eater
- House 2: Boots wearer
- House 3: Fried rice eater

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating kiwis
   - House 2: Eating apples

2. The bird keeper and the person wearing high heels live next to each other.
   - Since the person eating kiwis (House 1) is not the dog owner, the bird keeper must be in House 1 and the person wearing high heels must be in House 2.

5. The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not dog owner

Since the tennis player and the person eating apples (dog owner) live next to each other in House 1, and the tennis player must be in House 1, the person eating apples (dog owner) must be in House 2.

Therefore, the cricketer must live in House 2.

The number of the house where the cricketer lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."

2. The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).

From Clue 1, we know that the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is (B) 1."
The number of the house where the dog owner lives is **1**.
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

3. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fried rice eater and fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

5. **Clue 1**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

6. **Clue 3**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

7. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

Given the constraints:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater
- The guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.
- The guitarist and violinist must be in houses 1 and 3.

This leaves:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, the remaining positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"The person who owns horses lives in House 3.

(C) 3"
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses as follows:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"The person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

(A) 3"
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who only drinks water lives in house 1.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.
3. The person who likes milk lives in house 3.
4. The person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 3.
5. This leaves house 1 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"The cricketer lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

3. **Clue 3:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in House 1.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and since the romance book lover is to the left of the history book buff, the only possible arrangement for these two is:
- Romance book lover in House 2
- History book buff in House 3

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in House 1, so the person who had pizza must live in either House 2 or House 3. Since the romance book lover is in House 2, the person who had pizza must be in House 3.

From Clue 5, the person who ate fried rice must live somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in House 2, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 3.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know:
- The fourth house is occupied by the mystery book reader.
- The fourth house is also occupied by the saxophonist.

Since the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other, the violinist must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the history book buff and the guitarist. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house and the percussionist is in the third house, the history book buff must be in the second house, and the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 3, there is one house between the percussionist and the mystery book reader. Since the percussionist is in the third house and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, this clue is satisfied.

- House 2: The saxophonist (saxophonist)
- The rose bouquet is in house 1 or house 2.
- The lilies are in house 1 or house 2.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. This means the tulip person can only live in houses 1 or 2.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. This means the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. This means the rose bouquet person can only be in house 1 or 3.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:
  - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the refined analysis, we can deduce the following:

- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic (since the violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic and the violinist cannot be in the fourth house)
- House 2: Fantasy Book Enthusiast and Root Beer Lover (since they live next to each other and the science fiction book fanatic is in house 3)
- House 1: History Book Buff (since the history book buff lives directly left of the percussionist and the percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader)
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 4: Carnations (since the person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist)
- House 5: Tulips (already given)

From the above deductions, the person who likes milk must live in house 2, as the person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other, and the only remaining house next to house 3 (science fiction book fanatic) is house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes milk lives is 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person step by step:

1. **First house**: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
2. **Fourth house**: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Third house**: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
4. **Second house**: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Given the constraints, the only possible positions for the swimmer and the cricketer are:
- Cricketer in the first house (yellow), and swimmer in the third house (blue).
- Cricketer in the third house (blue), and swimmer in the first house (yellow).

Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the cricketer must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house.

Now, the second house must be occupied by the person who likes white and the person who is eating oranges. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (yellow), and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the first house (yellow). Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.

This leaves the person who owns an SUV in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The answer is (D) 2."
"The number of the house where the person who likes blue lives is **1**.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. From clue 2, the cellist also lives in house 1. This creates a contradiction because only one person can live in each house. Therefore, we need to reassess.

Considering the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1, the cellist must live in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the person who likes green and house 2 for the person who likes red.

From clue 3, the person who likes green (living in house 1) lives to the left of the person who likes red (living in house 2). This is consistent with our reassessment.

Now, we need to determine the mystery book reader. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green and the person who likes green (living in house 1) likes red, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues and the logical deductions:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- If Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals, then Person 2 (House 2) must own horses.
- If Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals, then Person 1 (House 1) must own horses.
- The history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

Considering these constraints:

1. If Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti, then Person 2 (House 2) must be the history book buff.
2. If Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti, then Person 1 (House 1) must be the history book buff.

Given that the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, and considering the possible positions:

- If Person 1 (House 1) is the history book buff, then Person 2 (House 2) must be the person who ate spaghetti.
- If Person 2 (House 2) is the history book buff, then Person 1 (House 1) must be the person who ate spaghetti.

Since the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti, the only consistent arrangement is:

- Person 1 (House 1) is the history book buff.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the person who ate spaghetti.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is **2**."
"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).

- House 1: Mystery book reader (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

"The person who likes white lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (A) 1.
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"The person who drives a minivan lives in house number 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"Based on the given clues, the correct house where the dog owner lives is house 3.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 3."
"The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who had pizza:

1. **Carnations in House 1.**
2. **Apples in House 2.**
3. **Banana not between pianist and person eating apples.**
4. **Stew and grilled cheese next to each other.**
5. **Guitarist not in House 3.**
6. **Pizza to the right of saxophonist.**
7. **Piano not in House 5.**
8. **Tulips not in House 3.**
9. **Daffodils to the left of roses.**
10. **Banana not in House 4.**
11. **Two houses between banana and pianist.**
12. **Pizza to the right of saxophonist.**
13. **Pizza not in House 5.**

Let's start by placing the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the daffodils must be to the left of the roses, and the roses cannot be in House 3 (Clue 8), the only possible positions for the daffodils and roses are:

- Daffodils in House 2, roses in House 3.
- Daffodils in House 3, roses in House 4.
- Daffodils in House 4, roses in House 5.

However, since the daffodils must be to the left of the roses, the only valid placement is:
- Daffodils in House 2, roses in House 3.

Next, we place the person who has a bouquet of tulips. Since tulips cannot be in House 3 (Clue 8), the only possible positions are:
- Tulips in House 1, carnations in House 1 (already placed).
- Tulips in House 4, carnations in House 4 (already placed).
- Tulips in House 5, carnations in House 5 (already placed).

Thus, tulips must be in House 1, and carnations in House 1 (already placed).

Now, we place the person who has a carnations arrangement (House 1) and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2). The remaining houses are 3, 4, and 5.

Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (House 2) and the person who has a carnations arrangement (House 1) are next to each other, we can place the remaining flowers in the remaining houses.

Next, we place the person who has a bouquet of tulips (House 1) and the person who has a carnations arrangement (House 1). This leaves us with the remaining houses for the flowers.

Now, let's place the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the lilies must be in a house that is not already occupied by carnations, daffodils, tulips, or roses, the only possible house is House 4.

This leaves us with House 5 for the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

Now, we place the person who has a bouquet of lilies (House 5) and the person who has a carnations arrangement (House 1). The remaining houses are 2 and 3.

Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies (House 5) and the person who has a carnations arrangement (House 1) are next to each other, we can place the remaining flowers in the remaining houses.

Finally, we place the person who has a bouquet of lilies (House 5) and the person who has a carnations arrangement (House 1). The remaining houses are 2 and 3.

Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies (House 5) and the person who has a carnations arrangement (House 1) are next to each other, we can place the remaining flowers in the remaining houses.

Given the constraints, the only valid placement for the person who had pizza (Clue 12) is in House 4.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."

- House 4: Fried rice

Now, we need to place the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who ate spaghetti:
- Clue 8 indicates that the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house.

- House 3: Spaghetti

Finally, we need to place the person who likes white and the person who likes green:
- Clue 5 indicates that the person who likes white must be in the second house, but we already have the percussionist in the second house. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

Let's re-evaluate:
- House 2: Blue
- House 3: Yellow
- House 1: Pizza
- House 4: Fried rice

Now, we need to place the person who likes green and the person who likes white:
- Clue 2 indicates that the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.
- House 4: Green
- Clue 5 indicates that the person who likes white must be in the first house, but we already have the percussionist in the second house. This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate.

Let's re-evaluate:
- House 2: Blue
- House 3: Yellow
- House 1: Pizza
- House 4: Green

Finally, we need to place the person who likes white and the person who likes green:
- Clue 5 indicates that the person who likes white must be in the first house, and the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.
- House 1: White
- House 4: Green

Now, we need to place the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who likes yellow:
- Clue 13 indicates that the guitarist must be in the first house, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house.
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Vase of tulips

Finally, we need to place the person who likes yellow and the person who likes white:
- Clue 1 indicates that the person who likes yellow must be in the third house.
- House 3: Yellow

So, the final arrangement is:
1. Pizza
2. Guitarist
3. Yellow
4. Green

Therefore, the cellist (who plays the cello) must live in the second house.

The number of the house where the cellist lives is **2**.

(C) 2"

"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the root beer lover cannot be in the second house (Clue 1), the root beer lover must be in the first house.
- The pianist and the cellist must be in adjacent houses, with the pianist in the house to the left of the cellist (Clue 2).

Therefore, the pianist must be in the first house and the cellist must be in the second house.

The number of the house where the root beer lover lives is 1.

The correct option is (A) 1."
"The person who has the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4."
"The pianist lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2."
"The person who ate fried rice lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other (Clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must live in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The coffee drinker (CD) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW).
2. The science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in the first house (house 1).

From these clues, we can deduce:

- The SF lives in house 1.
- The CD cannot be in house 1, so the CD must be in house 2.
- The SW cannot be in house 1, so the SW must be in house 1.
- This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to the remaining houses.

Since the SF is in house 1, the CD must be in house 2. This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to house 1.

Since the CD (coffee drinker) is in house 2, the water drinker must be in house 1. This leaves the romance book lover to be in house 2.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
The number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is (A) 1.
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means the person who likes yellow and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, with the person who likes yellow in the house directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, then the person who likes white must be in house 3 (since there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan). This would mean the person who likes yellow must be in house 2, which contradicts the condition that the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
- If the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, then the person who likes white must be in house 1 (since there is one house between the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan). This means the person who likes yellow must be in house 2, which satisfies the condition that the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who owns horses lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"The person who drives a truck lives in House 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5."
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with the carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.
2. The houses are numbered 1 and 2, with house 1 being the left house and house 2 being the right house.

From clue 1, the person with the carnations arrangement (C) must be in house 1, and the dog owner (D) must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.
   - If the person drinking water is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means if the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person liking yellow must be in house 2.
   - If the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person liking yellow must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is **2**."
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct option is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 3, and the person who only drinks water cannot be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - This means the violinist can only be in houses 2 or 3.

Given the tea drinker is in house 1, we can deduce the following:

- The cellist cannot be in house 3 (from Clue 1).
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (from Clue 4).
- The guitarist cannot be in house 3 (since the violinist cannot be there and there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

So, the possible positions for the cellist and the guitarist are:
- Cellist in house 2 (since the cellist cannot be in house 3).
- Guitarist in house 3 (since the cellist is in house 2 and there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

Let's verify this:
- The tea drinker is in house 1.
- The cellist is in house 2.
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), so the violinist must be in house 2 (but that's already taken by the cellist), so the violinist must be in house 3.
- The guitarist must be in house 3.

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, the third house is occupied by someone wearing sandals.
From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing sandals is in the third house.
From Clue 4, the fifth house is occupied by the tea drinker.
From Clue 2, the first house is not occupied by the person wearing running shoes.
From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water (in the fourth house) must be to the left of the person who is wearing boots (in the first house).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who is wearing boots
- Second house: Person who is wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person who likes milk (and wearing sandals)
- Fourth house: Person who only drinks water
- Fifth house: Person who drinks tea

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who is eating a banana step by step:

1. **Pianist and Horse Owner**: The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. **Apples and Kiwis**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.

4. **Apples in Second House**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the second house.
5. **Fried Rice and Oranges**: The person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
6. **Dog Owner and First House**: The dog owner does not live in the first house.
7. **Bird Keeper in Second House**: The bird keeper lives in the second house.
8. **Horse and Grilled Cheese**: The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
9. **Stew and Banana**: The person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
10. **Saxophonist and Grilled Cheese**: The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other.
11. **Tennis Player and Baseball Player**: The tennis player and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
12. **Basketball Player and Cat Lover**: The basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover.
13. **Saxophonist and Golfer**: There is one house between where the saxophonist lives and where the golfer lives.
14. **Mangos and Horse**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
15. **Tennis Player in First House**: The tennis player lives in the first house.
16. **Percussionist in Fourth House**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
17. **Pianist Not in Third House**: The pianist does not live in the third house.
18. **Apples and Golfer**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
19. **Pizza and Fifth House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 15, the tennis player lives in the first house.

From clue 16, the percussionist lives in the fourth house.

From clue 17, the pianist does not live in the third house.

From clue 18, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. Since the pianist lives in the third house (from clue 17), the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 19, the person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 14, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the pianist lives in the third house, the person who owns horses must live in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 13, the saxophonist and the golfer live one house apart. Since the saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other (clue 10), the saxophonist must live in the second or third house. Given the pianist is in the third house, the saxophonist must live in the second house.

From clue 12, the tennis player and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the tennis player is in the first house, the baseball player must live in the second house.

From clue 7, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the saxophonist lives in the second house, the person who owns horses must live in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 11, the saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist lives in the second house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

From clue 6, the dog owner does not live in the first house. Since the tennis player lives in the first house, the dog owner must live in the second house. But the second house is already occupied by the saxophonist, so the dog owner must live in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who is eating apples does not live in the second house. Since the saxophonist lives in the second house, the person who is eating apples must live in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 1, the pianist lives directly left of the person who owns horses. Since the pianist lives in the third house, the person who owns horses must live in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana must live in the fourth or fifth house, and the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the fifth house.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is **5**.

The answer is (A) 5."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.

From Clue 1, we deduce:
- The bird keeper must be in house 1 because the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2, and the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 1.
- Therefore, the bird keeper is in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The percussionist does not live in house 2, so the percussionist must live in house 1.

This leaves the guitarist and the pizza eater to be placed in houses 1 and 2. Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2, the guitarist and the pizza eater must be in the remaining houses.

Since the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2 (because the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the pizza eater cannot be in house 2).

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

4. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
5. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives.
6. The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house.

From Clue 6, we know the person who is eating grapes is in house 2. 

From Clue 5, the person who likes white and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house between them. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who likes red must be in house 3.

From Clue 4, the person who likes green and the person who likes yellow must be in houses 1 and 4, with one house between them. Since the person who likes white is in house 1, the person who likes green must be in house 1 and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4.

From Clue 3, the person who likes white is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, which is consistent with Clue 5.

From Clue 1, the person who likes red (in house 3) lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4.

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. The correct answer is (A) 4."

Therefore, the correct option is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means if the daffodils are in house \(X\), the phone must be in house \(X+1\).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes root beer lives in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who has a television lives in either house 1 or house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means if the person with the television is in house \(X\), the person with the vase of tulips must be in house \(X-1\).

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in house 1. From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2. From Clue 4, the person who has a television cannot live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or house 3. From Clue 5, if the person with the television lives in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 (which contradicts Clue 2). Therefore, the person with the television must live in house 3.

This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the person who likes root beer.

### Conclusion

The person who likes root beer lives in house 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"The person who has a computer lives in House 2.

To elaborate on the reasoning:

1. **Clue 1 and Clue 2**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader must be somewhere to the left of the percussionist, and the percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

2. **Clue 3**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the percussionist.

3. **Clue 4**: There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. This means the saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, and the person who had pizza must be in the second or fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader.

5. **Clue 6**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. This means the flutist must be in a house to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

6. **Clue 7**: The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the guitarist must be in the first or second house, and the percussionist must be in the third or fourth house.

7. **Clue 8**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese eater must be in adjacent houses, and the grilled cheese eater must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

8. **Clue 9**: There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the history book buff must be in the house directly to the right or left of the mystery book reader.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the first, second, fourth, or fifth houses.

By analyzing these clues, we deduced the following:
- The saxophonist is in the second house.
- The mystery book reader is in the first house.
- The guitarist is in the second house (but this is already occupied by the saxophonist, so the guitarist must be in the first house).
- The percussionist must be in the fourth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic is in the first house (but this is already occupied by the mystery book reader).
- The fantasy book enthusiast is in the third house.
- The flutist is in the fourth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti is in the fourth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese is in the fifth house.

Thus, the percussionist lives in the fourth house."
"The person who is eating mangos lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5."
"The saxophonist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - Given the positions of the cellist and the mystery book reader, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this scenario is not possible.

2. **Clue 2**: The dog owner does not live in the second house.
   - This means the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 3 if the dog owner lives in house 1.
   - The person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 if the dog owner lives in house 3.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

- **If the dog owner is in house 1**:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1).
  - The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 1.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 (Clue 3).

- **If the dog owner is in house 3**:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The bird keeper must be in house 1 or house 2.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 3.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 (Clue 3).

From the above analysis, the only consistent scenario is when the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them as follows:

1. **House 4: Swimmer**
2. **House 3: Banana**
3. **House 2: Computer**
4. **House 1: Basketball Player**

Next, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- **Person with a phone** lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
- **Person with a gameboy** lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
- **Person with a phone** lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
- **Person with a gameboy** lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
- **Person with a phone** lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
- **Person with a gameboy** lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
- **Person with a phone** lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
- **Person with a gameboy** lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
- **Person with a phone** lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
- **Person with a gameboy** lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
- **Person with a phone** lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
- **Person with a gameboy** lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.

Given the constraints, we can place the remaining characteristics:
- **Person with a phone** must be in House 1 (since House 2 is occupied by the computer).
- **Person with a gameboy** must be in House 3 (since House 4 is occupied by the rose bouquet).

So, the arrangement is:
- **House 1: Basketball Player**
- **House 2: Computer**
- **House 3: Banana**
- **House 4: Rose Bouquet**

The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1 (since House 2 is occupied by the computer and House 4 is occupied by the rose bouquet).

Thus, the person who is wearing sandals lives in **House 1**.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating mangos.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not horses.

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, and vice versa.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not banana.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not horses.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the person eating a banana is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 2. This leaves house 3 and house 4 for the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis.

Since the person eating kiwis must be next to the bird keeper (Clue 3), and house 1 is taken by the person eating mangos, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Eating mangos.
- House 2: Not horses, not banana, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana, bird keeper.
- House 4: Not horses, owns horses.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

1. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives in the first house (House 1).
   - House 1: Mystery book reader

2. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the bird keeper must be in adjacent houses, and since the mystery book reader is in House 1, the only possible adjacent houses are Houses 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the bird keeper must live in House 3 (since the romance book lover cannot live in House 3, and the bird keeper must be in an adjacent house).

4. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
   - Since the bird keeper lives in House 3, the romance book lover must live in House 2.

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
   - This directly tells us the coffee drinker lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, with the apple eater to the left of the water drinker.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 2, 3, or 4.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 1 or 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the apple eater must be in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.
   - This means the kiwi eater lives in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives in house 2.
- From Clue 4, the mangos eater cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 4.
- From Clue 6, the kiwi eater cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1, 2, or 4.
- From Clue 2, the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, and the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker.
- From Clue 5, the apple eater must be to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's place the people based on these constraints:

- If the mangos eater is in house 1, then the kiwi eater must be in house 4 (since they cannot be in house 3).
- The apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Mangos eater
  - House 2: Coffee drinker (Clue 1)
  - House 3: Apple eater
  - House 4: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The mangos eater is in house 1.
- The kiwi eater is in house 4.
- The water drinker is in house 4.

- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pianist
- House 5: Grapes

The remaining person (the person who is eating mangos) must be in house 1 (since the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the violinist, and the violinist is in house 1).

   - This means the minivan driver cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the minivan driver).

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.
- The truck driver is to the right of the root beer lover.
- The minivan driver is not in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"The person who drives a truck lives in house 3. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 3."
"The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following placements:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in House 1, and the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes

4. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - This is already confirmed as House 3.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This is already confirmed as House 1.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.
- The person who has a television must be in House 4.
- The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who has a phone must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"The bird keeper lives in house number 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The saxophonist lives in house 1.
2. The golfer lives in house 2.
3. The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other, so the romance book lover must be in house 2.
4. The baseball player and the person eating grapes live next to each other, and since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1.
5. The tea drinker and the person eating grapes live next to each other, and since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 1.

Thus, the assignments are:
- House 1: Tea drinker, Baseball player
- House 2: Romance book lover, Golfer, Person eating grapes

Therefore, the person eating mangos must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
The number of the house where the romance book lover lives is (B) 2.
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
3. The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we can deduce that the first house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing boots.

Since the first house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing boots, the second house must be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies and the person wearing high heels. This leaves the third house to be occupied by the person with the remaining flowers (roses) and the person wearing the remaining shoes (running shoes).

Therefore, the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions, we can determine the correct arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them. Here's a step-by-step deduction:

2. **Clue 14**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player. This means the tennis player cannot be in the first house.
3. **Clue 3**: The basketball player and the tennis player are directly adjacent. This means they must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers are directly adjacent. This means they must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
5. **Clue 5**: The tea drinker and the person who had pizza are directly adjacent. This means they must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
6. **Clue 6**: The soccer player is to the right of the person who had stew. This means the person who had stew cannot be in the fifth house.
7. **Clue 8**: The person who only drinks water is not in the fifth house.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding houses step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - If Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
   - If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

2. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.
   - If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes.

3. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - If Person 1 (House 1) wears boots, then Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.
   - If Person 2 (House 2) wears boots, then Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader.

From Clue 3, if Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck. This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow because it would contradict Clue 1 (Person 1 eats grapes).

Thus, Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow. This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.
- Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.

From Clue 2, if Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) wears boots. This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 2**.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Based on the given clues and the logical deductions, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 11. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 5"
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
4. There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
5. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
6. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
7. The person who likes green lives directly to the left of the person who likes red.
8. There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
9. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
10. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
11. The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.

From these clues, we can establish the following:

- House 1: Spaghetti
- House 2: White (romance book lover)
- House 3: Pizza (green)
- House 4: Science fiction book fanatic (red)

Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover, and the person who likes green lives directly to the left of the person who likes red, we can place the remaining characteristics:

- House 2: White (romance book lover)
- House 3: Pizza (green)
- House 4: Science fiction book fanatic (red)

The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player, and the person who likes blue lives directly next to the violinist. This means:

- House 2: White (romance book lover)
- House 3: Pizza (green)
- House 4: Science fiction book fanatic (red)
- House 1: Spaghetti (soccer player)
- House 2: Violinist (blue)
- House 3: Pizza (green)
- House 4: Saxophonist (grilled cheese)

Since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player, and the person who likes blue lives directly next to the violinist, the only remaining house for the person who had pizza is house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The violinist lives in the second house.
2. The basketball player also lives in the second house.
3. The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer.

From Clue 2, the violinist and basketball player both live in the second house. This leaves the cricketer and the cellist to be placed in the first and third houses, respectively. Since the cellist must live to the right of the cricketer (Clue 1), the cricketer must be in the first house and the cellist in the third house.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

The soccer player must therefore live in the first house.

The number of the house where the soccer player lives is **(A) 1**."

10. **Clue 10**: The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.

From Clue 11, the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns horses.

From Clue 2, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house, which is consistent with Clue 11.

From Clue 3, the flutist lives in the fourth house, which is consistent with Clue 2.

From Clue 4, the tennis player does not live in the fourth house. So, the tennis player must live in one of the other houses (1, 2, or 3).

From Clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house. So, the guitarist must live in either the first or the second house.

From Clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house. So, the violinist must live in either the first or the second house.

From Clue 7, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must live in the first or second house, and the guitarist must live in the third or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the guitarist must live in the third house. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the first or second house.

From Clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other. This means they must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player must live in the first or second house, and the fish enthusiast must live in the third or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.

From Clue 10, the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other. This means they must be in adjacent houses.

Given all these constraints, let's summarize:
- Fourth house: Person who owns horses (Clue 11)
- Third house: Guitarist (Clue 7)
- Second house: Cricketer (Clue 7)
- First house: Tennis player (Clue 4)
- First or second house: Fish enthusiast (Clue 9)
- First or second house: Basketball player (Clue 9)
- First or second house: Root beer lover (Clue 8)
- First or second house: Person who only drinks water (Clue 10)

Since the fish enthusiast must live somewhere to the right of the basketball player, and the basketball player must be in the first or second house, the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.

Therefore, the fish enthusiast lives in the third house. The correct answer is (C) 3."

   - Fourth house: Person owning an SUV.

5. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

6. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - The second house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, so the first house (person eating oranges) and the third house (person eating apples) are to the left of the second house. Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must be in the first house, and the person driving a convertible must be in the sixth house.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The fifth house is occupied by the person eating grapes, and the sixth house is occupied by the person driving a convertible. Therefore, the person who owns a sedan must be in the fifth house.

8. **Clue 6:** There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - The person with the carnations arrangement is in the fifth house, and the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in the fourth house.

9. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - The second house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, and the third house is occupied by the person eating apples. Therefore, the person driving a minivan must be in the third house.

1. Person eating oranges
2. Person with the bouquet of daffodils
3. Person eating apples
4. Person eating a banana
5. Person owning an SUV

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the romance book lover must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.

This leaves house 2 for the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 2 must be the bird keeper.
- The person in house 2 must have a gameboy (since the computer is in house 1).
- The person in house 2 must be the guitarist.

Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the bird keeper lives is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the house where the person who has a computer lives:

1. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house (house 4).
2. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house (house 2).

- House 5: Not science fiction book fanatic

Since the person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips, we can infer the following:
- The person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4 or 5.

"Given the context of Apollo from Greek mythology and D'Artagnan from Alexandre Dumas' ""The Three Musketeers,"" it is challenging to definitively state whether Apollo could defeat D'Artagnan. However, considering D'Artagnan's known attributes as a skilled musketeer and fighter, it is reasonable to assume that he would be a formidable opponent.

Apollo, while often depicted as a powerful and wise figure, is a god with supernatural abilities. Without specific information on Apollo's physical combat prowess, it is difficult to conclude that he could defeat D'Artagnan.

Avoiding internet trolls on Reddit is generally not possible due to their nature as part of the community. However, there are several strategies you can employ to minimize their impact:

1. **Ignore and Report**: Trolls often thrive on attention. Ignoring their posts and reporting them to Reddit can help reduce their visibility and impact.
2. **Use Filters and Subreddit Settings**: Some subreddits have filters or settings that can help reduce the number of troll posts you see.
3. **Stay Alert and Vigilant**: Be aware of the signs of troll behavior and be prepared to take action if necessary.
4. **Engage with Respect**: Sometimes, engaging with trolls in a respectful manner can help defuse the situation. However, this is not always effective and can sometimes escalate the situation.
5. **Use Moderators**: If a troll is causing significant disruption, you can flag the post or the user to the subreddit's moderators, who can take action.

These strategies can help mitigate the presence of trolls, but they are not foolproof and trolls may still be a part of the Reddit community."

Iris, as the goddess of the rainbow and messenger of the gods, is known for her swift and direct communication and speed. Hermes, the god of trade, commerce, and thievery, is resourceful, cunning, and quick-witted.

A UPS job involves handling packages efficiently, ensuring timely delivery, and managing inventory. Iris would excel in the speed and communication aspects, while Hermes might struggle with the more routine and detail-oriented tasks such as inventory management and customer service.

Therefore, while Iris and Hermes would complement each other in terms of speed and communication, Hermes might find it challenging to handle the more mundane and repetitive tasks of a UPS job.

Wool can typically be machine washed, but it's important to handle it with care. Here are some considerations:

1. **Machine Washing**: Wool can be washed in a washing machine, but it's best to use a gentle cycle and a wool or delicates detergent. Avoid using fabric softeners, as they can damage the wool fibers.

2. **Hand Washing**: Hand washing is also an option, especially for delicate items or when you want to ensure the garment is treated with extra care. Use a gentle detergent and a basin or sink with enough water to submerge the garment. Gently agitate the wool in the water, then rinse thoroughly.

3. **Drying**: Wool should be air-dried or tumble-dried on a low heat setting. Avoid drying wool in direct sunlight, as it can cause color fading and shrinkage.

4. **Ironing**: Wool can be ironed, but it's best to do so on a low heat setting and using a pressing cloth to protect the fabric.

So, while wool can be machine washed, it's not necessary to hand wash it only. The choice between machine washing and hand washing depends on the specific garment and your preference for care."
