"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
9. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
11. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
12. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. So, house 3 is occupied by the person wearing high heels.

Now, let's use Clue 11 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the root beer lover and the person who is eating mangos. Since the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be next to each other.

Given that the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the coffee drinker, and the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3 and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(B) 2**."
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. The violinist lives in House 1.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 1.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.
4. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
7. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.
8. The violinist lives in the first house.

From these, we can deduce:
- House 1: Violinist (and also the person who ate spaghetti)
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice (and also the history book buff)
- House 2: Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone (since they live next to each other)

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist and the violinist is in House 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1. This leaves House 2 for the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips must live in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues, let's break it down:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. This means the person driving a truck must live in house 1 because the person driving a truck is the only other car type left.

From Clue 1, the person driving a convertible must live directly left of the history book buff. Since the person driving a truck is in house 1, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2. Therefore, the history book buff must be in house 1.

So, the person in house 1 (convertible driver) is a mystery book reader and is wearing sandals. The person in house 2 (truck driver) is a history book buff and is wearing boots.

Thus, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff must be in House 4 and the mystery book reader in House 3.

4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - Since the mystery book reader is in House 3, the swimmer must be in House 2.

5. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Romance book lover
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"The mystery book reader lives in the third house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 3."
"The person who has a computer lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to determine where the coffee drinker lives:

1. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
6. **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are in the same house, which contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, Clue 5 must be incorrect, and the root beer lover does not live in the third house. This means the root beer lover must live in one of the other houses.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. So, the tea drinker must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.

Let's summarize the information we have so far:
- The third house is occupied by the root beer lover.
- The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
- The tea drinker is not in the second house.

Let's try to place the people based on the clues:

1. The root beer lover is in the third house.
2. The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
3. The tea drinker is not in the second house.

If the tea drinker is in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Pianist does not live in the first house.**
2. **Person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.**
3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other. Also, the person eating kiwis must be to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist next to each other. Also, the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio must be next to each other.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, the person eating oranges must be directly left of the person with a television.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Thus, the person with a television lives in house 8.

"Given the clues, let's piece together the information step by step:

1. The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"The cellist lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3."

- House 4 (Minivan driver): Root beer lover.
- House 3 (Root beer lover): Root beer lover.
- House 2 (Swimmer): The swimmer must be to the left of the sedan owner, and the sedan owner must be to the left of the truck driver. Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 2.
- House 1 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 1.
- House 4 (Minivan driver): The minivan driver lives in house 4.
- House 3 (Root beer lover): The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- House 2 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 2.

- House 3 (Root beer lover): The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- House 4 (Minivan driver): The minivan driver lives in house 4.
- House 2 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 2.
- House 1 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 1.
- House 3 (Root beer lover): The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- House 4 (Minivan driver): The minivan driver lives in house 4.

From Clue 8, the basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the truck driver must be in house 1 (as house 1 is the only house left for the truck driver to live in), the basketball player must be in house 2.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in house 2, the person with the lilies must be in house 3 or 4. But since the root beer lover is already in house 3, the person with the lilies must be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the truck driver is in house 1, the person with carnations must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, the swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the swimmer is in house 1, the person who owns a sedan must be in house 2.

From Clue 6, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the tennis player is in house 1 and the tea drinker must be in house 4, the tennis player is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 4.

From Clue 1, there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives. Since the tennis player is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1 (Swimmer): The swimmer.
- House 2 (Basketball player): The basketball player.
- House 3 (Coffee drinker): The coffee drinker.
- House 4 (Minivan driver): The minivan driver.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(A) 1**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person driving a minivan.
3. The person driving a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
5. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's analyze:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 1, the person eating apples must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person eating oranges cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1 or 3.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3.

Considering the positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1, then the person eating apples must be in house 2 (since they are to the left of the person driving a minivan).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3.
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (since they are to the right of the science fiction book fanatic).
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red (in house 2) lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the person who likes white. Since the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house (Clue 2), and the person who likes white is in house 1, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The correct option is (A) 3."
"The person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

So, the correct answer is (A) 3."
"The root beer lover lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"The science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"The person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house (number 2). Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The violinist lives in house 2. 

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house number 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"The person who has a computer lives in house 2.

So, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
   - This means the golfer must be in House 2 and the science fiction book fanatic in House 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - This means they must be in adjacent houses. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1, the pizza-eater and history book buff must be in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means the guitarist and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

Given these constraints, let's place the people:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), HBB (history book buff)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), D (person with bouquet of daffodils), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 2 and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 2 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"

4. **House 4: Violinist (given)**

   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the correct house number where the person who likes white lives.

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (house 1) because the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in the fourth house (house 4).

From clue 3, we know the person who likes white lives in one of the houses 2, 3, or 4. Since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in the fourth house (house 4), the person who likes white must be in either house 2 or 3.

Given that the person who likes white cannot be in the first house (house 1), and considering the other constraints, we can deduce the following:

- The person who likes white cannot be in house 1.
- The person who likes white cannot be in house 4 because the person who is wearing running shoes is there.
- The person who likes white must be in either house 2 or 3.

Since the person who likes white lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in house 4, the only logical place for the person who likes white is in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes white lives is 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."

3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow. So, the third house is:
- Yellow

From clue 3, the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer. So, the second house is:
- Root beer

From clue 1, the person who likes blue must be to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must be in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the person who likes white must be to the right of the person who only drinks water. This doesn't give us a specific house number but confirms the order.

From clue 2, the person who likes milk must be to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the yellow person is in the third house, the milk person must be in the fourth house, but we already deduced that the blue person is in the fourth house. Therefore, the milk person must be in the fourth house, and the white person must be in the second house, which is occupied by the root beer lover.

So, the only house left for the person who likes white is the first house, and the only house left for the person who only drinks water is the first house.

2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the phone and SUV must be adjacent, with the phone to the left of the SUV.

4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

From the above, we know:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be adjacent to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 2: Phone
- House 4: SUV

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

1. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

4. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fried rice eater and fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 3.

5. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

6. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

Now, let's place the known elements:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater

Since the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively, and the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, the only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"The person who owns horses lives in House 3.

So, the correct option is (C) 3."
"The person who likes milk lives in the third house. Therefore, the correct option is:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

   - This means the person wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

   - This means the person who likes white and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in the first house, so the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 3.

From Clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the history book buff and the guitarist. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the guitarist must be in the fifth house, and the history book buff must be in the second house.

3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (who likes green) lives in the first house, the person who likes red must live in the second house (number 2).

This means:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green.
- The person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals, then Person 2 (House 2) must own horses.
   - If Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals, then Person 1 (House 1) must own horses.

2. **Clue 2**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti, then Person 2 (House 2) must be the history book buff.

From Clue 1, we know that the person wearing sandals and the person owning horses must be adjacent. From Clue 2, we know that the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's consider the possible arrangements:

"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).
4. **Tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the tennis player is in house \(i+1\) or later.
5. **There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet**: This means if the rose bouquet is in house \(i\), the daffodils are in house \(i+1\) or \(i-1\).
6. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\).

### Analyzing the Clues:
- **Clue 6**: Rose bouquet in house 3.
- **Clue 4**: Fantasy book enthusiast in house 2 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer).

### Placing the People:
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player (since the tennis player does not live in house 4, and the only available house is house 4).
- House 1: Mystery book reader (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

### Final Placement:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.

"Let's break down the clues step by step to determine where the person who had pizza lives.

1. **Carnations in House 1.**
   - House 1: Carnations

2. **Apples in House 2.**
   - House 2: Apples

3. **Banana not between pianist and pizza.**
   - We need to place the banana and the pianist such that the pizza is not between them.

   - This means they are in consecutive houses.

5. **Pianist not in House 5.**
   - House 5: Not pianist

6. **Guitarist not in House 3.**
   - House 3: Not guitarist

7. **Pizza to the right of saxophonist.**

   - House 2: Apples
   - House 3: Not daffodils

9. **Two houses between banana and pianist.**
   - This means the pianist is either in House 3 or House 4, and the banana is in House 1 or House 2.

10. **Guitarist not in House 3.**
    - House 3: Not guitarist

11. **Pizza to the right of saxophonist.**

- **Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

- **Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.

"The root beer lover lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct option is:

(A) 1"
"The person who has the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4."
"The pianist lives in house 2. So, the correct answer is (D) 2."
"The person who ate fried rice lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people. From clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person drinking water, Person wearing sandals
- House 2: Person eating kiwis, Person liking yellow

Since the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).

6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
   - This means the grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house.

7. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the gameboy and computer must be in adjacent houses.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.
   - The computer cannot be in house 4.

Let's place the pizza in house 4:
- House 4: Pizza

Now, the computer and gameboy must be adjacent and not in house 4:
- Computer and gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

Let's try placing the computer in house 1:
- House 1: Computer
- House 4: Pizza

The gameboy must be in house 2:
- House 2: Gameboy

Now, the radio cannot be in house 4 and must be separated by one house from the grilled cheese:
- Grilled cheese and radio must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

If grilled cheese is in house 1:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Radio

This leaves house 3 for the computer and house 5 for the television:
- House 3: Computer
- House 5: Television

Now, the fried rice and gameboy must be separated by one house:
- Fried rice must be in house 3 or 5.

Since house 3 is already occupied by the computer, fried rice must be in house 5:
- House 5: Fried rice

This leaves house 3 for the gameboy:
- House 3: Gameboy

This configuration is consistent with all clues:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried rice

The person who ate spaghetti must be directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese, so:
- House 2: Spaghetti

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person eating a banana step by step:

1. **Pianist and Horse Owner**: The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. **Apples and Kiwis**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Baseball Player and Fried Rice**: The baseball player and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
4. **Apples in Second House**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the second house.
5. **Fried Rice and Oranges**: The person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
6. **Dog Owner and First House**: The dog owner does not live in the first house.
7. **Bird Keeper in Second House**: The bird keeper lives in the second house.
8. **Horse and Grilled Cheese**: The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
9. **Stew and Banana**: The person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
10. **Saxophonist and Grilled Cheese**: The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other.
11. **Tennis Player and Baseball Player**: The tennis player and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
12. **Basketball Player and Cat Lover**: The basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover.
13. **Saxophonist and Golfer**: There is one house between where the saxophonist lives and where the golfer lives.
14. **Mangos and Horse**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
15. **Tennis Player in First House**: The tennis player lives in the first house.
16. **Percussionist in Fourth House**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
17. **Pianist Not in Third House**: The pianist does not live in the third house.
18. **Apples and Golfer**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
19. **Pizza and Fifth House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 15, the tennis player lives in the first house. From clue 16, the percussionist lives in the fourth house. From clue 17, the pianist does not live in the third house. From clue 18, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. From clue 19, the person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

Given that the pianist does not live in the third house, and considering the positions of the other musicians and the constraints, the pianist must live in the second house. This leaves the first house for the tennis player, the second house for the bird keeper, the third house for the saxophonist, the fourth house for the percussionist, and the fifth house for the pianist.

From clue 9, the person who is eating a banana must live directly next to the person who had stew. Given the positions, the only house left for the person eating a banana is the fifth house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is **5**."
"The person who had pizza lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in house number 3. 

So, the correct option is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3**: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4**: The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. **Clue 6**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. **Clue 8**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 10, we know the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses, respectively, or the second and third houses, respectively. However, Clue 9 tells us the fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house and the flutist in the third house.

Now, let's consider Clue 5 and Clue 8:
- Clue 5: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
- Clue 8: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

This means the person eating a banana and the person wearing running shoes must be in the first and second houses, respectively, or the second and third houses, respectively. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person eating a banana must be in the second house, and the person wearing running shoes must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person eating a banana (banana eater)
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes (running shoe wearer)
- Third house: Fish enthusiast

Next, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- Clue 7: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
- Clue 1: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.

Since the person wearing running shoes is in the first house, the person wearing loafers must be in the third house. This leaves the second house for the person eating oranges and the first house for the person wearing running shoes.

Now, we need to place the pianist and the cat lover:
- Clue 10: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist (which is already placed).
- Clue 2: The percussionist does not live in the second house (which is occupied by the person eating oranges).
- Clue 3: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house (which is occupied by the person eating oranges).
- Clue 4: The history book buff does not live in the second house (which is occupied by the person eating oranges).
- Clue 7: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
- Clue 1: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house (which is occupied by the person eating oranges).

Since the person wearing running shoes is in the first house, the person eating oranges is in the second house, and the person wearing loafers is in the third house, the only remaining house for the cat lover is the first house.

Thus, the cat lover lives in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house.

**The number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is 3.**

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4."
"The person who had stew lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct option is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3** tells us the root beer lover lives in house 1.
2. **Clue 2** states the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.
3. **Clue 4** says the person with the television does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3.
4. **Clue 5** indicates the person with the television lives somewhere to the right of the person with the vase of tulips.

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover is in house 1. From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water is in house 2. This leaves house 3 for the person who likes root beer.

Now, considering Clue 1, the person with the daffodils must be directly left of the person with the phone. Since the person with the daffodils is in house 2 (from Clue 2), the person with the phone must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the person who likes root beer.

Therefore, the person who likes root beer lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"The person who has a computer lives in House 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."

6. **The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
7. **The cricketer does not live in the third house.**

- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

From the above deductions, we can see that the person wearing loafers cannot live in the second house (Clue 5) and the person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the person eating a banana (Clue 11). Therefore, the person wearing loafers must live in House 1.

**The number of the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is 1.**

So, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"The bird keeper lives in house 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

From clue 2, the bird keeper and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the only possible adjacent houses are the second and third houses.

From clue 3, the romance book lover cannot be in the third house.

From clue 4, the person who owns horses cannot be in the third house. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the person who owns horses must be in the second house.

Therefore, the only house left for the romance book lover is the second house.

So, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(B) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person eating apples lives directly left of the person drinking water.
3. The person eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in house 2.

From Clue 3, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 1 or 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 6, the person eating kiwis cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2 or 4. Since the mangos eater is in house 4, the kiwis eater must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be to the left of the person drinking water. This means the apple eater and water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the mangos eater is in house 4, the apple eater must be in house 1 and the water drinker in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Person eating apples
- House 4: Person drinking water

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is 2. The correct answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"The person who is eating a banana lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"The correct option is (C) 1.

To elaborate on this without referencing the previous response:

Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person with a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

From Clue 6, we know the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

- If the flutist is in house 1, then the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2.
- If the flutist is in house 2, then the person who drives a minivan must be in house 3.

Let's consider both cases:

#### Case 1: Flutist in house 1, Minivan in house 2
- Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck must be in house 3.
- Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. So, the gameboy must be in house 3.
- Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. So, the cellist must be in house 2.
- Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 2, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 3. Since the gameboy is in house 3, the person with the television must be in house 1 and the person with high heels must be in house 3.
- Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 3 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

So, in this case, the percussionist lives in house 1.

#### Case 2: Flutist in house 2, Minivan in house 3
- Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck must be in house 1.
- Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. So, the gameboy must be in house 1.
- Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. So, the cellist must be in house 3.
- Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the gameboy is in house 1, the person with the television must be in house 2 and the person with high heels must be in house 1.
- Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

This case contradicts Clue 5, as the minivan cannot be in house 3 if the truck is in house 1. Therefore, this case is invalid.

Thus, the only valid configuration is the one where the flutist is in house 1, the minivan is in house 2, the cellist is in house 2, the gameboy is in house 3, the person with high heels is in house 3, the person with the television is in house 1, the person with boots is in house 3, and the percussionist is in house 1.

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 1."

2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (house 2).
3. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist, so the pianist must be in house 3.
4. **Clue 13**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils (house 2) lives directly left of the person who has a television (house 3).
5. **Clue 8**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in House 3 (since there is no house to the left of House 3), and the person who likes white must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 2 is already taken by the person who likes red, the person who likes white must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Gameboy

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.

   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

7. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - This is already confirmed as House 3.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.
- The person who has a television must be in House 4.
- The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

1. **Clue 2:** The basketball player lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Basketball player.

2. **Clue 3:** The violinist lives in the second house.

3. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
   - Since the violinist is in House 2, the cricketer and the cellist must be in Houses 1 and 3, respectively, with the cellist to the right of the cricketer.

From clue 4, the tennis player does not live in the fourth house. So, the tennis player must live in one of the other houses (1, 2, or 3).

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house. So, the guitarist must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house. So, the violinist must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 7, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must live in the first or second house, and the guitarist must live in the third or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the guitarist must live in the third house. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the first or second house.

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other. This means they must be in adjacent houses.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.

Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other. This means they must be in adjacent houses.

"During the pandemic, door-to-door advertising can indeed be considered inconsiderate. Here’s why:
