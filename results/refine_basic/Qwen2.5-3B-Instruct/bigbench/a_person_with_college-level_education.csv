Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The flutist lives in the second house.
   - This means the person with the flutes lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This indicates that the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips are adjacent, and the guitarist is to the left of the person with the vase of tulips.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - This means the carnations and the bouquet of lilies are adjacent, and the person with the carnations is to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.
   - Since the flutist lives in house number 2, the pianist must live in either house number 3 or house number 4.

Let's consider the possible positions for the pianist:

### Case 1: Pianist lives in house number 3
- If the pianist lives in house number 3, then the guitarist must live in house number 2 (since the flutist is already in house number 2), which contradicts the fact that the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips must be adjacent and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips. Therefore, the pianist cannot live in house number 3.

### Case 2: Pianist lives in house number 4
- If the pianist lives in house number 4, then the guitarist must live in house number 3 (since the flutist is in house number 2 and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips).

Now, let's place the remaining people:

- The person with the bouquet of lilies must be to the left of the person with the carnations arrangement.
- The person with the vase of tulips must be to the left of the guitarist (house number 3).

Let's place the remaining flowers and instruments:

- The person with the bouquet of lilies must be in house number 1 (since house number 2 is occupied by the flutist and house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist).
- The person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 4 (since house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist and house number 4 is occupied by the pianist).

This leaves house number 1 for the person with the bouquet of lilies and house number 4 for the person with the carnations arrangement. The person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 2 (since house number 2 is occupied by the flutist and house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist).

Thus, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating kiwis.

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Green.

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
   - This means they must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 7**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - This means the percussionist must live in either house 1 or house 3.

5. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
   - This means the cellist and the person with a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, this is not possible).

6. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
   - This means the person who only drinks water must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

7. **Clue 2**: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
   - This means the person who has a television must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

8. **Clue 1**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the root beer lover must be to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

Given these constraints, let's deduce the arrangement:

- **House 1**: Green (person who likes green)
- **House 2**: Blue (person who likes blue) and Gameboy (person who has a gameboy)
- **House 3**: Root beer (person who drinks root beer) and Kiwis (person who eats kiwis)

Since the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3, and the person who drinks root beer must be to the left of the person who drinks root beer, the only possible arrangement is:

- **House 1**: Green
- **House 2**: Blue, Gameboy
- **House 3**: Root beer, Kiwis

Thus, the cellist must live in house 3.

**Final Answer**: The number of the house where the cellist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the positions of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in house 3.
2. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker.

11. **Clue 9**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
12. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.

From Clue 3, we know the person in house 3 is wearing high heels. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

From Clue 11 and Clue 12, we know the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live next to each other. Also, the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker. This means the person who had pizza must be in house 2, and the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3. The person who is eating grapes must be in house 4.

From Clue 10, the person who had pizza (house 2) lives to the left of the coffee drinker. The coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the person who is eating grapes is in house 4. This means the coffee drinker must be in house 4, and the person who is eating grapes is in house 4.

From Clue 11, the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes. The person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2, and the root beer lover must be in house 1.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. The person who is eating spaghetti must be in house 1, and the person who is wearing running shoes (house 2) lives to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. The person who drives a truck must be in house 1, and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

From Clue 7, the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. The person who drives a truck (house 1) lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV (house 2). The tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the tea drinker lives in house 2.

The correct answer is **(A) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
   - This directly tells us that the grilled cheese eater lives in house number 5.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who had pizza lives in one of the houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the root beer lover and the person who had stew are neighbors, with the root beer lover being to the left of the person who had stew.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house number 5.

5. **Clue 5:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who ate spaghetti are neighbors, with the coffee drinker being to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in house number 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 5: Grilled cheese eater, person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 1: Person who had pizza (not in the first house)
- House 2: Person who had stew and the person who likes milk (must be neighbors)
- House 4: Person who only drinks water (not in the fifth house)

Since the person who only drinks water lives in house 5, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in houses 1 and 2. Given that the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors, they must be in houses 1 and 2.

Let's place the people:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with Clue 4.

Now, we need to place the root beer lover and the person who drinks coffee:
- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2, but since the person who had stew is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
- The coffee drinker must be in house 1 or 4, but house 4 is taken by the person who only drinks water, so the coffee drinker must be in house 1.

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with Clue 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Person who only drinks water (already placed)

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the soccer player and the person eating oranges cannot be in houses 1 and 3, but they must be in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges.

From Clue 1, the soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2. From Clue 4, the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges, which means the person eating oranges must be in house 1 and the person with daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 2, the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person with daffodils is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 1.

From Clue 3, the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos must be in house 1 (as the swimmer is in house 1 and the person with daffodils is in house 2), the person with tulips must be in house 3.

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's systematically deduce the house where the person with a vase of tulips lives.

1. **Violinist in House 1**
   - Violinist: House 1

2. **History book buff in House 3**
   - History book buff: House 3

3. **Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone are next to each other**
   - This means they must be in House 2 and House 3 or House 1 and House 2.

4. **Person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist**
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (where the violinist lives) and the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2.

5. **Person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house**
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti must live in House 1 or House 3.

6. **Person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist**
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in House 3 (where the person who ate fried rice lives).

7. **There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives**
   - This means the person with a radio must be in House 2 and the history book buff must be in House 3.

8. **Person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist**
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in House 1 (where the violinist lives) and the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2.

Given these constraints, let's deduce the positions:

- Violinist in House 1
- History book buff in House 3
- Person with a radio in House 2
- Person with a bouquet of daffodils in House 1 (since it must be to the left of the percussionist)
- Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone are next to each other, so they must be in House 2 and House 3.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips must live in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. **Clue 5:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. **Clue 6:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the person who lives in the second house (Clue 2). This person is the mystery book reader.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: ?

Next, we use Clue 3 and Clue 6 to place the bird keeper and the fish enthusiast. The bird keeper cannot be in House 1 or House 3, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in House 3, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the history book buff. The history book buff must be directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the history book buff is in House 1, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 5 to place the percussionist. The percussionist must be directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the computer must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Next, we use Clue 7 to place the person who has a gameboy. The person who has a gameboy must be directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the gameboy is in House 2, the rose bouquet must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Finally, we use Clue 8 to place the cellist. The cellist cannot be in House 3. Since the cellist is not in House 3, the cellist must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the person who has a gameboy. The gameboy is in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy is directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the rose bouquet is in House 3, the gameboy must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. This means the person driving a truck must live in house 1 because the person driving a truck is the only other car type left.

From Clue 1, since the person driving a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff, and the history book buff cannot be in house 1 (because the person driving a truck is in house 1), the history book buff must be in house 2. Therefore, the person driving a convertible must be in house 1.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Person driving a convertible (wearing sandals)
- House 2: Person wearing boots (history book buff)

This leaves the person in house 2 to be the mystery book reader, and the person in house 1 to be the person who drives a truck (not wearing boots).

Thus, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer must live in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing loafers.
4. **Clue 4:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover.

From Clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

Now, let's analyze the remaining clues:

- **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels cannot be in the second or fourth house. Therefore, they must be in the first or third house. Since the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
- **Clue 4:** The person wearing high heels cannot be in the fourth house. This is consistent with our previous deduction.
- **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing loafers. This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the person wearing loafers cannot be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses.

Given these constraints, let's place the remaining people:

- The first house is occupied by the person wearing high heels.
- The third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.
- The fourth house is occupied by the person wearing loafers.
- The second house must be occupied by the person wearing sandals, and the romance book lover must be in the fourth house (since the person wearing sandals is in the second house and the romance book lover must be directly left of the person wearing sandals).

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person wearing high heels
- Second house: Person wearing sandals
- Third house: Mystery book reader
- Fourth house: Person wearing loafers

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as positions 1, 2, and 3 from left to right. We need to determine the arrangement of the person who likes yellow, the person who has a gameboy, the person who has a computer, and the person who likes green.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Clue 3** tells us that the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in either house 1 or house 3.

#### Case 1: The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

#### Case 2: The person who likes yellow is in house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
2. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
6. The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are in the same house, which contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, Clue 5 must be incorrect, and the root beer lover does not live in the third house. This means the root beer lover must live in one of the other houses.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. So, the tea drinker must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.

Let's summarize the information we have so far:
- The third house is occupied by the root beer lover.
- The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
- The tea drinker is not in the second house.

Let's place the people based on the clues:

1. The root beer lover is in the third house.
2. The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
3. The tea drinker is not in the second house.

If the tea drinker is in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house numbers step by step:

1. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (House 1).**
2. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house (House 1), so the fish enthusiast must live in House 2.**
3. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house (House 1), so the person who had pizza must live in House 2.**
4. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.** Since the fish enthusiast (who likes green) lives in House 2, the person who has a radio must live in House 1.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who had pizza (in House 2) and the person who likes green (in House 2) are already determined, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in House 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in House 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in House 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in House 1 (since the fish enthusiast is in House 2).

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct arrangement of people, pets, books, lunch, favorite colors, and drinks. Let's break down the clues and use them to narrow down the possibilities.

1. **Dog owner** lives in the second house.
2. **Stew** does not live in the third, fourth, or fifth house (from clue 18).
3. **Milk** and **blue** are directly left and right of each other. Since **dog owner** is in the second house, **milk** and **blue** cannot be in the first or second house. Therefore, **milk** must be in the first house and **blue** in the third house.
4. **Bird keeper** and **history book buff** are directly left and right of each other. Since **bird keeper** cannot be in the first house (from clue 3), and **history book buff** cannot be in the third house (from clue 3), **bird keeper** must be in the first house and **history book buff** in the second house.
5. **Spaghetti** lives somewhere to the left of **red**. Since **red** cannot be in the first or second house (from clue 5), **spaghetti** must be in the first house and **red** in the fourth house.

13. **Yellow** lives somewhere to the left of the **romance book lover**. Since **romance book lover** is in the second house, **yellow** must be in the first house.
14. **Tea** lives directly left of the **white**. Since **tea** is already in the first house, **white** must be in the second house.

### Final Arrangement

- **House 2**: White, Romance book lover, Root beer
- **House 3**: Science fiction book fanatic, Pizza, Fish enthusiast
- **House 4**: Fantasy book enthusiast, Horses, Spaghetti

From the final arrangement, we can see that the person who only drinks water lives in the **first house**.

Thus, the answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The flutist lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
9. **Clue 10:** The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
11. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
12. **Clue 13:** The cat lover lives in the first house.

From Clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, we can write:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 1, 3, or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 5, the flutist lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis.

From Clue 6, the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 7, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2 or 4.

From Clue 13, the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis, the cat lover must be the person eating kiwis, which contradicts Clue 13. Therefore, the cat lover must be in a different house.

Let's summarize the constraints:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis
- House 2: Person drinking water
- House 3: Person drinking milk
- House 4: Person drinking root beer

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2 or 4.

Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2. The person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who likes milk must live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 4.

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

Thus, the correct answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner lives in house \(X\), the tulip owner lives in house \(X-1\).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - This means the daffodils owner cannot live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - This means if the horse owner lives in house \(X\), the carnations owner lives in house \(X+1\) or \(X-1\).

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if the horse owner lives in house \(X\), the lilies owner lives in house \(X+1\) or higher.

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the cat lover lives in house 1.

Given the cat lover lives in house 1, we can start filling in the houses:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Daffodils (from Clue 2)
- House 3: Horse (from Clue 4, since the lilies owner must be to the right of the horse owner)
- House 4: Dog (from Clue 1, since the tulip owner must be to the left of the dog owner)
- House 5: Fish (remaining pet)

Now, let's verify the remaining clues:

- **Clue 1:** The tulip owner lives in house 4, and the dog owner lives in house 5.
- **Clue 2:** The daffodils owner lives in house 2.
- **Clue 3:** The horse owner lives in house 3, and the carnations owner lives in house 4 (which is consistent with the dog owner living in house 5).
- **Clue 4:** The lilies owner lives in house 4 (which is consistent with the dog owner living in house 5).
- **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in house 1.

Thus, the fish enthusiast must live in house 5.

However, since the options provided are (A) 2, (B) 3, (C) 1, (D) 4, and house 5 is not an option, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or a typo in the options. Based on the given clues and logical deductions, the correct answer should be house 5.

Given the options, the closest correct answer is:

\(\boxed{5}\) (though this is not an option, the correct deduction leads to house 5)."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. The person with a phone lives in the first house (Clue 1).
   - Therefore, the person in house 1 has a phone.

2. The person wearing boots does not live in the second house (Clue 2).
   - Hence, the person in house 2 does not wear boots.

3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other (Clue 3).
   - This means either the person in house 1 owns horses and has a radio, or the person in house 2 owns horses and has a radio.

Since the person in house 1 has a phone (Clue 1), the person in house 2 must be wearing boots (Clue 2). Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

Given that the person in house 1 owns horses (since they cannot have a radio, as the person in house 2 would then have a radio and be next to the person with horses), the person in house 2 must have a radio.

Thus, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Grilled Cheese and Computer**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
2. **Grilled Cheese in Third House**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
3. **Apples in First House**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the first house.
4. **Apples and Boots**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the first house, and the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
5. **Blue and Phone**: There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives.
6. **Loafers and Computer**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house, and the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
7. **Pizza in Second House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.
8. **Mangos and Yellow**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
9. **Computer and Phone**: The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
10. **Grilled Cheese and Computer**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.

Let's start by placing the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer. Since the grilled cheese person cannot be in the third house, and they must be next to each other, the only possible arrangement is:
- Grilled Cheese in the second house, Computer in the first house.

Now, the person who likes blue must be in the first house (since there is one house between the person who likes blue and the person who has a phone, and the first house is occupied by the person who likes blue).

So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: Person who likes blue
- Second house: Grilled Cheese
- Third house: Person who has a computer

Since the person who likes blue is in the first house, the person who has a phone must be in the third house.

Next, the person who is eating apples cannot be in the first house, and they must be to the right of the person who is wearing boots. The only possible arrangement for the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing boots is:
- Apples in the third house, Boots in the first house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: Person who is wearing boots
- Second house: Grilled Cheese
- Third house: Person who is eating apples

Now, the person who is eating mangos must be directly left of the person who likes yellow. The only possible arrangement for the person who is eating mangos and the person who likes yellow is:
- Mangos in the second house, Yellow in the third house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: Person who is wearing boots
- Second house: Person who is eating mangos
- Third house: Person who is eating apples

This leaves the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a phone. Since the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the third house, and they must be next to the person who has a computer, the only possible arrangement is:
- Loafers in the first house, Phone in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who is wearing loafers
- Second house: Person who is eating mangos
- Third house: Person who is eating apples

Therefore, the person who likes green must live in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."

5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Step 1: Identify the baseball player
From clue 3, we know the baseball player lives in the second house. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

#### Step 2: Identify the basketball player
From clue 1, the basketball player does not live in the first house. From clue 2, the basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Therefore, the basketball player must be in either House 1 or House 2. Since the baseball player is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

#### Step 3: Identify the swimmer
From clue 2, the basketball player (House 1) lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the basketball player is in House 1, the swimmer must be in House 2 or House 3. But since the baseball player is already in House 2, the swimmer must be in House 3. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

#### Step 4: Identify the tennis player and cat lover
From clue 6, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the baseball player is in House 2 and the swimmer is in House 3, the tennis player must be in House 3 and the cat lover must be in House 4. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cat lover

#### Step 5: Identify the fish enthusiast and bird keeper
From clue 4, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 4, the dog owner must be in House 3. So, the fish enthusiast must be in House 4. This leaves the bird keeper to be in House 1. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Bird keeper
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cat lover

### Conclusion:
The bird keeper lives in House 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **White and Computer:**
   - The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - This means the computer owner cannot be in the first house, and the white lover cannot be in the first house either.

2. **Baseball Player and Blue:**
   - There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
   - This means the baseball player and the person who likes blue must be in houses 2 and 3, with the baseball player in house 2 and the person who likes blue in house 3.

3. **Sedan and SUV:**
   - The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the sedan owner and the SUV owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Sedan and Gameboy:**
   - The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
   - This means the sedan owner and the gameboy owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

5. **Violinist and First House:**
   - The violinist does not live in the first house.
   - This means the violinist must live in either house 2 or 3.

6. **Guitarist and White:**
   - The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means the guitarist must live in a house to the right of the white lover.

### Combining Clues

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

From clue 1, we know:
- The computer owner cannot be in house 1, and the white lover cannot be in house 1.

From clue 3, we know:
- The sedan and SUV owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 4, we know:
- The sedan and gameboy owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 5, we know:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1.

From clue 6, we know:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the white lover.

### Deduction

Let's place the known elements:

- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

Now, let's place the sedan and SUV:
- If the sedan is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (but house 2 is already taken by the baseball player).
- Therefore, the sedan must be in house 2, and the SUV must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

Now, we need to place the violinist and the white lover:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3.
- The white lover must be in house 1 or 3.

Since the white lover cannot be in house 1 (because the computer owner is there), the white lover must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 2 for the sedan owner.

Now, we need to place the guitarist and the gameboy:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the white lover (house 3), so the guitarist must be in house 3.
- The gameboy must be next to the sedan owner (house 2).

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

### Final Arrangement

- House 1: Computer owner
- House 2: Sedan owner
- House 3: Person who likes blue

The remaining characteristics:
- The white lover is in house 3.
- The guitar is in house 3.
- The gameboy is in house 2.
- The violinist is in house 2.
- The baseball player is in house 2.
- The soccer player is in house 1.

Thus, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

2. **Person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.**
3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other. Since the person eating oranges is directly left of the person with a television, and the person eating kiwis is to the left of the person wearing boots, we can deduce the following:

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist next to each other. The only remaining house for the percussionist is house 3, and the only remaining house for the person wearing running shoes is house 4. However, house 4 is already occupied by the person eating oranges. Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, we need to place the person with a radio and the person wearing high heels next to each other. The only remaining house for the person with a radio is house 7, and the only remaining house for the person wearing high heels is house 2.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

And the person with a television must be in house 8.

Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The correct answer is (A) 8."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses.

1. **The tea drinker does not live in the first house.**
2. **The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.**
3. **The person who likes red does not live in the third house.**
4. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.**
5. **The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.**
6. **There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.**
7. **The person who likes milk lives in the third house.**
8. **The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.**

12. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
13. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.**

From Clue 7, we know the person who likes milk lives in the third house. Let's denote this as:

- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 2, the person who is eating apples also lives in the third house. This contradicts Clue 7, so we need to re-evaluate. Let's assume the person who is eating apples lives in a different house, say House 2 or House 4 or House 5.

Let's assume the person who is eating apples lives in House 2:

- House 2: Person who is eating apples

Now, Clue 1 tells us the tea drinker does not live in House 1. Let's place the tea drinker in House 4 or House 5.

Let's place the tea drinker in House 4:

- House 4: Tea drinker

Now, Clue 3 tells us the person who likes red does not live in House 3. Let's place the person who likes red in House 1 or House 5.

Let's place the person who likes red in House 1:

- House 1: Person who likes red

Now, Clue 4 tells us the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the milk drinker is in House 3 and the person who is eating apples is in House 2, the person who is eating a banana must be in House 3. This contradicts Clue 7, so we need to re-evaluate. Let's place the person who is eating a banana in House 5:

- House 5: Person who is eating a banana

Now, Clue 5 tells us the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Let's place the person who only drinks water in House 2 and the person who likes yellow in House 3:

- House 2: Person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who likes yellow

Now, Clue 6 tells us there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Let's place the person who is eating kiwis in House 1 and the root beer lover in House 5:

- House 1: Person who is eating kiwis
- House 5: Person who likes root beer

Now, Clue 8 tells us the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the milk drinker is in House 3, the person who owns an SUV must be in House 4 or House 5. Since the person who likes root beer is in House 5, the person who owns an SUV must be in House 4:

- House 4: Person who owns an SUV

Now, Clue 9 tells us the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes red is in House 1 and the person who only drinks water is in House 2, this is satisfied.

Now, Clue 10 tells us the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red is in House 1, the person who drives a convertible must be in House 2:

- House 2: Person who drives a convertible

Now, Clue 11 tells us the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who likes blue is in House 2 and the person who drives a truck is in House 3, this is satisfied.

Now, Clue 12 tells us the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who is eating mangos is in House 2 and the person who likes green is in House 3, this is satisfied.

Finally, Clue 13 tells us the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow is in House 3 and the person who owns a sedan is in House 4, this is satisfied.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

- The person eating a banana does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person eating a banana must live in the third house.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
- The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
- Therefore, the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

This leaves the first house for the person who owns an SUV.

Thus, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

11. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.
    - Possible positions for SUV: (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

### Deductions

Given the constraints, let's place the known elements:

- House 5: Blue
- House 4: White
- House 1: SUV (since it cannot be in the first house)
- House 2: Running shoes (since it cannot be in the first house and there are two houses between sedan and running shoes)
- House 3: Green (since it cannot be in the first house and there is one house between green and truck)

Now, we need to place the truck and sandals:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Since the truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in a house to the right of the truck, we can place:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Finally, we need to place the truck and sandals:

- House 3: Green

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the history book buff:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house.
2. There is one house between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. Since the history book buff is in the first house, the person who had stew must be in either the second or the third house.
3. There is one house between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who had stew lives. This means the person who had pizza cannot be in the first house (since the history book buff is there) and must be in the second or third house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the history book buff is in house 1. From clue 2, the person who had stew cannot be in house 2 (since the fantasy book enthusiast is there), so they must be in house 3. From clue 3, the person who had pizza must be in house 2. This leaves house 3 for the person who had stew.

Therefore, the history book buff lives in house number 1.

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."

   - Since the pizza eater is in house 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

8. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the person who likes milk must be in a house to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.

9. **Clue 4:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2 or 3. But since the saxophonist is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

10. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
    - Since the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 2. This means the person who likes milk must be in house 3 or 4. But since the pizza eater is in house 3, the person who likes milk must be in house 4.

11. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the minivan driver lives in house 4. From Clue 10, the root beer lover lives in house 3. From Clue 8, the basketball player lives directly left of the truck driver, so the truck driver must be in house 2 and the basketball player in house 1.

From Clue 3, the swimmer lives directly left of the sedan owner. Since the swimmer is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the truck driver. This means the sedan owner must be in house 3, and the swimmer in house 1.

From Clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other. Since the sedan owner (house 3) and the swimmer (house 1) are already occupied, the daffodils and lilies must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the sedan owner is in house 3, the daffodils must be in house 2, and the lilies in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3) lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (house 1). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From Clue 6, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the tennis player is in house 2 and the tea drinker must be to the right, the tea drinker must be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person who drives a truck (house 2) lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the truck driver is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.

From Clue 7, the swimmer (house 1) does not live in the first house, which is consistent with the arrangement.

Thus, the truck driver lives in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(D) 2**."
"To solve this, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house (Clue 1).
2. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person driving a minivan (Clue 2).
3. The person driving a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 3).
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives (Clue 4).
5. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house (Clue 5).

From Clue 1, we know the tea drinker is in house 1. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3.

- Since the person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person driving a minivan, the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.
- The person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's test the possible positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1 (Clue 5), then the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the placement of each person:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.
   - This directly tells us that the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

2. **Clue 2**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - If the SUV owner is in house 3, the person in house 2 must be the mystery book reader, and the person in house 1 must be the person who drives a convertible.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - Since the SUV owner is in house 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 2. But house 1 is already taken by the person who drives a convertible, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - The person who drives a convertible is in house 1, so the person who is eating mangos must be in house 2.

5. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - The person who drives a minivan must be in house 2 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible), and the dog owner must be in house 3.

6. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
   - The person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible, house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, and house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV). The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 4. Since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, the bird keeper must be in house 4.

7. **Clue 8**: The bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The bird keeper is in house 4, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. But house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to recheck the placement.

8. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - The person who drives a minivan is in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, the history book buff must be in house 1.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1 (since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos), and the romance book lover must be in house 4.

10. **Clue 11**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
    - The person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 3, and the person who is eating grapes must be in house 4.

Given all these clues, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Person who drives a convertible

3. **Clue 3**: The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the tea drinker must live in house 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - Since the tea drinker lives in house 3, the television must be in house 2 (which is a contradiction since house 2 already has the rose bouquet).
   - Therefore, the television must be in house 1, and the guitarist must be in house 2.

5. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives.
   - If the flutist lives in house 1, the person eating a banana must live in house 3.
   - If the flutist lives in house 2, the person eating a banana must live in house 1.
   - If the flutist lives in house 3, the person eating a banana must live in house 2 (which is a contradiction since house 2 already has the rose bouquet).

6. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in house 3, the person with a radio must be in house 1.
   - If the person with a vase of tulips is in house 2, the person with a radio must be in house 1.

7. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the coffee drinker must be in a house with a lower number than the person eating kiwis.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Person with a radio, eating bananas, and having a vase of tulips.
- House 2: Person with a rose bouquet, guitarist, and having a television.
- House 3: Person with a television, coffee drinker, and eating kiwis.

The root beer lover must live in house 1, as that is the only house left.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 1. The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 7**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast.

2. **Clue 6**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.
   - This means the person eating apples and the person wearing boots must be in houses 2 and 4 or 1 and 3.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the person eating apples must live in either the first or the fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the mangos and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the apples and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 2**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in either the fourth house or the fifth house (but since there are only 4 houses, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth house).

7. **Clue 1**: The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the history book buff must live in the second house.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the person eating a banana must live in either the fourth or the fifth house. But since there are only 4 houses, the person eating a banana must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Second house: History book buff
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic (from Clue 2 and Clue 6)
- First house: Person eating mangos (from Clue 5 and Clue 3)
- Fourth house: Person eating a banana (from Clue 8)
- Fifth house: Person eating apples (from Clue 4 and Clue 3)

Since the person eating apples must live in either the first or the fourth house, and the fourth house is already occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the person eating apples must live in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person eating mangos
- Second house: History book buff
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic
- Fifth house: Person eating a banana

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their house numbers step by step:

1. **Fried Rice and Spaghetti**:
   - The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house (number 1).
   - Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house (number 2).

2. **SUV and Car**:
   - The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house (number 2).
   - Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house (number 1).

3. **Flutist and White**:
   - The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - Since the flutist lives in the first house (number 1), the person who likes white must live in the second house (number 2).

4. **Loafers and White**:
   - The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - Since the person who likes white lives in the second house (number 2), the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house (number 1).

From the above deductions:
- The person in the first house (number 1) is the flutist and is wearing loafers.
- The person in the second house (number 2) is the person who likes white and is wearing sandals.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is **2**."

But house 3 is occupied by the root beer lover, so the sedan owner must be in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the person who is eating apples must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, so this is a contradiction. Let's recheck the sedan owner and the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 6, the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. This means the cellist and saxophonist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the cellist must be in house 1, and the saxophonist must be in house 2.

From Clue 9, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who is eating apples is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement

- House 3: Root beer lover

The violinist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

The answer is (E) 5."

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

   - This means G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D.

Given Clue 1, SFF is in House 1 and Golfer is in House 2. Since PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses and SFF is in House 1, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2. However, since Golfer is in House 2, PE and HBB cannot both be in House 2. Therefore, PE must be in House 1 and HBB must be in House 2.

Now, considering Clue 3, G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D. Since Golfer is in House 2, G must be in House 2 and D must be in House 1. This contradicts the arrangement of PE and HBB, so we need to reassess.

Given the constraints, the only feasible arrangement is:
- House 1: SFF (science fiction book fanatic), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- House 2: PE (pizza-eater), Golfer (Golfer), HBB (history book buff)

Since the percussionist (Perc) is not mentioned in any of the clues and must be in one of the houses, and considering the arrangement, the percussionist must be in House 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"

"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.

From Clue 3, we know that the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. Let's denote the houses as follows:
- House 1: Lilies
- House 2: Unknown

From Clue 4, the basketball player cannot live in house 1. Therefore, the basketball player must live in house 2.

Now, let's consider Clue 1 and Clue 2 together. Since the person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist, the person eating apples must be to the left of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must live in house 1, and the violinist must live in house 2.

To summarize:
- House 1: Lilies (person with the bouquet of lilies)
- House 2: Unknown (person eating apples, violinist, or basketball player)

Since the basketball player cannot be in house 1, and the violinist must be in house 2, the violinist must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to match each person with their sport and lunch, and then determine the house number where the cricketer lives. Let's break down the clues and use logical deduction to find the solution.

### Clues Recap:
1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Tennis Player (3rd house):**
   - The tennis player lives in the 3rd house.

2. **Grilled Cheese (5th house):**
   - The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the 5th house.

3. **Golfer (4th house):**
   - The golfer lives in the 4th house.

4. **Stew and Spaghetti (1 house between them):**
   - Let's denote the person who had stew as \( S \) and the person who ate spaghetti as \( Sp \).
   - Since there is one house between \( S \) and \( Sp \), the possible positions for \( S \) and \( Sp \) are:
     - \( S \) in the 2nd house and \( Sp \) in the 4th house (but the 4th house is occupied by the golfer).
     - \( S \) in the 1st house and \( Sp \) in the 3rd house.
     - \( S \) in the 3rd house and \( Sp \) in the 5th house (but the 5th house is occupied by grilled cheese).
     - \( S \) in the 2nd house and \( Sp \) in the 5th house (but the 5th house is occupied by grilled cheese).
     - \( S \) in the 1st house and \( Sp \) in the 4th house (but the 4th house is occupied by the golfer).
     - \( S \) in the 1st house and \( Sp \) in the 2nd house.
   - The only valid positions are \( S \) in the 1st house and \( Sp \) in the 3rd house.

5. **Stew (1st house) and Spaghetti (3rd house):**
   - Stew lives in the 1st house.
   - Spaghetti lives in the 3rd house.

6. **Person who had pizza (left of cricketer):**
   - The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.

7. **Tennis player (3rd house) and Soccer player (left of tennis player):**
   - The tennis player lives in the 3rd house.
   - The soccer player must live to the left of the tennis player, so the soccer player could be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd house. Since the 3rd house is occupied by the tennis player, the soccer player must be in the 1st or 2nd house.

8. **Remaining positions:**
   - The remaining houses are 2, 4, and 5.
   - The golfer is in the 4th house.
   - The grilled cheese is in the 5th house.
   - The cricketer must live in the 2nd or 5th house, but the 5th house is occupied by grilled cheese.

9. **Final positions:**
   - Stew (1st house)
   - Cricketer (2nd house)
   - Soccer player (1st house, but it's already occupied by stew)
   - Tennis player (3rd house)
   - Golf (4th house)
   - Pizza (2nd house, left of cricketer)
   - Spaghetti (3rd house)

Thus, the cricketer lives in the 2nd house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding houses step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house (house 2).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who likes white must live in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1.

From the above deductions:
- **House 1:** Person who only drinks water, Person who likes white, Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2).
- **House 2:** Person who only drinks water (lives in house 1), Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2), Person who likes red, Person who plays baseball (lives in house 1), Person who wears loafers (lives in house 2).

Since the person who wears loafers lives in house 2, the correct answer is:

**(A) 2**"
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as A, B, and C, corresponding to the houses 1, 2, and 3 respectively. We will use the clues to deduce the positions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either house 1 or house 3.

**Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the person eating oranges must live in either house 1 or house 3.

**Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. If the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.

**Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means if the coffee drinker is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 3. If the coffee drinker is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 3).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 2).

This configuration does not work because the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2.

- If the root beer lover is in house 3:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the placement of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Now, we know:
- House 1: Spaghetti eater
- House 2: Boots wearer
- House 3: Fried rice eater

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

The answer is (C) 4."
"Given the clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The tennis player does not live in the first house.

From the first clue, we know the mystery book reader is in house 1. From the second clue, the tennis player is in house 2.

Since there are only two houses and two people, and we have already assigned the mystery book reader to house 1 and the tennis player to house 2, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is:

(B) 2"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses. We'll start by analyzing the constraints and placing the people step by step.

1. **Person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
2. **Person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.**
3. **There are two houses between where the person who likes green lives and where the pianist lives.**
4. **Person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.**
5. **Person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.**
6. **Person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.**
7. **Person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist.**
8. **Person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house.**
9. **Person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.**
10. **Person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.**
11. **Person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.**
12. **Person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.**
13. **Person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.**

Let's start by placing the person who likes white and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in the fourth house (loafers), the possible positions for the person who likes white are houses 2, 3, or 4. However, since the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, the person who likes white must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3.

Now, let's place the person who likes green and the pianist. Since there are two houses between where the person who likes green lives and where the pianist lives, and the pianist cannot be in the first house, the possible positions for the pianist are houses 2 or 3. Since the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the pianist must be in house 3.

Next, we place the person who has a bouquet of lilies and the guitarist. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist, so the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in house 2, and the guitarist must be in house 3.

Now, we place the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other, and the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 3, the person who had pizza must be in house 2, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4.

Finally, we place the person who likes blue and the violinist. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, and the person who likes blue cannot be in house 1 (green) or house 3 (pianist). The person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the violinist must be in house 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who likes blue
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 4: Person who likes white

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in **house 4**.

Since the person in House 1 is not the dog owner, the bird keeper must be in House 1 and the person wearing high heels must be in House 2.

5. **Clue 3:** The tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
   - House 1: Tennis player or eating apples
   - House 2: Tennis player or eating apples

   - House 2: Dog owner, eating apples

Now we have:

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is the bird keeper and eating kiwis.
- The person in House 2 is the dog owner and eating apples.
- The tennis player and the person eating apples live next to each other in House 1, so the tennis player must be in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
   - This implies the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - Since the baseball player lives in the second house, and the person eating grapes also lives in the second house, it follows that the person eating grapes is the baseball player.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - Since the person eating grapes (the baseball player) lives in the second house, the person driving a convertible must also live in the second house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person eating grapes (the baseball player) lives in the second house.
- The person driving a convertible lives in the second house.
- The person eating mangos must live in the first house (since the person eating grapes lives in the second house and the person driving a convertible lives in the second house).

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house. This means the person who likes blue is in house 2.
2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.
3. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. This means the person who is eating apples is in house 1 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3.
4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green is in house 1 (because the person who likes blue is in house 2 and the person who likes white must be in house 3), the person who likes white must be in house 3.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 3 (but there is no house 3, so this is not possible).

2. **Clue 2**: The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the soccer player and the mystery book reader must be in adjacent houses, with the soccer player in house 1 and the mystery book reader in house 2, or vice versa.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the person with the gameboy must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person with the gameboy is in house 1.
- The mystery book reader is in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player is in house 1 (since the mystery book reader is in house 2).

From Clue 1, we know:
- The root beer lover must be in house 2 (since the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the root beer lover is to the right of the person with the rose bouquet).

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know the fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be in adjacent houses. This means they can be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

From Clue 2, there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner. This means the truck and the dog owner cannot be in houses 1 and 2, as there would not be enough space for two houses between them. Therefore, the dog owner must be in houses 3 or 4, and the truck must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 3, the truck and the sedan must be in adjacent houses. This means if the truck is in house 1, the sedan must be in house 2, and if the truck is in house 2, the sedan must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the cat lover cannot be in house 2. This means the cat lover must be in house 1, 3, or 4.

Let's test the possible positions for the dog owner and the truck:

- **Dog owner in house 3:**
  - Truck must be in house 1 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
  - This leaves house 2 for the fish enthusiast and house 4 for the sedan.
  - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

  This configuration works:
  - House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
  - House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
  - House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
  - House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

- **Dog owner in house 4:**
  - Truck must be in house 2 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
  - This leaves house 1 for the cat lover and house 3 for the sedan.
  - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 2 and the dog owner is in house 4).

  This configuration does not work because the cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 5).

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:
- House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
- House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
- House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.
2. **Clue 4**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water.
3. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover lives in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer.
4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3.
5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3.

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Only drinks water (W)
- House 2: Likes root beer (R)
- House 3: Likes yellow (Y)
- House 4: Likes blue (B) or likes milk (M)

Since the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3, and the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3, the only possible house for the person who likes blue is House 4.

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer

Next, Clue 5:
- The person wearing sandals must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer).

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Unknown
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals

Now, Clue 4:
- The dog owner must be in house 1 (since house 1 is taken by the unknown person and house 3 is taken by the cricketer and the person wearing sandals).

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals

Next, Clue 2:
- The baseball player must be in house 1 (since house 1 is taken by the dog owner).

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Dog owner, Baseball player
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals

Now, Clue 3:
- The person eating grapes must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer, person wearing sandals, and person eating grapes).

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Dog owner, Baseball player
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals, Person eating grapes

Finally, Clue 7:
- The person wearing loafers must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer, person wearing sandals, and person eating grapes).

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Dog owner, Baseball player
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals, Person eating grapes, Person wearing loafers

The person who likes white (the only color left) must be the bird keeper, and since the bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (as house 1 is taken by the dog owner and baseball player), the bird keeper must be in house 3.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

"Given the clues, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the cellist and the person with the gameboy are neighbors, and the cellist is to the left of the person with the gameboy.

2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   - This means the dog owner must live in the second house.

Let's consider the possible positions for the cellist and the person with the gameboy:

- If the cellist is in house 1, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 2.
- If the cellist is in house 2, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 1.

However, the dog owner cannot be in house 1, so the only possible arrangement is:
- Cellist in house 1
- Gameboy owner in house 2

This leaves house 1 for the dog owner.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **1**."

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

From the above, we know:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be adjacent to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, the only possible arrangement for the phone and SUV is:
- House 2: Phone
- House 4: SUV

Thus, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

Since the computer is in house 2, the adjacent houses for the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement are houses 1 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since house 3 already has tulips, the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 3.

1. **Root Beer Lover and Water Drinkers**: The root beer lover does not live in house 1, so they must live in house 2.
2. **Grapes and Computer**: The person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with the computer. Since the root beer lover is in house 2, the person with the computer must be in house 1 and the person eating grapes must be in house 2.
3. **Radio and Truck**: The person with the radio and the person driving the truck live next to each other.
4. **Radio and Pizza**: The person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the milk drinker and the spaghetti eater cannot be in adjacent houses.

3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the yellow liker cannot be in adjacent houses.

4. The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the white liker and the water drinker must be in adjacent houses.

5. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the tea drinker (House 1) and the pizza eater (House 2) are adjacent.

6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the spaghetti eater and the water drinker cannot be in adjacent houses.

   - The green liker cannot be in House 1.

8. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

- House 4: Grilled cheese eater (adjacent to the pizza eater)

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The green liker cannot be in House 4 (since the grilled cheese eater is there).
- The green liker cannot be in House 2 (since the pizza eater is there).
- The green liker must be in House 3.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the fourth house, and the fish enthusiast must live in the first house.

From Clue 1, the person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house, so they must live in the first house. This contradicts Clue 13, so the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

From Clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner, and since the dog owner is in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must live in the second house.

From Clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house, so they must live in the second house, which is consistent with Clue 10.

From Clue 11, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers. Since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house, which is consistent with Clue 8.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. Since the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, the person who likes red must live in the second house.

From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. Since the person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house, the root beer lover and the coffee drinker must be in the first and third houses. The fish enthusiast lives in the first house, so the root beer lover must live in the third house, and the coffee drinker must live in the first house.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing sandals must live in the third house, the person who drives a minivan must live in the second house, which is consistent with Clue 10.

Thus, the person who likes red lives in the second house.

### Conclusion:
The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in **House 1**.

Thus, the answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the golfer and the basketball player are adjacent, and the golfer is to the left of the basketball player.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person with lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese are adjacent, and the person with lilies is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

3. **Clue 3:** The soccer player lives in the third house.
   - This means the soccer player lives in house number 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in a house number less than the house number where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person with tulips does not live in house number 3.

From Clue 3, we know the soccer player lives in house number 3. From Clue 1, the golfer and the basketball player must be in houses 1 and 2, with the golfer to the left of the basketball player. From Clue 2, the person with lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in houses 1 and 2, with the person with lilies to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Therefore, the person with lilies must be in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the person who ate spaghetti. The person with tulips cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or house 2. Since the person with lilies is in house 1, the person with tulips must be in house 2. However, house 2 is already occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese, so the person with tulips must be in house 4.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with lilies
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. **Clue 8:** There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
8. **Clue 10:** The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 11:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
10. **Clue 12:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 2 and Clue 7, we know the third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice and the person who likes red. Since Clue 9 states the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house, Clue 7 is consistent with this. Therefore, the third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.

From Clue 4, the person who had stew must be in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house. This is because the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 5, the person who likes green cannot be in the fourth house, so the fourth house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 8, there are two houses between the person who likes yellow and the person who likes white. Since the person who likes yellow is in the fourth house, the person who likes white must be in the sixth house (since the fourth and sixth houses are two houses apart).

From Clue 10, the percussionist and the cellist must live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 5) and the person who likes yellow is in the fourth house, the person who likes green must be in the first house. The person who likes white is in the sixth house, so the person who likes blue must be in the fifth house.

Now, the only house left is the first house, which must be occupied by the person who likes blue.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes blue
- Second house: Person who had stew
- Third house: Person who ate fried rice
- Fourth house: Person who likes yellow
- Fifth house: Person who likes blue (already occupied)
- Sixth house: Person who likes white

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. The tea drinker lives in house 3.
2. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in house 3.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 2, the person who had stew must be in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 1, the only possible positions for the grilled cheese eater are houses 2 or 3. However, house 3 is already occupied by the tea drinker, so the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in house 2, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Since the grilled cheese eater is in house 2, the only possible positions for the high heels wearer and the person who only drinks water are houses 1 and 2. However, house 1 is already occupied by the person who is wearing running shoes, so the high heels wearer and the person who only drinks water must be in houses 2 and 3. But house 3 is already occupied by the tea drinker, so this is not possible. Therefore, the high heels wearer and the person who only drinks water must be in houses 2 and 4.

This leaves house 4 for the person who is wearing running shoes.

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this, let's break down the clues and deduce the correct placement of each person and their possessions.

1. **Clue 10**: The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. **Clue 11**: The cricketer lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.

12. **Clue 1**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
13. **Clue 13**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

From Clue 11, we know the cricketer lives in the third house. From Clue 12, the person who is wearing loafers also lives in the third house. From Clue 5, the person who has a radio lives in the third house. From Clue 6, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. From Clue 10, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. From Clue 1, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. From Clue 3, the root beer lover does not live in the first house. From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. From Clue 7, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. From Clue 2, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- First house: root beer lover (since the root beer lover does not live in the first house and the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio, the root beer lover must be in the first house)
- Second house: tea drinker (since the tea drinker must be somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk, and the root beer lover is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the second house)
- First house: root beer lover
- Second house: tea drinker
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk (since the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in the fifth house)
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Sixth house: person who had stew (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the sixth house)
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who had stew
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Seventh house: person who had stew
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, and the third house is occupied by the cricketer, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the eighth house)
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers
- Ninth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Ninth house: person who had stew
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the tenth house)
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese
- Eleventh house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives in the ninth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the eleventh house)
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From the above analysis, the person with the computer lives directly left of the person with the gameboy. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with the radio lives in the third house, and the person with the loafers lives in the third house, the person with the gameboy must be in the second house, and the person with the computer must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This implies that the science fiction book fanatic must be in the left house (house 1), and the person who ate fried rice must be in the right house (house 2).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).
   - Since the person who ate fried rice is in house 2, the person who ate pizza must be in house 1.
   - Therefore, the person who ate pizza is the science fiction book fanatic.

From these deductions, it is clear that the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. The pianist lives in the first house (house 1).
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The pianist lives in house 1.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes white cannot live in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. This means the root beer lover must be in house 2, and the person who owns horses must be in house 1.

Since the person who owns horses is in house 1, and the person who likes white is also in house 1, the person who owns horses is the dog owner (as the only other pet mentioned is horses).

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

3. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fried rice eater and fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

5. **Clue 1**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

6. **Clue 3**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

7. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

Given the constraints, let's place the known elements:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater

Since the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively, and the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, the only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To solve this, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Likes white

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not wearing boots

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not a bird keeper

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils

5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Likes green (since it's directly left of the person wearing running shoes)

6. **Clue 6:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - House 3: Owns horses
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 1: Likes white

7. **Clue 7:** The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Owns horses

8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Owns horses

From Clue 7, we know that the person who owns horses lives in House 3 and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in House 2.

From Clue 5, the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who owns horses (House 3) and the person who has daffodils (House 2) are next to each other, the person who likes green must be in House 1, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3. However, since the person who owns horses is already in House 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Likes white, Wearing sandals
- House 2: Has daffodils, Wearing running shoes
- House 3: Owns horses, Wearing boots

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement is:
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: ?
   - House 3: Person eating apples

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating mangos lives directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Person eating mangos
   - House 3: Person eating apples

3. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:
   - House 1: Coffee drinker
   - House 2: Person eating mangos
   - House 3: Person eating apples

4. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

2. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

3. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the person who only drinks water lives in house number 1. So, we have:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies

From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house number 2. So, we have:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies

Now, we need to place the person who likes milk and the person who has a vase of tulips. From Clue 1, there is one house between the person who only drinks water (house 1) and the person who likes milk. This means the person who likes milk must be in house 3. So, we have:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies
- House 3: Person who likes milk

Now, we need to place the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a rose bouquet. From Clue 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies (in house 2) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 or house 3. But house 1 is already occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who has a rose bouquet
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies
- House 3: Person who likes milk

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
2. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
4. The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
6. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
8. The tennis player lives in the third house.
9. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
10. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
11. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. From clue 1, the person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house. From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. From clue 8, the tennis player lives in the third house, so the person who likes blue also lives in the third house. This means the person who likes green must live in the first house (since the person who likes green cannot live in the third house).

From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who has a radio must live in the second house. Therefore, the person who has a phone lives in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who has a phone does not live in the second house, which is consistent with the person who has a phone living in the first house. From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a phone lives in the first house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the second or third house. Since the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the second house.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the second house. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the first house.

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (house 1).
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover is in house 2 and the history book buff is in house 3.
3. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who likes green must be in house 2. However, house 2 is already occupied by the romance book lover, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to reassess the positions.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house. This means the person who had pizza must live in either house 2 or house 3.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 3.

Given these points, let's re-evaluate:

- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 2) is to the left of the history book buff (in house 3).
- The romance book lover (in house 1) is directly left of the history book buff (in house 3).
- The person who had pizza (in house 3) is to the right of the romance book lover (in house 1).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 1) is in the first house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - This means the tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be in a house to the left of the television.

2. **Clue 2:** The golfer does not live in the second house.
   - This means the golfer cannot be in house number 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
   - This means the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - This means the radio and rose bouquet must be in houses with the radio being to the right of the rose bouquet.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.
   - This means the radio and television must be in houses with the radio being to the right of the television.

Let's start by placing the tennis player and the television based on Clue 1. The tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be to the left of the television. So, the possible pairs are:
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 3
- Tennis player in house 2, television in house 3

### Case 1: Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Television (V) in house 2

Now, the golfer cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3. But since the tennis player is already in house 1, the golfer must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Golfer (G) in house 3

This leaves house 2 for the computer and house 3 for the radio and rose bouquet. Since the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses (Clue 3), and the radio and rose bouquet must be in adjacent houses (Clue 4 and Clue 5), we need to place the computer and tulips in house 2 and the radio and rose bouquet in house 3.

### Checking the placement:
- House 1: Tennis player (T)
- House 2: Computer (C) and Tulips (Tul)
- House 3: Radio (R) and Rose bouquet (Rb)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. Tennis player (T) is to the left of the television (V) in house 1 and house 2.
2. Golfer (G) is in house 3.
3. Computer (C) and tulips (Tul) are in adjacent houses (house 2).
4. Radio (R) and rose bouquet (Rb) are in adjacent houses (house 3).
5. Radio (R) is to the right of the television (V) in house 3.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

11. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
12. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.

### Deductions:
- **Clue 1:** The swimmer lives in the third house.
  - House 3: Swimmer

- **Clue 2:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
  - This means the guitarist cannot live in house 5, and the carnations arrangement cannot live in house 1.

- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
  - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the tulips person is in house X+1.

- **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
  - This means if the running shoes person is in house X, the daffodils person is in house X+1.

- **Clue 5:** The violinist lives in the second house.
  - House 2: Violinist

- **Clue 6:** The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
  - This means if the basketball player is in house X, the guitarist is in house X+1.

- **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
  - This means if the high heels person is in house X, the lilies person is in house X+1.

- **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
  - This means if the loafers person is in house X, the percussionist is in house X+1.

- **Clue 9:** The cricketer lives in the fourth house.

- **Clue 10:** The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
  - This means they must be in houses X and X+1.

- **Clue 11:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
  - House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

- **Clue 12:** There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.
  - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the cellist must be in house X+3 or X-3 (but since houses are numbered 1 to 5, X-3 is not possible).

### Deduction Process:
1. **House 1:** Not possible for violinist, cricketer, or cellist.
2. **House 2:** Violinist.
3. **House 3:** Swimmer.
4. **House 4:** Cricketer.
5. **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils.

Given Clue 11, the daffodils person is in house 5. Clue 12 tells us that the sandals person must be in house 1.

### Final Check:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

The person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the fish enthusiast lives in house 1, and the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
   - This confirms that the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce:
- The person in house 1 is the fish enthusiast.
- The person in house 2 is wearing high heels and ate grilled cheese.

Since the fish enthusiast (in house 1) cannot be the dog owner (as the dog owner must be in house 2), and the person in house 2 (wearing high heels) cannot be the fish enthusiast, the person in house 1 must be the dog owner, and the person in house 2 must be the fish enthusiast (wearing high heels and ate grilled cheese).

This leaves the person in house 1 to have had stew (the only remaining option).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the placement of each person step by step:

2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Romance book lover

3. **Clue 7:** The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fish enthusiast

4. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who has a vase of tulips lives and where the romance book lover lives.
   - Romance book lover is in house 5, so the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 or 6.
   - Since the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 6.
   - House 6: Person with the vase of tulips

5. **Clue 10:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - The bird keeper must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is taken by the person who owns horses.
   - Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 1.
   - House 1: Bird keeper

6. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - The person with the bouquet of lilies is in house 1, so the person who likes yellow must be in house 1.
   - House 1: Person who likes yellow

7. **Clue 9:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in house 1, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.
   - House 2: Person who likes yellow (yellow) and Person who has a bouquet of daffodils

8. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - The fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 4.
   - House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast

9. **Clue 6:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - The dog owner must be in house 5.

10. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
    - The history book buff must be in house 4 (fantasy book enthusiast) or house 1 (bird keeper).
    - Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4, the history book buff must be in house 1.
    - House 1: Bird keeper
    - House 4: Fantasy book enthusiast
    - House 3: Fish enthusiast
    - House 2: Person who likes yellow (yellow) and Person who has a bouquet of daffodils
    - House 5: Dog owner

From the above deductions, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the cat lover lives is **1**."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 2:** The person with a phone lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 4:** The flutist lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 5:** The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots.
4. **Clue 7:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
5. **Clue 11:** There are two houses between where the person wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
6. **Clue 14:** The percussionist lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 2 and Clue 4, we know the third house is occupied by the flutist. Since Clue 5 states the person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots, and Clue 7 states the romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic, we can infer the following:

- The third house is occupied by the flutist.
- The person eating oranges must be in the fourth house (since the flutist is in the third house and oranges must be to the right of boots).
- The person wearing boots must be in the second house (since oranges are to the right of boots).
- The person wearing high heels must be in the first house (since there are two houses between the high heels and the fantasy book enthusiast, and the only remaining house is the first).

This leaves the person eating grapes and the person wearing loafers to be placed in the first and second houses. Since the person wearing loafers cannot be in the first house (Clue 8), the person wearing loafers must be in the second house, and the person eating grapes must be in the first house.

Thus, the person eating oranges lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."

10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

Let's deduce step by step:

- **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house. So, the person who had stew can live in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the person who only drinks water must live in the next house to the right of the person who had stew.
- **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. This means the person who likes white must live in a house to the right of the person who had stew.
- **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza. This means the person who is eating apples must live in a house to the right of the person who had pizza.

From Clue 9 and Clue 10, the person who had stew must live in house 1, and the person who only drinks water must live in house 2. The person who likes white must live in house 4.

From Clue 6, the person who had pizza must live in house 2, and the person who likes yellow must live in house 3.

From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 1, and the person who is eating apples must live in house 4.

Thus, the person who is eating apples lives in house 4.

"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

From Clue 7, the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the saxophonist.

From Clue 6, the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 1, the romance book lover (in the second house) lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the guitarist must be in the third house, and the history book buff must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is occupied by the romance book lover. This means the history book buff must be in the first house.

Thus, the final positions are:
- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Romance book lover
- **House 3:** Saxophonist
- **House 4:** Mystery book reader
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast

The violinist must be in the third house, as the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of the people living in the houses.

### Clues Recap:
1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Clue 1: The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
- House 4: Television

#### Clue 2: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
- House 2: Loafers

#### Clue 3: The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
- House 2: Loafers (already determined)
- House 3: Phone (since the phone cannot be in house 2)

#### Clue 4: The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
- House 2: Loafers
- House 1: Boots (since the boots must be to the left of the loafers)

#### Clue 5: There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television

Let's denote the remaining characteristics:
- Radio
- Gameboy
- Phone
- Sandals

We need to place the remaining characteristics in the remaining houses (houses 1, 2, 3, and 4).

From Clue 5, we know:
- The radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4.
- Since house 2 is already occupied by loafers, the radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3.

Let's consider the possible placements:
- If the radio is in house 1, then the sandals must be in house 3.
- If the radio is in house 3, then the sandals must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Radio in house 1, Sandals in house 3**
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 1: Radio
- House 3: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which contradicts Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

**Scenario 2: Radio in house 3, Sandals in house 1**
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 3: Radio
- House 1: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which is consistent with Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television

The person who has a gameboy lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
   - This directly places the person wearing high heels in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Since the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 2, and we know the high heels person lives in house number 2, the coffee drinker must live in either house number 1 or house number 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes milk must live in either house number 2 or house number 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
   - This is consistent with Clue 2, as the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 3.

Since the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 3, the person who likes milk must be in house number 2 (because the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 2, and the person who likes milk cannot be in house number 1).

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house number 2, and the coffee drinker must live in house number 1.

So, the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - This implies the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
   - Since the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, the mystery book reader cannot live in the second house. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

From this, we can deduce:
- The person wearing loafers lives in the second house.
- The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

The remaining characteristics (history book buff and high heels) must be assigned to the remaining person, which means:
- The history book buff must live in the second house.
- The person wearing high heels must live in the first house.

Thus, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct placement of each person and their belongings.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a gameboy (G) live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (P) lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips (T) lives directly left of the person who had pizza (P).
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a carnations arrangement (C) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) lives directly left of the person who had stew (St).
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a television (Tv) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a rose bouquet (Rb) live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots (B) lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza (P).
10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti (Sp) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).

Let's start by placing the person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S) based on Clue 2 and Clue 9:

- Clue 2: The person who had pizza (P) lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
- Clue 9: The person who is wearing boots (B) lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza (P).

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who had pizza and the person who is wearing sandals.

### Step-by-Step Placement:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S) must be adjacent.
2. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots (B) must be to the left of the person who had pizza (P).

Let's try different placements:

- If P is in house 1, then S must be in house 2 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 2, then B must be in house 1 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P. So, let's try another arrangement:

- If P is in house 2, then S must be in house 3 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 3, then B must be in house 2 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is also not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P.

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is possible. Let's check the other clues with this arrangement:

- **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a gameboy (G) live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips (T) lives directly left of the person who had pizza (P).
- **Clue 5:** The person who has a carnations arrangement (C) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
- **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) lives directly left of the person who had stew (St).
- **Clue 7:** The person who has a television (Tv) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).
- **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a rose bouquet (Rb) live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti (Sp) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).

Let's place the remaining items:

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4.
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (Clue 9).
- If R is in house 2, then G must be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- If T is in house 1, then C must be in house 2 (Clue 4).
- If R is in house 2, then St must be in house 3 (Clue 6).
- If Rb is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 8).
- If Sp is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 10).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person with the rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person with the lilies.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2, or the lilies are in house 1 and the rose bouquet is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the saxophonist must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - This means the person eating mangos lives in house 1.

From Clue 1, we know the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2. This aligns with Clue 2 and Clue 3.

Thus, the person eating apples must live in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses. We'll start by organizing the information step by step.

1. **Clue 15**: The person who has a radio lives in the first house (house 1).
2. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house (house 4).
3. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in house 4, the person with a television must be in house 5.
4. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given the coffee drinker in house 4, the only possible placement for the swimmer and the person who only drinks water is house 3 and house 4, respectively. However, house 4 is already occupied by the coffee drinker, so this is not possible. Thus, the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in houses 2 and 3.
5. **Clue 14**: The basketball player lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water is in house 3, the basketball player must be in house 2.
6. **Clue 13**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. Since the basketball player is in house 2, the person who drives a minivan must be in house 1, and the root beer lover must be in house 2 (but this contradicts the basketball player being in house 2). Thus, the person who drives a minivan must be in house 1, and the root beer lover must be in house 3.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. This is consistent with the previous deductions.
8. **Clue 11**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the fourth house. Since the coffee drinker is in house 4, the person who owns an SUV must be in house 1, 2, or 5.
9. **Clue 8**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in house 4 and the person who likes milk is in house 5, this is consistent.
10. **Clue 6**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the person who likes yellow is in house 4, the cricketer must be in house 5.
11. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the swimmer is in house 3, the person who owns a sedan must be in house 1.
12. **Clue 9**: The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. Since the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who has a computer must be in house 2.
13. **Clue 10**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. Since the person who owns a computer is in house 2, the person who likes red must be in house 1, and the golfer must be in house 3.
14. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house. Since the person who only drinks water is in house 3, this is consistent.
15. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who likes green is in house 3, the person who drives a convertible must be in house 1.
16. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who likes green is in house 3, the person who has a phone must be in house 4.
17. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow is in house 4, the person who likes white must be in house 5.

From the deductions, the coffee drinker lives in house 4, but since house 4 is already occupied by the person who has a phone, the coffee drinker must be in house 5.

Thus, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is **5**.

The correct answer is (C) 5."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the placement of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person with a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. This means the tulip person can only be in houses 1 or 2.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other. This means the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. This means the rose bouquet person can only be in houses 1 or 3.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:
  - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **First house**: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
2. **Fourth house**: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Third house**: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
4. **Second house**: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Given the constraints, the only possible positions for the swimmer and the cricketer are:
- Cricketer in the first house (yellow), and swimmer in the third house (blue).
- Cricketer in the third house (blue), and swimmer in the first house (yellow).

Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the cricketer must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house.

Now, the second house must be occupied by the person who likes white and the person who is eating oranges. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (yellow), and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the first house (yellow). Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.

This leaves the person who owns an SUV in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Green and Yellow**: The person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives directly next to the person who likes green.
   - Therefore, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

2. **Stew and Grilled Cheese**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house.

3. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

4. **Grilled Cheese**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house and the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

5. **Romance Book Lover**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the romance book lover lives in the second house, which is consistent with the previous information.

From the above deductions:
- **First House**: Person who ate grilled cheese
- **Second House**: Person who had stew, romance book lover
- **Third House**: Person who likes green, fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes blue lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- First house: Carnations (person with carnations)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Second house: Vase of tulips and bird keeper
- Fourth house: Rose bouquet and person who likes blue (next to the person who owns horses)
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Second house: Percussionist or cellist
- Third house: Truck (next to the percussionist or cellist)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (number 1).
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. From clue 2, the cellist also lives in house 1. This creates a contradiction because only one person can live in each house. Therefore, we need to reassess the clues.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist cannot both live in the first house, let's consider the possibility that the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1) and the cellist lives in the second house (number 2).

Now, using clue 3: the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the first house (number 1) is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast, the person who likes green must live in the second house (number 2), and the person who likes red must live in the first house (number 1).

This means:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green.
- The person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

Now, we need to determine the mystery book reader. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green and the person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the process of elimination, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses. We'll start by placing the people based on the most specific constraints and then fill in the rest.

1. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer.
2. **Clue 13:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. **Clue 14:** The golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
4. **Clue 15:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
5. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
6. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the golfer and the person eating grapes:
- Since the golfer lives directly left of the person who had pizza, and the person eating grapes lives directly left of the golfer, we can place the golfer in house 1 and the person eating grapes in house 2.

Next, let's place the history book buff and the person who ate fried rice:
- The history book buff lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice, so we can place the history book buff in house 2 and the person who ate fried rice in house 3.

Now, let's place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who is wearing boots:
- The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots, and the person who is wearing boots must be in house 1 or 2. Since the golfer is in house 1, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 3.

Next, let's place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who ate grilled cheese:
- The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 3, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 4.

Finally, let's place the science fiction book fanatic and the person who is eating apples:
- The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating apples must be in house 5. The science fiction book fanatic must be in house 4.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 2: Person eating grilled cheese
- House 3: Person wearing high heels
- House 4: Person eating pizza
- House 5: Person eating apples

The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 3, and the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2. This leaves house 4 for the tennis player, house 5 for the person eating apples, and house 1 for the fantasy book enthusiast.

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 5, and the swimmer must be in house 4.

Therefore, the swimmer lives in house 4.

The correct answer is:
(D) 4"
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. The golfer lives in the second house.
2. The history book buff lives in the first house.
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

From Clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

From Clue 3, the history book buff lives in the first house. This confirms our arrangement:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

Now, considering Clue 1: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives. This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in the first or third house because there would be no house between them and the swimmer. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the swimmer must live in the first house. Thus, the swimmer lives in the first house.

The number of the house where the swimmer lives is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the positions of the people in the houses.

1. **Bird Keeper in House 3**: From clue 8, the bird keeper lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Bird Keeper

   - House 4: Fried Rice Eater
   - House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic

   - House 4: Fried Rice Eater
   - House 1: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
   - House 2: Pizza Eater
   - House 3: History Book Buff
   - House 4: Baseball Player

From the deductions, the person who had stew lives in House 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's break down the information and analyze the clues step by step.

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2, with people living in each. Each person has different characteristics:
- They ate different foods: one ate fried rice and one ate spaghetti.
- They have different pets: one is a cat lover and one owns horses.
- They like different books: one is a history book buff and one is a romance book lover.
- They wear different shoes: one wears sandals and one wears running shoes.

The clues are:
1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's denote the people as follows:
- House 1: Person 1
- House 2: Person 2

### Analyzing Clue 1:
- The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
  - This means if Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals, then Person 2 (House 2) must own horses.
  - If Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals, then Person 1 (House 1) must own horses.

### Analyzing Clue 2:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
  - This means if Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti, then Person 2 (House 2) must be the history book buff.
  - If Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti, then Person 1 (House 1) must be the history book buff.

### Combining Clues:
- From Clue 1, we know that the person wearing sandals and the person owning horses must be adjacent.
- From Clue 2, we know that the history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

### Possible Arrangements:
1. **Person 1 (House 1) owns horses, Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals:**
   - Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the history book buff (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the cat lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the romance book lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing running shoes (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals (Clue 1).

2. **Person 2 (House 2) owns horses, Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals:**
   - Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the history book buff (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the cat lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the romance book lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing running shoes (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals (Clue 1).

### Conclusion:
- In both scenarios, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2.
- Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is **2**.

Final answer: (B) 2"
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This implies that the sedan owner is in house 1 and the person with the bouquet of lilies is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The flutist does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the flutist must live in house 2.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce:
- The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.
- The flutist lives in house 2.
- The person who owns a sedan lives in house 1.

Since the flutist is in house 2, the person who owns a sedan (house 1) must play the saxophone and the person with the bouquet of lilies (house 2) must play the flute.

Thus, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).
4. **Tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the tennis player is in house \(i+1\) or later.
5. **There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet**: This means if the rose bouquet is in house \(i\), the daffodils are in house \(i+1\) or \(i-1\).
6. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\).

### Deductions:
- **House 3**: Rose bouquet.
- **House 2**: Fantasy book enthusiast (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer).
- **House 4**: Tennis player (since the tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader and house 4 is taken by the carnations arrangement, the tennis player must be in house 5, but house 5 is not available, so the tennis player must be in house 4, which is a contradiction, so the tennis player must be in house 5).
- **House 1**: Mystery book reader (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- **House 5**: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

### Final Placement:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player.
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast.

### Conclusion:
The romance book lover must be in house 2, as there are two houses between the mystery book reader (house 1) and the romance book lover.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."

7. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.**
   - Computer in House 5, so cellist must be in House 4.

"To solve this, let's analyze the clues systematically:

1. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means if the minivan driver is in house 2, the person wearing boots must be in house 1.
   - If the minivan driver is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

2. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the person with pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the person with pizza must be in house 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, the person with pizza must be in house 3 (but this is not possible since the person with pizza must be to the right).

3. **The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person wearing running shoes must live in either house 2 or 3.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means if the person with tulips is in house 2, the cricketer must be in house 1.
   - If the person with tulips is in house 3, the cricketer must be in house 2.

5. **The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with pizza must live in either house 1 or 3.

6. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means if the person with grilled cheese is in house 2, the person with sedan must be in house 1.
   - If the person with grilled cheese is in house 3, the person with sedan must be in house 2.

7. **The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person driving a minivan is in house 3.

8. **The golfer lives in the first house.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1.

9. **The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet must live in either house 1 or 3.

Given that the golfer is in house 1, the person with the rose bouquet cannot be in house 1 (since the rose bouquet person cannot be in the second house). Therefore, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's systematically place the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Saxophonist

2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means the person who likes yellow lives in either House 1 or House 2, and the person who likes milk lives in either House 5 or House 4.

3. **Clue 8:** The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
   - Since the saxophonist is in House 3, the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 or House 2.

4. **Clue 12:** There is one house between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes root beer lives.
   - If the person who likes yellow is in House 1, the person who likes root beer must be in House 3 (impossible since the saxophonist is there).
   - If the person who likes yellow is in House 2, the person who likes root beer must be in House 4.

5. **Clue 11:** The person who ate spaghetti and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
   - This means they must be in consecutive houses.

6. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who had pizza must be in consecutive houses.

7. **Clue 10:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the percussionist must be in consecutive houses.

8. **Clue 13:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who likes milk must be in a house to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

9. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - This means the coffee drinker must be in a house to the right of the person who likes red.

10. **Clue 15:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
    - This means the cellist must be in a house to the left of the coffee drinker.

Let's place the people step by step:

- **House 3:** Saxophonist
- **House 2:** Flutist (since the flutist must be in the second house)
- **House 1:** Cellist (since the cellist must be to the left of the coffee drinker and the person who likes yellow)
- **House 4:** Person who likes root beer (since the person who likes root beer must be in House 4 or 5, and the person who likes yellow is in House 2)
- **House 5:** Person who likes yellow (since the person who likes yellow is in House 2 or 1, and the person who likes root beer is in House 4)

"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct house for each person.

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in house 3.
   - House 3: Fried Rice

2. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means if the person who had stew lives in house \(x\), the person who likes red lives in house \(x-1\).

4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 2.

5. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
   - This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 4.

6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes green cannot be in house 2.

7. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if the person who likes blue lives in house \(x\), the person who ate spaghetti must live in house \(x+1\).

8. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
   - This means if the person who likes white lives in house \(x\), the person who ate grilled cheese must live in house \(x+1\) or \(x+2\).

Let's start by placing the person who ate fried rice in house 3:
- House 3: Fried Rice

Next, we need to place the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow. Since there is one house between them, they must be in houses 1 and 5 or 2 and 4. Let's consider both possibilities:

### Possibility 1: White in house 1, Yellow in house 5
- House 1: White
- House 5: Yellow

Now, we need to place the person who had stew. Since stew cannot be in house 2 or 4, stew must be in house 1 or 5. But house 1 is already taken by white, so stew must be in house 5. This is not possible because yellow is already in house 5.

### Possibility 2: White in house 2, Yellow in house 4
- House 2: White
- House 4: Yellow

Now, we need to place the person who had stew. Since stew cannot be in house 2 or 4, stew must be in house 1 or 5. Let's try stew in house 1:
- House 1: Green
- House 2: White
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

Now, we need to place the person who likes red. Red must be in house 4 (since it is directly left of stew in house 1):
- House 1: Green
- House 2: White
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

Finally, we need to place the person who ate grilled cheese. Grilled cheese must be to the right of the person who likes white (white is in house 2):
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 2: White
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

Thus, the person who likes white lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives in the second house.
   - This means the percussionist lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 1**: The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the basketball player cannot be in house 3.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who likes red lives in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house number 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2.

5. **Clue 3**: The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

From Clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in house 2. From Clue 2, the person who likes red lives in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who likes yellow and house 4 for the violinist.

Now, considering Clue 1 and Clue 3:
- The violinist must be to the right of the basketball player.
- The basketball player must be to the right of the tennis player.

Given the constraints:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow (Clue 4)
- House 2: Percussionist (Clue 5)
- House 3: Person who likes red (Clue 2)
- House 4: Violinist

Since the violinist (Clue 1) must be to the right of the basketball player, and the basketball player cannot be in house 3, the only possible position for the basketball player is house 1. This leaves house 4 for the violinist.

Thus, the basketball player lives in house number 1.

The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (A) 1."

The answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct placement of each person and their possessions. Let's go through the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.

17. **Clue 17:** There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's start by placing the dog owner in the second house based on Clue 3.

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: ?
### House 5: ?

Next, we place the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who drives a truck based on Clue 4 and Clue 12.

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: ?
### House 5: ?

Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck, and there are two houses between the truck and the convertible, we can place the truck and the convertible.

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: ?
### House 5: ?

Let's place the truck in House 4 and the convertible in House 6 (since there are two houses between the truck and the convertible, and the convertible must be in the fifth house).

### House 1: ?
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

Now, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 4.

### House 1: Bouquet of daffodils
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

Next, we place the person who has a gameboy and the person who has a radio based on Clue 2.

### House 1: Bouquet of daffodils
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

The gameboy must be to the left of the radio, so the gameboy is in House 1 and the radio is in House 2.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

Next, we place the person who has a bouquet of lilies based on Clue 5.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Fish enthusiast
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

The bouquet of lilies cannot be in House 5, so it must be in House 3.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

Next, we place the person who has a vase of tulips based on Clue 10.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Truck
### House 5: Convertible

The vase of tulips must be to the left of the person who owns horses, and the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. The convertible is in House 5, so the vase of tulips must be in House 4.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

Now, we place the person who has a computer based on Clue 8.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Dog owner
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

The person who has a computer must be in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy must be in House 1.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Computer
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

Finally, we place the person who has a television and the person who owns an SUV based on Clue 17.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Computer
### House 3: Bouquet of lilies
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: Convertible

The person who has a television must be in House 3, and the person who owns an SUV must be in House 5.

### House 1: Gameboy
### House 2: Computer
### House 3: Television
### House 4: Vase of tulips
### House 5: SUV

Thus, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not adjacent.

2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - This means the tea drinker and the cricketer are adjacent.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
   - This means the person who only drinks water and the fish enthusiast are not adjacent.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the pizza eater and the dog owner are adjacent.

5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player lives in house 1.

6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 1.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are not adjacent.

Given the basketball player and the saxophonist both live in house 1, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- House 2: Cat lover (tea drinker, pizza eater)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (cricketer, dog owner)

From Clue 4, the pizza eater and the dog owner are adjacent, so they must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the cat lover (tea drinker) is in house 2, the dog owner must be in house 3.

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 2**: The history book buff lives in the first house (house 1).
   - Therefore, the person in house 1 has a history book and the person in house 2 has a romance book.

2. **Clue 3**: The cat lover does not live in the second house (house 2).
   - This means the cat lover must live in house 1.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
   - Since the history book buff lives in house 1, the person with a computer must be in house 2 (since house 1 is already taken by the history book buff).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - Since the person with loafers is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1. This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: History book buff (romance book lover) and person with loafers (loafers).
- House 2: Cat lover (cat enthusiast) and person with computer (computer).

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2, and the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1 (as house 2 is taken by the cat lover and the person with a computer), the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the house where the person who had pizza lives:

1. **Carnations in House 1.**
2. **Apples in House 2.**
3. **Daffodils and Bouquet of Daffodils in House 3.**
4. **Banana and Pianist in a house with 2 or 3 houses between them.**
5. **Stew and Grilled Cheese next to each other.**
6. **Mangos not in House 4 or 5.**
7. **Tulips not in House 3.**
8. **Guitarist not in House 3.**
9. **Pizza to the right of Saxophonist.**
10. **Banana and Pianist 2-3 houses apart.**
11. **Mangos not in House 4.**
12. **Pianist not in House 5.**
13. **Guitarist not in House 3.**
14. **Pizza to the right of Grilled Cheese.**
15. **Pizza not in House 5.**

From Clue 1, we know the carnations are in House 1.

From Clue 2, the apples are in House 2.

From Clue 3, the daffodils are in House 3.

From Clue 4, the banana and pianist are in a house with 2-3 houses between them. Since the daffodils are in House 3, the pianist must be in House 4 or 5, and the banana must be in House 2 or 3. Since the daffodils are in House 3, the pianist must be in House 4 (since House 5 is not an option for the pianist).

From Clue 5, the grilled cheese and stew are next to each other. Since the pianist is in House 4, the grilled cheese must be in House 3, and the stew in House 5.

From Clue 6, the mangos are not in House 4 or 5, so they must be in House 1 or 2. Since the carnations are in House 1, the mangos must be in House 2.

From Clue 7, the pianist is not in House 5, which is already assigned to the stew.

From Clue 8, the tulips are not in House 3, so they must be in House 1, 2, or 4. Since the carnations are in House 1 and the apples are in House 2, the tulips must be in House 4.

From Clue 9, the guitarist is not in House 3, so they must be in House 1, 2, 4, or 5. Since the carnations are in House 1, the apples are in House 2, and the tulips are in House 4, the guitarist must be in House 5.

From Clue 10, the bouquet of daffodils is in House 3, and the person eating apples (House 2) is to the left of the person with the bouquet of daffodils. This is consistent with the arrangement.

From Clue 11, the person eating bananas is 2-3 houses away from the pianist. Since the pianist is in House 4 and the bananas are in House 2, this is consistent.

From Clue 12, the guitarist is in House 5.

From Clue 13, the person with pizza is to the right of the saxophonist. Since the pianist is in House 4, the saxophonist must be in House 3, and the person with pizza must be in House 5.

From Clue 14, the person with pizza is to the right of the grilled cheese, and the grilled cheese is in House 3. Therefore, the person with pizza must be in House 5.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The history book buff lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. **Clue 12**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
4. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.

9. **Clue 9**: The flutist does not live in the first house.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
11. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who likes green lives.
12. **Clue 11**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the history book buff in the second house:
1. History book buff (2)

Next, we need to place the person who had pizza and the person who ate fried rice. According to Clue 10 and Clue 12, the person who had pizza must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the percussionist must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Also, there is one house between the history book buff and the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 14). This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house, and the person who had pizza must be in the first house:
1. Pizza (1)
2. History book buff (2)
3. Spaghetti (4)
4. ?

Now, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice (Clue 8). Since the person who ate fried rice must be in the fourth house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the third house:
1. Pizza (1)
2. History book buff (2)
3. Bouquet of daffodils (3)
4. Fried rice (4)

The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover (Clue 5).

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

**Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

**Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.

- If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).

"Given the clues, let's analyze the situation systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
   - This implies the root beer lover must live in the first house.

2. **Clue 2:** The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.
   - This means the pianist and the cellist must be in adjacent houses, with the pianist in the house to the left of the cellist.

Given the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the root beer lover lives in the first house (house 1), we can deduce the following:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the pianist and the cellist must be in houses 1 and 2.
- Since the pianist must be to the left of the cellist, the pianist must be in house 1 and the cellist must be in house 2.

Thus, the root beer lover lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct placement of each person and their belongings.

1. **Clue 7**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
   - This means the fifth house is occupied by the person with carnations.

2. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
   - This means the fourth house is not occupied by the person with tulips.

3. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are adjacent.

4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.
   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are separated by one house.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are in different houses, and the person with tulips is to the right of the person with daffodils.

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are adjacent, and the person with tulips is to the left of the person with loafers.

7. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are adjacent, and the person with boots is to the left of the person with carnations.

8. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
   - This means the fifth house is not occupied by the person with sandals.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- Fifth house: Person with carnations.
- Fourth house: Not tulips.
- Third house: Not daffodils (since daffodils and running shoes are adjacent).
- Second house: Not tulips (since tulips are to the right of daffodils).
- First house: Not sandals (since sandals are not in the fifth house).

Now, let's place the people based on the clues:
- The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with boots and the person with carnations are adjacent, so the fourth house is not occupied by boots.
- The person with sandals is not in the fifth house, so the fourth house is not occupied by sandals.
- The person with tulips is to the right of the person with daffodils.
- The person with tulips is not in the fourth house.
- The person with tulips is adjacent to the person with loafers.
- The person with running shoes and the person with daffodils are adjacent, and the person with running shoes is one house away from the person with lilies.

Let's place the remaining people:
- The person with sandals is in the first house.
- The person with boots is in the fourth house.
- The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with tulips is in the third house (since it is to the right of the person with daffodils and adjacent to the person with loafers).
- The person with daffodils is in the second house (since it is adjacent to the person with running shoes and the person with tulips is in the third house).
- The person with running shoes is in the second house (since it is adjacent to the person with daffodils and one house away from the person with lilies).
- The person with lilies is in the fourth house (since it is one house away from the person with running shoes).

Thus, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people in the houses step by step:

1. **Baseball player in house 2.**
2. **Swimmer and white next to each other.** This means they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
3. **One house between blue and oranges.** This means they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
4. **One house between white and tea drinker.** This means they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
5. **Blue to the left of tea drinker.** This means blue is in a house with a lower number than tea drinker.
6. **Swimmer and white next to each other.** This means they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
7. **Saxophonist to the left of tennis player.** This means they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
8. **One house between blue and oranges.** This means they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
9. **One house between white and tea drinker.** This means they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
10. **Blue to the left of tea drinker.** This means blue is in a house with a lower number than tea drinker.
11. **Coffee drinker to the right of the pianist.**
12. **Blue to the left of tea drinker.** This means blue is in a house with a lower number than tea drinker.

Let's start with the constraints:
- Baseball player in house 2.
- Swimmer and white next to each other, so they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
- One house between blue and oranges, so they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- One house between white and tea drinker, so they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- Blue to the left of tea drinker, so blue is in a house with a lower number than tea drinker.
- Blue to the left of tea drinker, so blue is in a house with a lower number than tea drinker.
- Saxophonist to the left of tennis player, so they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- One house between blue and oranges, so they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- One house between white and tea drinker, so they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- Blue to the left of tea drinker, so blue is in a house with a lower number than tea drinker.

Given these constraints, let's place the people:
- Baseball player in house 2.
- Swimmer and white next to each other, so they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
- One house between blue and oranges, so they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- One house between white and tea drinker, so they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- Blue to the left of tea drinker, so blue is in a house with a lower number than tea drinker.
- Blue to the left of tea drinker, so blue is in a house with a lower number than tea drinker.
- Saxophonist to the left of tennis player, so they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- One house between blue and oranges, so they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- One house between white and tea drinker, so they are in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.
- Blue to the left of tea drinker, so blue is in a house with a lower number than tea drinker.

By process of elimination and satisfying all the conditions, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Blue
- House 2: White
- House 3: Saxophonist, Tea drinker, Oranges
- House 4: Green, Pianist, Coffee drinker, or Percussionist

Since the saxophonist is to the left of the tennis player, and the percussionist is to the left of the green person, the only possible positions are:
- Green in house 1, Pianist in house 2, Coffee drinker in house 3, Percussionist in house 4.

This leaves the pianist in house 2.

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the first house is occupied by someone who likes white. From Clue 4, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or third house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house (since the person who had stew cannot live in the second house).

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who likes white must live in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew.

Now, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. The person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the second house (Clue 3), so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. Since the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or second house. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other (Clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker (CD) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW). This means the CD cannot be in house 2, and the SW cannot be in house 1.
2. **Clue 2:** The science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in house 1.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The SF lives in house 1.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The CD cannot be in house 1, so the CD must be in house 2.
- The SW cannot be in house 1, so the SW must be in house 1.

This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to the remaining houses. Since the CD is in house 2 and the SW is in house 1, the water drinker must be in house 1, and the romance book lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
2. The percussionist must be in House 1 because the person with the radio must be in House 2 to be directly left of the percussionist.
3. Since the percussionist is in House 1, the pianist must be in House 2 (the only remaining musical instrument).
4. Consequently, the person with the phone must be in House 1 (the only remaining device).

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

(A) 1"

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know the second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 2, the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them. This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3.

From clue 3, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the person who likes yellow must be in house 2, and the person who owns a sedan must be in house 3.

Thus, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

    Since the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, the person who owns a sedan must be in House 3, and the person who owns an SUV must be in House 4.

14. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
    - House 1: Bird Keeper
    - House 2: Loafers
    - House 3: Fish Enthusiast
    - House 4: Sandals
    - House 5: Truck

    Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in House 1, the cat lover must be in House 5.

### Conclusion

The person who drives a truck lives in House 5.

Thus, the correct answer is (C) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3** states that the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Fried Rice
   - House 3: ?

2. **Clue 4** indicates that the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. Therefore, the arrangement is:
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
   - House 3: ?

3. **Clue 2** tells us that the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the fried rice person is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the second house. Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1:
   - House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
   - House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
   - House 3: ?

4. **Clue 1** states that the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the fried rice person is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1:
   - House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Spaghetti Eater
   - House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
   - House 3: ?

From the above deductions, the only person left to place is the grilled cheese eater. Since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in House 1 (because the science fiction book fanatic is there) and cannot be in House 3 (because the grilled cheese eater cannot be to the right of the fried rice eater), the grilled cheese eater must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with the carnations arrangement (C) lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner (D).
2. The houses are numbered 1 and 2, with house 1 being the left house and house 2 being the right house.

From clue 1, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1 because they live to the left of the dog owner, who must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.
   - If the person drinking water is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means if the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person liking yellow must be in house 2.
   - If the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person liking yellow must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is **2**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2 (the right house), so the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (the left house).

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person eating grapes must also be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - Since the person eating grapes is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 1 (because the tea drinker cannot be in house 2).

From the above deductions:
- The person in house 1 is the tea drinker and is eating grapes.
- The person in house 1 is also wearing sandals.
- The person in house 2 must be the one wearing high heels.
- The person in house 2 must have a phone (since the person in house 1 has a television).
- The person in house 2 must be a water drinker (since the person in house 1 is a tea drinker).
- The person in house 2 must be eating kiwis (since the person in house 1 is eating grapes).

Therefore, the person eating kiwis lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - This means the cellist cannot be in house 3, and the person who only drinks water cannot be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - This means the violinist and the guitarist cannot be in adjacent houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The violinist does not live in the third house.
   - This means the violinist can only be in houses 2 or 3.

Given the tea drinker is in house 1, we can deduce the following:

- The cellist cannot be in house 3 (from Clue 1).
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (from Clue 4).
- The guitarist cannot be in house 3 (since the violinist cannot be there and there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

So, the possible positions for the cellist and the guitarist are:
- Cellist in house 2 (since the cellist cannot be in house 3).
- Guitarist in house 3 (since the cellist is in house 2 and there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

Let's verify this:
- The tea drinker is in house 1.
- The cellist is in house 2.
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), so the violinist must be in house 2 (but that's already taken by the cellist), so the violinist must be in house 3.
- The guitarist must be in house 3.

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
   - This means the third house is occupied by someone wearing sandals.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the first house is occupied by someone other than the person wearing running shoes.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.

4. **Clue 4:** The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
   - This means the fifth house is occupied by the tea drinker.

5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person who only drinks water cannot be in the fifth house (where the tea drinker lives), and the person who is wearing boots cannot be in the first house.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
   - This means the third house is occupied by someone who likes milk.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 5, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 5.

Since the third house is occupied by someone who likes milk and the third house is also occupied by someone wearing sandals, the person who likes milk must be wearing sandals.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who is wearing boots
- Second house: Person who is wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person who likes milk (and wearing sandals)
- Fourth house: Person who only drinks water
- Fifth house: Person who drinks tea

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct placement of the devices and meals.

1. **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza

2. **Clue 8:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.
   - Computer cannot be in house 4.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
   - Computer and gameboy must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - TV and phone must be in houses with TV to the left of phone.

5. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
   - Grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house.

6. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
   - Gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in adjacent houses.

8. **Clue 6:** The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
   - Radio cannot be in house 4.

Let's start by placing the computer and gameboy in adjacent houses, and then place the grilled cheese and radio in adjacent houses with one house between them. We can try different configurations:

- **Computer in house 1, gameboy in house 2:**
  - House 1: Computer
  - House 2: Gameboy
  - House 4: Pizza
  - House 5: Radio

  - Grilled cheese and spaghetti must be adjacent, and radio cannot be in house 4.
  - If radio is in house 3, grilled cheese must be in house 2 (but gameboy is already in house 2).
  - If radio is in house 5, grilled cheese must be in house 4 (but pizza is already in house 4).

- **Computer in house 2, gameboy in house 3:**
  - House 2: Computer

  - This is not possible because house 4 is already occupied by the gameboy.

- **Computer in house 4, gameboy in house 5:**
  - House 4: Computer
  - House 5: Gameboy
  - House 4: Pizza (already occupied)
  - House 5: Radio (already occupied)

  - This is not possible because house 5 is already occupied by the gameboy.

- **Computer in house 1, gameboy in house 3:**
  - House 1: Computer
  - House 3: Gameboy
  - House 4: Pizza
  - House 5: Radio

Finally, let's try:

- **Computer in house 1, gameboy in house 2:**
  - House 1: Computer
  - House 2: Gameboy
  - House 4: Pizza
  - House 5: Radio

  - Grilled cheese and spaghetti must be adjacent, and radio cannot be in house 4.
  - If radio is in house 3, grilled cheese must be in house 2 (but gameboy is already in house 2).

- **Computer in house 2, gameboy in house 3:**
  - House 2: Computer
  - House 3: Gameboy
  - House 4: Pizza
  - House 5: Radio

  - Grilled cheese and spaghetti must be adjacent, and radio cannot be in house 4.
  - If radio is in house 1, grilled cheese must be in house 2 (but computer is already in house 2).

- **Computer in house 3, gameboy in house 1:**
  - House 3: Computer
  - House 1: Gameboy
  - House 4: Pizza
  - House 5: Radio

  - Grilled cheese and spaghetti must be adjacent, and radio cannot be in house 4.
  - If radio is in house 2, grilled cheese must be in house 1 (but gameboy is already in house 1).

From the above configurations, the only feasible one is:

- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Gameboy
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Radio

Grilled cheese and spaghetti must be adjacent, and radio cannot be in house 4. If radio is in house 3, grilled cheese must be in house 2 (but gameboy is already in house 2).

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

**Final answer:** The number of the house where the person who ate spaghetti lives is **3**."

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the pianist must live in the third house.

### Final House for Banana

Given that the pianist lives in the third house, the person who is eating a banana must live somewhere to the right of the pianist. Therefore, the person who is eating a banana must live in the fourth or fifth house.

From clue 17, the percussionist lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the person who is eating a banana must live in the fifth house.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is **5**.

The answer is (A) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the placement of the individuals:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 2, because the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2 or 3, and the bird keeper must be in house 1 or 2. Since the bird keeper cannot be in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Since the percussionist cannot be in house 2, the percussionist must be in house 1.

From this, we know:
- The percussionist lives in house 1.
- The grilled cheese eater lives in house 2.
- The bird keeper lives in house 1 (but since the grilled cheese eater is already in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2).

This leaves the guitarist and the pizza eater to be placed in the remaining houses (houses 1 and 2). Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2, the guitarist and the pizza eater must be in the remaining houses.

Since the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2 (because the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the pizza eater cannot be in house 2).

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the house where the bird keeper lives:

1. **Clue 2**: The bird keeper lives in the third house.
   - This directly tells us that the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

2. **Clue 1**: The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - This means the cat lover can live in houses 1, 3, or 4.

3. **Clue 3**: The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
   - This means the golfer and the truck driver cannot be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
   - This means the convertible driver can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

5. **Clue 5**: The baseball player does not live in the third house.
   - This means the baseball player can live in houses 1, 2, or 4.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - This is consistent with Clue 5, as the convertible driver cannot be in the third house.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.
   - This means the sedan owner cannot be in the first house and must be in a house to the right of the baseball player.

8. **Clue 8**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - Since the bird keeper lives in house 3, the soccer player must live in house 1, 2, or 4.

9. **Clue 9**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.
   - This means the fish enthusiast must live in a house to the left of the soccer player.

Let's summarize the constraints:
- Bird keeper: House 3
- Cat lover: House 1, 2, or 4
- Golfers and truck drivers: Not adjacent
- Convertible driver: House 2, 3, or 4
- Baseball player: House 1, 2, or 4
- Sedan owner: House 2, 3, or 4 (to the right of the baseball player)
- Soccer player: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the bird keeper)
- Fish enthusiast: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the soccer player)

Given Clue 2, the bird keeper is in house 3. Let's place the other constraints:

- Convertible driver cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Baseball player cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player, so if the baseball player is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 4. If the baseball player is in house 2, the sedan owner must be in house 4. If the baseball player is in house 4, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 3 (but house 3 is taken by the bird keeper).

Let's try placing the convertible driver in house 1:
- Convertible driver in house 1
- Baseball player in house 2 (since they cannot be in house 3)
- Sedan owner in house 4 (to the right of the baseball player)

This leaves house 3 for the bird keeper and house 4 for the sedan owner. The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 or 2, but house 1 is taken by the convertible driver. So the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the sedan owner, house 2 for the fish enthusiast, and house 3 for the bird keeper.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3**: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4**: The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. **Clue 6**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. **Clue 8**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 10, we know the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses respectively, or the third and first houses respectively. Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in the second house (Clue 3), the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Now, let's consider Clue 5 and Clue 8:
- The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
- The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

Since the fish enthusiast must be in the third house (flutist), the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person wearing running shoes
- Second house: Person eating a banana
- Third house: Fish enthusiast (flutist)

From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges must be in the second house, but we already have the person eating a banana in the second house. This means the person eating oranges must be in the first house, and the person wearing loafers must be in the third house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person eating oranges
- Second house: Person eating a banana
- Third house: Fish enthusiast (flutist)

From Clue 2, the percussionist cannot be in the second house, so the percussionist must be in the first house. This leaves the pianist to be in the second house, and the cat lover to be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Cat lover (wearing loafers, eating oranges)
- Second house: Pianist (wearing running shoes, eating a banana)
- Third house: Fish enthusiast (wearing high heels, flutist)

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

2. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana must be in houses 1 and 3, or houses 2 and 4. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

3. **Clue 4**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes green must be in a house to the left of the person who likes yellow. Given the arrangement so far, the person who likes green must be in house 1 or house 2. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who likes white, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This contradicts Clue 6, which states that the person who is eating grapes is in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: Yellow

4. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who likes red lives in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, this clue is satisfied. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3 and the person who is eating kiwis must be in a house to the right of house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4. So, the arrangement is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Kiwis

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the cat lover.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the person who had stew.

From Clue 1, we know the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes is in house 2.

From Clue 2, the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses. Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the only possible positions for the mystery book reader and the cat lover are house 1 and house 2, but house 2 is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes. Therefore, the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in house 1 and house 3.

From Clue 3, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2. However, house 2 is already occupied by the person wearing running shoes. Therefore, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 3, but this contradicts the placement of the person wearing running shoes in house 2. Therefore, the only consistent placement is that the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means if the daffodils are in house \(X\), the phone must be in house \(X+1\).

2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes root beer lives in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who has a television lives in either house 1 or house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means if the person with the television is in house \(X\), the person with the vase of tulips must be in house \(X-1\).

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in house 1. From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2. From Clue 4, the person who has a television cannot live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. From Clue 5, if the person with the television lives in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 (which contradicts Clue 2). Therefore, the person with the television must live in house 3.

This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the person who likes root beer.

Thus, the person who likes root beer lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Wearing loafers

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - Phone: House 1, 2
   - Mangos: House 2, 3

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - Grapes: House 1, 2
   - Water: House 2, 3

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - Boots: House 1, 2

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - Kiwis: House 1, 2
   - Milk: House 2, 3

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Boots: House 1, 2
   - Gameboy: House 1, 2, 3
   - Boots must be in House 2 (since kiwis are in House 2)

7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - Kiwis: House 2, 3

### Deductions

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers (Clue 1)
- **House 2:** Phone, Boots, Gameboy (Clue 2, Clue 6, Clue 7)
- **House 3:** Mangos, Milk, Kiwis (Clue 2, Clue 5)

Since the person with the phone is in House 2, the person with the phone is not the one who has a computer. The person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy, so the person with the phone is the one who has a computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the placement of the people in the houses step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The golfer does not live in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.
3. **Clue 3:** The golfer and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
7. **Clue 7:** The cricketer does not live in the third house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as A, B, and C.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Golfer and Baseball Player
Since the golfer and the baseball player live next to each other, they can be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

#### Step 2: Fish Enthusiast and Horses
The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses. This means if the fish enthusiast is in house 1, the person who owns horses must be in house 2 or 3. If the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 3.

#### Step 3: Carnations and Horses
The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who owns horses live next to each other. This means if the person who owns horses is in house 2, the person who has carnations must be in house 1. If the person who owns horses is in house 3, the person who has carnations must be in house 2.

#### Step 4: Carnations and Baseball Player
The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player. This means if the person who has carnations is in house 1, the baseball player must be in house 2. If the person who has carnations is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 3.

#### Step 5: Rose Bouquet and Daffodils
The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. This means the rose bouquet and daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

### Combining Clues

Let's test the possible placements:

1. **Golfer in house 1, Baseball player in house 2:**
   - Fish enthusiast in house 1 (contradicts Clue 2).
   - Fish enthusiast in house 2 (contradicts Clue 2).
   - Fish enthusiast in house 3 (contradicts Clue 2).

2. **Golfer in house 2, Baseball player in house 3:**
   - Fish enthusiast in house 1 (possible).
   - Carnations in house 1 (possible).
   - Baseball player in house 3 (possible).
   - Rose bouquet and daffodils in houses 1 and 2 (possible).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The golfer (in house 2) and the baseball player (in house 3) are next to each other.
- The fish enthusiast (in house 1) is to the left of the person who owns horses (in house 3).
- The person who has carnations (in house 1) is to the left of the baseball player (in house 3).
- The person who has a rose bouquet (in house 1) is to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (in house 2).

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 3.

**Final Answer: (A) 3**"
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating oranges.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the truck and convertible drivers must be in adjacent houses, and the truck driver must be to the left of the convertible driver.

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the bird keeper and dog owner must be in houses with the bird keeper to the right of the dog owner.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not eating mangos.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Owning horses.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 5, we know:
- House 3: Owning horses.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Eating oranges.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 3: Not eating mangos.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in adjacent houses.

Since the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), and the person driving a convertible must be adjacent to the person eating mangos (Clue 6), the only possible positions for the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible are:
- House 1: Eating oranges (Clue 1)
- House 2: Driving a convertible (Clue 6)
- House 3: Owning horses (Clue 5)

Now, we need to place the bird keeper and the dog owner. From Clue 3, the bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are 2 and 3, but house 3 is occupied by the person owning horses. Therefore, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 1. Given that house 1 is occupied by the person eating oranges, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 3.

Thus, the only remaining house for the person driving a truck is house 2.

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics.

1. **Clue 1 and Clue 2**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader must be somewhere to the left of the percussionist, and the percussionist must be somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This implies the mystery book reader and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

2. **Clue 3**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the percussionist.

3. **Clue 4**: There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. This means the saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, and the person who had pizza must be in the second or fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader.

5. **Clue 6**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. This means the flutist must be in a house to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

6. **Clue 7**: The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the guitarist and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist.

7. **Clue 8**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese eater must be in adjacent houses, and the grilled cheese eater must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

8. **Clue 9**: There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the history book buff must be in the house directly to the right or left of the mystery book reader.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the first, second, fourth, or fifth houses.

Let's start by placing the mystery book reader and the saxophonist:
- The saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, so he must be in the second or fourth house.
- The mystery book reader must be directly left of the saxophonist, so the saxophonist must be in the second house and the mystery book reader must be in the first house.

Now, let's place the percussionist:
- The percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the percussionist must be in the third or fourth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist, so the guitarist must be in the first or second house.

Given the saxophonist is in the second house, the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the guitarist is to the left of the percussionist, the only possible positions for the percussionist are the third or fourth house. Let's check the third house:
- If the percussionist is in the third house, the guitarist must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the percussionist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the science fiction book fanatic:
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house because the mystery book reader is there.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the second house.

Now, let's place the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist:
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or second house, but the first house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.
- Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Finally, let's place the history book buff:
- The history book buff must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the history book buff must be in the third house, and the flutist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the person who ate spaghetti:
- The person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the percussionist lives in the fourth house.

1. **Sedan owner in House 1** (Clue 2).
2. **Grilled cheese eater in House 2** (Clue 8, since they live directly left of the person who likes green, and green likes is in House 1).
3. **Red likes in House 3** (Clue 5, since green likes is in House 1 and white likes is in House 2).
4. **Fried rice eater in House 4** (Clue 4, since they do not live in House 1, and there is one house between the pizza eater and the fried rice eater, so the pizza eater must be in House 3).
5. **Yellow likes in House 5** (Clue 17, since the person who likes yellow lives directly next to the person who is eating apples, and the person who is eating apples must be in House 2).
6. **Mango eater in House 5** (Clue 12, since the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV, and the SUV owner must be in House 4).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- **House 1**: Green likes
- **House 2**: Apples eater
- **House 3**: Pizza eater
- **House 4**: SUV owner
- **House 5**: Yellow likes, Mango eater

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in **House 5**.

1. **Clue 7**: The person who has a radio lives in house 3.
   - House 3: Radio

2. **Clue 8**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - This means the percussionist and the person who likes white must be in adjacent houses, with the percussionist in a lower-numbered house.

3. **Clue 9**: The person who likes red does not live in house 2.
   - This means the person who likes red cannot be in house 2.

   - This means the television and the person who likes red must be in adjacent houses, with the television in a lower-numbered house.

10. **Clue 2**: The cellist does not live in house 5.
    - This means the cellist cannot be in house 5.

11. **Clue 1**: The percussionist and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
    - This means the percussionist and guitarist must be in adjacent houses.

12. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives in house 3.
    - House 3: Green

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 3: Green
- House 3: Radio
- House 3: Computer (since the computer must be to the left of the phone, and the computer cannot be in house 2)
- House 3: Phone (since the computer is in house 3, the phone must be in house 4)
- House 3: Gameboy (since the phone is in house 4, the gameboy must be in house 3)
- House 3: Television (since the television lives directly left of the person who likes red, and the television is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2)
- House 2: Red
- House 2: Percussionist (since the percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white, and the percussionist is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 3)
- House 3: White
- House 3: Saxophonist (since the saxophonist must be in the remaining house, which is house 1)
- House 1: Saxophonist
- House 1: Guitarist (since the guitarist lives directly next to the percussionist, and the percussionist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1)
- House 1: Green (already confirmed)
- House 1: Cellist (since the cellist does not live in house 5, and the cellist cannot be in house 1, the cellist must be in house 4)

- House 2: White (already confirmed)
- House 2: Guitarist (already confirmed)
- House 2: Cellist (already confirmed)
- House 2: Television (already confirmed)
- House 5: Violinist (since the violinist lives two houses away from the percussionist, and the percussionist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 5)
- House 5: Violinist

Thus, the saxophonist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist must be in house 1 and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - Given the positions of the cellist and the mystery book reader, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2. However, this directly contradicts Clue 2, which states that the history book buff and the cat lover are in houses 1 and 2. Therefore, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, but not in the order of Clue 2.

Given Clue 2, the only way to satisfy it is if the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2. This leaves the root beer lover and the guitarist in houses 1 and 2, but since they must be next to each other, they must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

### Summary of the arrangement:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

   - This means if the person eating a banana is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 2. This is because the banana eater cannot be in house 3, and the dog owner cannot be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not banana, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana.
- House 4: Not horses.

From Clue 5, the person who owns horses cannot be in house 2. Since the dog owner is in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not banana, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana.
- House 4: Not horses, owns horses.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in adjacent houses. Since the person eating bananas is in house 1, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

Since the person eating kiwis cannot be in house 1, and the person eating bananas is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 3, and the bird keeper must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not banana, dog owner, bird keeper.
- House 3: Not banana, eating kiwis.
- House 4: Not horses, owns horses.

The bird keeper lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

From Clue 2, the bird keeper and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the possible adjacent houses are the second and third houses.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper cannot be in the third house (since the romance book lover does not live there and the person who owns horses does not live there either). Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house, and the history book buff must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the person who owns horses cannot be in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the history book buff, the person who owns horses must be in the first house. However, the first house is already occupied by the mystery book reader, so the person who owns horses must be in the second house, which contradicts the bird keeper being in the second house. Therefore, the person who owns horses must be in the third house, and the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: History book buff

Since the bird keeper lives in the second house, the romance book lover must live in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the placement of the people in the houses step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
   - This directly places the coffee drinker in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, with the apple eater to the left of the water drinker.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 2, 3, or 4.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 1 or 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the apple eater must be in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.
   - This means the kiwi eater lives in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives in house 2.
- From Clue 4, the mangos eater cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 4.
- From Clue 6, the kiwi eater cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1, 2, or 4.
- From Clue 2, the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, and the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker.
- From Clue 5, the apple eater must be to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's try to place the people based on these constraints:

- If the mangos eater is in house 1, then the kiwi eater must be in house 4 (since they cannot be in house 3).
- The apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Mangos eater
  - House 2: Coffee drinker (Clue 1)
  - House 3: Apple eater
  - House 4: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The mangos eater is in house 1.
- The kiwi eater is in house 4.
- The water drinker is in house 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
5. **Clue 5:** The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. **Clue 6:** The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The soccer player lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 9:** The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 10:** There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
11. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the soccer player lives in the third house (house 3).

From Clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house (house 5).

From Clue 9, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must live in house 2.

From Clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 2, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 1, and the baseball player must live in house 4.

From Clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer cannot live in house 5, and the golfer must be to the left of the cricketer, the golfer must live in house 1, and the cricketer must live in house 4.

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives. Since the person who likes white lives in house 2 (where the person who is eating kiwis lives), the person who likes blue must live in house 4 (where the cricketer lives).

From Clue 1, the person who likes white (house 2) lives directly left of the person who likes red (house 4). Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who likes red must live in house 1.

From Clue 3, the person who likes white (house 2) lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player (house 4). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the person who likes white (house 2) lives and where the person who is eating apples (house 4). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From Clue 6, the cricketer (house 4) does not live in the fifth house, which is consistent.

From Clue 9, the person who is eating kiwis (house 2) and the person who is eating a banana (house 3) live directly next to each other, which is consistent.

Thus, the person who is eating a banana lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Stew and High Heels:**
   - The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the person with high heels cannot be in the third house, and the person with stew cannot be in the first house.

2. **Daffodils and Golfer:**
   - There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
   - This means the golfer cannot be in the first or third house, and the person with daffodils cannot be in the first or second house.

3. **Rose Bouquet and Spaghetti:**
   - The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person with spaghetti cannot be in the first house, and the person with rose bouquet cannot be in the third house.

4. **Mystery Book Reader:**
   - The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
   - This means the mystery book reader can live in the first or third house.

5. **History Book Buff and Stew:**

   - This means the person with stew cannot be in the third house, and the person with history book buff cannot be in the first house.

6. **Running Shoes and Stew:**
   - The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person with running shoes cannot be in the first house, and the person with stew cannot be in the third house.

7. **Soccer Player:**

   - This means the person with the rose bouquet cannot be in the second house.

### Deductions

### Conclusion

The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

From Clue 6, the flutist must be in house 1 and the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2. This is because the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan.

Now, let's consider Clue 5: The person who drives a minivan (house 2) lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck (house 1). This means the truck must be in house 1 and the person who drives a truck is in house 1.

From Clue 2, the person who drives a truck (house 1) and the person who has a gameboy (house 1) live directly next to each other. This is a contradiction because the truck and the gameboy cannot be in the same house. Therefore, we need to reassess the placement.

Let's try another arrangement:

- If the flutist is in house 1, the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2.
- From Clue 5, the person who drives a minivan (house 2) lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck (house 1). This means the truck must be in house 1 and the person who drives a truck is in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the person who drives a truck (house 1) and the person who has a gameboy (house 1) live directly next to each other. This is a contradiction again.

Given the contradictions, let's try the following arrangement:

- The flutist is in house 1.
- The person who drives a minivan is in house 2.
- The person who drives a truck is in house 3.
- The person who has a gameboy is in house 3.
- The person who has a television is in house 1 (since the person with high heels and the person with the television must be next to each other, and the gameboy is in house 3, the television must be in house 1).
- The person who is wearing high heels is in house 3.
- The person who is wearing boots is in house 3 (since the person with boots must be to the right of the percussionist, and the percussionist must be in house 1).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- Clue 1: The person with a phone (house 1) is to the left of the person who drives a minivan (house 2).
- Clue 2: The person who drives a truck (house 3) and the person who has a gameboy (house 3) are next to each other.
- Clue 3: The person who drives a minivan (house 2) and the cellist (house 2) are next to each other.
- Clue 4: The person who is wearing high heels (house 3) and the person who has a television (house 1) are next to each other.
- Clue 5: The person who drives a minivan (house 2) is to the right of the person who drives a truck (house 1).
- Clue 6: The flutist (house 1) is directly left of the person who drives a minivan (house 2).
- Clue 7: The person who is wearing boots (house 3) is to the right of the percussionist (house 1).

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

5. **Clue 8**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

11. **Clue 12**: The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the SUV lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the root beer lover).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan driver cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the minivan driver).

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.
- The truck driver is to the right of the root beer lover.
- The minivan driver is not in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Blue and Spaghetti**: The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
2. **Stew and Lilies**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. **Rose and Truck**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
4. **Minivan and Stew**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
5. **Red and First House**: The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. **Minivan and Daffodils**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 4, we know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the minivan person must be in house 2, and the person who had stew must be in house 1.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3.

From Clue 3, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in house 2, the person who drives a truck must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who likes red does not live in the first house. Since the person who likes red must be in house 3, and the person who likes red does not live in the first house, this is consistent.

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"To determine the house where the person who owns a sedan lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 6:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 15:** The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 14:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
6. **Clue 13:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 12:** The person who likes green does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 10:** The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 7:** The flutist lives in the third house.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. From Clue 8, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. From Clue 9, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. From Clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house, so the sedan owner must live in either the first, third, or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must live in either the first or third house.

From Clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. From Clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. From Clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. From Clue 7, the flutist lives in the third house. Therefore, the cellist must live in the second house (since the flutist lives in the third house and they must be next to each other).

Now, let's summarize the known information:
- Second house: Flutist
- Third house: Cellist
- Fourth house: Person who owns an SUV (and also the person who likes white)

Since the sedan owner cannot be in the second house (Clue 15) and the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must be in the first house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this problem, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in House 3 (since there is no house to the left of House 3), and the person who likes white must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 2 is already taken by the person who likes red, the person who likes white must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 2: Red
   - House 1: White

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

7. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - This is already confirmed as House 3.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This is already confirmed as House 1.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.
- The person who has a television must be in House 4.
- The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who has a phone must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the placement of each person:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper lives in the second house.
   - This directly tells us the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the violinist cannot live in house number 1, and the bouquet of lilies cannot live in house number 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot live in house number 4, and the person who had pizza cannot live in house number 1.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
   - This means the violinist and the person with the rose bouquet must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner must live in the house immediately to the right of the person with the vase of tulips.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
   - This means the saxophonist cannot live in house number 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house number 4.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot live in house number 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot live in house number 4.

8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot live in house number 4, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house number 1.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the person who owns horses lives in house number 4.

10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1.

From Clue 1, we know the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper (house 2) must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (house 4). Since the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4, the bird keeper must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza must be to the right of the guitarist. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 4, the person who had pizza must be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 1.

From Clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 (guitarist), and the dog owner must be in house 2 (bird keeper).

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese (house 1) must be to the left of the guitarist (house 1), which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the placement.

Given the constraints, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who owns horses

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the characteristics of each person and their house numbers.

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live directly next to each other.

4. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (house 1).
   - Therefore, the saxophonist is in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 4, we know the saxophonist is in house 1. From Clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2 (Clue 2).

Now, Clue 1 tells us the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2. Since the golfer is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 1. This leaves house 2 for the person eating grapes.

From Clue 3, the baseball player and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2. Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1.

Thus, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker, Baseball player, Saxophonist
- House 2: Person eating grapes, Golfer

The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2, as the person eating grapes is in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we can conclude that the first house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing boots.

Next, let's consider the second house:
- **Clue 1**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the second house.

Since the first house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing boots, the second house must be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies and the person wearing high heels. This leaves the third house to be occupied by the person with the remaining flowers (roses) and the person wearing the remaining shoes (running shoes).

Therefore, the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions, let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The coffee drinker does not live in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 2**: The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
3. **Clue 3**: The basketball player and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. **Clue 5**: The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
6. **Clue 6**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the fifth house.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
10. **Clue 10**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
11. **Clue 11**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
12. **Clue 12**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
13. **Clue 13**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player.
14. **Clue 14**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing boots in the first house (House 1) as per Clue 13. This means the basketball player must be in House 2.

Now, the basketball player and the tennis player must be adjacent, so they can be in Houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the basketball player is in House 2 and the tennis player in House 3, then the root beer lover must be in House 4 (Clue 2) and the person wearing high heels in House 5.
- The cricketer must be in House 5 (Clue 11) and the person who only drinks water in House 4 (Clue 9 and Clue 10).

This leaves the following arrangement:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Basketball player
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 4: Root beer lover, Cricketer, Person who only drinks water
- House 5: High heels, Stew

Since the cricketer must be to the right of the person who is wearing sandals (Clue 11), the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1 (already occupied by boots), so the cricketer must be in House 5.

This leaves the person who only drinks water in House 4. Now, the tea drinker must be in House 3 (Clue 5) and the person who had pizza in House 4 (Clue 5).

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Basketball player
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Person who only drinks water, Cricketer, Person who had pizza
- House 5: High heels, Stew

Therefore, the tea drinker lives in House 3.

13. **Clue 13:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who likes green.
14. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in the first house (Clue 2).

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 5: Vase of tulips (Clue 4)
- House 2: Bouquet of lilies (Clue 5)
- House 3: Root beer lover (Clue 11, cannot be in house 3)
- House 4: Coffee drinker (Clue 14, must be somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow)

- House 9: Root beer lover (Clue 11, cannot be in house 9)
- House 10: Root beer lover (Clue 11, cannot be in house 10)

- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover

"Given the clues, let's analyze the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

From Clue 3, if Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck. However, this leads to a contradiction because Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow and eat grapes simultaneously. Therefore, Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow.

Since Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck. From Clue 1, the person who drives a truck (Person 1) must be eating grapes. Therefore, Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.

From Clue 2, the person who wears boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Since Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck and eats grapes, Person 2 (House 2) must wear boots. Thus, Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.

This leaves Person 1 (House 1) as the fantasy book enthusiast.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **1**."

"To solve this, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1.
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. **Clue 9**: The person who likes red lives directly to the left of the person who likes green.

   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

7. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - House 2: Percussionist
   - House 3: Pizza

8. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the soccer player lives and where the guitarist lives.
   - The only remaining houses are 1 and 4, but house 4 is occupied by the saxophonist. Therefore, the soccer player must live in house 1 and the guitarist must live in house 4.

9. **Clue 3**: There are two houses between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the saxophonist lives.
   - House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast
   - House 4: Saxophonist

10. **Clue 1**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
    - The person who ate grilled cheese must live in house 2 or house 4. Since house 4 is occupied by the saxophonist, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in house 2.

11. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
    - The only remaining houses are 1 and 4, but house 4 is occupied by the saxophonist. Therefore, the violinist must live in house 1 and the person who likes blue must live in house 2.

From the analysis, we can see that the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. **Clue 2:** The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The violinist lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the violinist lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: ?

From Clue 3, the violinist lives in the second house, so the violinist is in House 2.

From Clue 1, the cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer cannot be in House 3, because the cellist would then be in House 3, which would make the cellist to the left of the cricketer. Therefore, the cricketer must be in House 1, and the cellist must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player lives in the second house, the basketball player is in House 2. This leaves the soccer player to live in House 1 or House 3. But we already know the cricketer lives in House 1 and the cellist lives in House 3.

Therefore, the soccer player must live in House 1.

The number of the house where the soccer player lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 3.

4. **Clue 6:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the first house.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house. So, the violinist must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 7, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must live in the first or second house, and the guitarist must live in the third or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the guitarist must live in the third house. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the first or second house.

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other. This means they must be in adjacent houses.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player must live in the first or second house, and the fish enthusiast must live in the third or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other. This means they must be in adjacent houses.

- Second house: Cricketer (clue 7)
- First house: Tennis player (clue 4)
- First or second house: Fish enthusiast (clue 9)
- First or second house: Basketball player (clue 9)
- First or second house: Root beer lover (clue 8)
- First or second house: Person who only drinks water (clue 10)

"Given the clues:

1. The violinist lives in the first house (house 1).
2. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.

From the first clue, we know the violinist is in house 1. This means the person with a computer must be in house 1 as well, since house 1 is to the left of house 2.

Since the person in house 1 is the violinist, the person in house 2 must be the bird keeper. The person in house 2 cannot have a computer (as the computer is in house 1), so the person in house 2 must have a gameboy. Consequently, the person in house 2 must be the guitarist.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Rose bouquet
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Not science fiction book fanatic (Clue 9)

Since the person with the computer must live somewhere to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils (Clue 18), and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must live somewhere to the right of the person with the vase of tulips (Clue 19), we can infer the following:
- The person with the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in house 1, 2, or 3 (since the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the person with the television is in house 3).
- The person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4 or 5.

Given that the person with pizza is in house 4, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 5 (since the person with pizza lives directly left of the person with spaghetti, and the person with spaghetti must be in house 5).

Thus, the person with the computer must be in house 5.

The number of the house where the person who has a computer lives is **5**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.

   - House 3: Sedan

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - House 1: High Heels
   - House 2: Boots
   - House 3: Sedan

Since the person wearing high heels lives in house 1, and the cat lover lives in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be the cat lover. This leaves the person wearing running shoes to live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **The tea drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. **The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.**
   - This means the person who likes blue lives in House 2, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in House 1.

3. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.**
   - Since the tea drinker lives in House 3, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in Houses 1 and 2.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Carnations

5. **The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Tulips

6. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
   - This means the person who likes green lives in House 1, and the person who is wearing boots lives in House 2.

7. **The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. **The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.**

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Running shoes, Carnations, Person who likes green
- House 2: Tulips, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other, and the only remaining house for the person who likes milk is House 3, the person who is eating apples must be in House 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in House 2.

"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From Clue 2, we know the mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as Mystery Reader (MR), History Book Buff (HBB), and Science Fiction Fanatic (SFF).

From Clue 1, the mystery book reader (MR) must be in the first house, and the history book buff (HBB) must be in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the history book buff (HBB), which contradicts Clue 1. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Since the mystery book reader (MR) is in the first house, the history book buff (HBB) must be in the third house. This means the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: ?
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the person who has a computer (C). So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 3, the person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P). Since the person with the computer is in the second house, the person with the phone must be in the first house. This means the person with the phone is the mystery book reader (MR). This is consistent with Clue 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB (history book buff)

The person who has a phone is the mystery book reader (MR), and the person who has a computer is in the second house. The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic (SFF), who must be in the third house.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

It is not impossible for pigs to use pig Latin. While pigs do not possess the cognitive abilities to understand or produce human languages, including pig Latin, they can be trained to perform tasks and respond to commands. The ability to use pig Latin, as a form of human language, is beyond their capacity due to their lack of linguistic understanding. However, this does not preclude them from engaging in other forms of communication."

"No, growing seedless cucumber might not be ideal for a gardener with entomophobia. Seedless cucumbers often rely on pollination by insects, which could trigger anxiety or fear. While manual pollination is possible, it still involves dealing with insects, which might be unsettling for someone with entomophobia. Therefore, a gardener with entomophobia might prefer to grow regular cucumbers, which do not require pollination and thus do not involve insects."
"To determine if Martin Luther would run out of theses in half a year if he wrote one per day, we need to consider the number of days in half a year. Half a year is approximately 182.5 days.

Ariana Grande could be a relevant topic in a presentation about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Given her public disclosure of experiencing PTSD following the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, her story can serve as a compelling example of someone who has overcome significant trauma.

"Euphoria is indeed commonly associated with drug addiction. This heightened state of pleasure and well-being is often sought after and can be a significant motivator for individuals to continue using drugs, even in the face of adverse consequences. However, it's crucial to recognize that euphoria is not exclusive to drug use and can be experienced through various means, such as engaging in enjoyable activities or through natural physiological responses. The intensity and duration of euphoria can vary greatly and may be accompanied by other effects like increased energy or altered perception. Therefore, while the link between euphoria and drug addiction is strong, it's important to consider the broader context of how this feeling can influence behavior.

"Given the context of these fictional characters, it is challenging to definitively determine whether Apollo could defeat D'Artagnan. However, based on the descriptions:

- Apollo is a god associated with prophecy, healing, and the sun, which suggests supernatural or divine attributes.
- D'Artagnan is a musketeer known for his bravery, loyalty, and physical prowess, trained in swordsmanship.

Considering these attributes, it is reasonable to assume that D'Artagnan, with his training and experience, would be a formidable opponent. However, without knowing the exact abilities of Apollo, it is difficult to definitively say whether he could defeat D'Artagnan.

Therefore, the most reasonable answer is:

(A) No"

Sunscreen is primarily used to prevent skin cancer by protecting the skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. However, it is not effective in treating existing skin cancer, such as the melanoma that killed Bob Marley. Therefore, while sunscreen is unhelpful in preventing the condition that killed Bob Marley, it is not unhelpful in the context of preventing skin cancer."
"The French Defense, as a standard chess opening, does not include the specific sequence of moves that would lead to a four-move checkmate. The four-move checkmate is a rare and highly specific sequence that can only occur in a very particular setup of the board and pieces. Therefore, the French Defense cannot be used to defend against a four-move checkmate. 

The answer is:
(B) No"
"Week-old chlorine-treated water is not safe to drink. Chlorine is effective for disinfecting water but its effectiveness diminishes over time, and the water may become recontaminated. Additionally, the presence of chlorine can lead to the formation of disinfection byproducts, which can be harmful. Therefore, it is advisable to consume water that has been treated and stored properly, or to use fresh water for drinking purposes. The correct answer to the question ""Is week-old chlorine water safe to drink?"" is:

(B) No"

(B) No"
"Elizabeth I of England reigned from 1558 to 1603. The play ""Dido, Queen of Carthage"" by Christopher Marlowe was first performed in 1587. Given this information, Elizabeth I would not have been alive to see the play performed during her reign. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"Avoiding internet trolls on Reddit is not entirely possible, as trolls are a part of the community and their behavior is often designed to provoke and disrupt. However, there are several strategies you can employ to minimize their impact:

1. **Ignore and Report**: Trolls often seek attention, so ignoring their posts and reporting them can help reduce their visibility.
2. **Use Filters and Subreddit Settings**: Some subreddits have filters or settings that can help reduce the number of troll posts you see.
3. **Stay Alert and Vigilant**: Be aware of the signs of troll behavior and be prepared to take action if necessary.
4. **Engage with Respect**: While engaging with trolls can sometimes help, it is not always effective and can sometimes escalate the situation.
5. **Use Moderators**: If a troll is causing significant disruption, flagging the post or the user to the subreddit's moderators can help address the issue.

These strategies can help mitigate the effects of trolls, but they cannot completely eliminate them from the Reddit community."

Sea turtles, as marine reptiles, do not experience quarantine in the same way humans do. They are not affected by human quarantine measures and their survival and well-being are influenced by environmental factors such as water quality, food availability, and the presence of predators. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that sea turtles are enjoying life during quarantine."
"(B) No

Jesus, as a historical figure within the context of the 1st century CE, lived in a time and culture that did not include the modern concept of the Easter Bunny. The Easter Bunny is a figure from folklore and modern popular culture, associated with Easter celebrations and the idea of Easter eggs. Given this historical and cultural divergence, it is highly unlikely that Jesus would have any familiarity or understanding of the Easter Bunny."
"An elephant would not easily defeat a male macaque. The physical and biological differences between these two species are substantial. Elephants are much larger, stronger, and more powerful, with significant advantages in terms of size, strength, and weaponry (tusks). Male macaques, while capable of defending themselves, lack the physical capabilities to match an elephant in a direct confrontation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"

"A: (A) No

The most expensive color in the world is not blue. While ultramarine, a deep blue pigment, is very expensive due to its production process, which involves grinding lapis lazuli, the term ""most expensive color"" is not commonly used or universally agreed upon. The perception of color value can vary based on cultural, artistic, and commercial contexts. Therefore, without a widely accepted definition, it's not accurate to state that blue is the most expensive color."
"(B) No

Ryan Crouser, being a professional shot putter and javelin thrower, possesses exceptional strength and skill in throwing objects over long distances. However, a bengal fox is a small wild animal that is not within the scope of his athletic abilities or ethical considerations.

"Given the context of Lord Voldemort's rule and the strict measures he would likely implement at Hogwarts, it is plausible that he could have set rules that would have barred him from the school. Therefore, the answer is:

(B) Yes"
"To address the question of whether The Jackson 5 was bigger than The Isley Brothers in terms of the size of the family band, we need to consider the number of members in each group and their respective impacts on the music industry.

The Jackson 5 consisted of five members: Michael, Jermaine, Tito, Marlon, and Jackie Jackson. They were a significant and influential group in the 1960s and 1970s, known for their distinctive vocal harmonies and hits like ""I Want You Back"" and ""ABC.""

The Isley Brothers, on the other hand, had four members: O'Kelly, Ronald, Ernie, and Rudolph Isley. While they were also a successful and influential group, particularly known for their soulful harmonies and hits such as ""Shout"" and ""It's Your Thing,"" they did not have as many members as The Jackson 5.

Given these details, The Jackson 5 was indeed a bigger family band than The Isley Brothers.

Therefore, the stocks of robotics companies were not directly hurt by the Wall Street Crash of 1929.

(A) No"
"To determine if Moon Jae-in was born outside of Khanbaliq, we need to consider the historical and geographical context. Khanbaliq, the capital of the Yuan Dynasty, was located in what is now Beijing, China. Moon Jae-in, the current President of South Korea, was born in Seoul, South Korea, in 1953. Given this information, it is clear that Moon Jae-in was not born outside of Khanbaliq, as Khanbaliq is in China, and Seoul is in South Korea.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"
"A person with Anorexia Nervosa would be more likely to break a bone than a regular person. This increased risk stems from the severe malnutrition and low body mass index (BMI) characteristic of the disorder. These factors lead to a higher likelihood of developing osteoporosis, a condition where bones become fragile and more susceptible to fractures. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Yes"
"The travelers on the Oregon Trail did not typically sing sea shanties. Sea shanties are associated with maritime work, whereas the Oregon Trail was a land route used by settlers moving westward across the United States. The music and songs of the Oregon Trail were more likely to be ballads, hymns, or other types of folk songs that were common in the frontier culture of the time. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"

Michael Vick's dog fighting conviction resulted in a prison sentence of 230 months (over 19 years), which is significantly longer than the maximum possible prison sentence for shooting a bald eagle, which is 10 years. Therefore, it is highly improbable that a person would receive a prison sentence for shooting a bald eagle that exceeds the sentence Michael Vick received for his dog fighting conviction."
"(B) No

Gandhi lived from 1869 to 1948, and television was not invented until the 1920s. The first television broadcast in the United States occurred in 1938, and it was not until the 1950s that television became widely available and popular. Given Gandhi's lifetime and the timeline of television's development, it is highly improbable that he would have watched the show Bonanza, which aired from 1959 to 1973."
"No, hornets do not provide meaningful data for oceanographers. Oceanographers study the vast and complex systems of the ocean, including its physical properties, chemical composition, and biological communities.

(A) No"
"To determine if a grey seal can swim in the same water as the subject of Moby Dick, we need to consider the geographical and biological contexts.

Grey seals are marine mammals that primarily inhabit the North Atlantic and North Pacific. They are known to live in coastal waters, bays, and estuaries. On the other hand, Moby Dick is a novel by Herman Melville, published in 1851, and the story is set in the waters around the North Atlantic. Given that grey seals are found in these same waters, it is reasonable to conclude that a grey seal can indeed swim in the same water as the subject of Moby Dick.

Therefore, the answer is:

(A) Yes"

Hippos are indeed primarily found in Africa, but they can also be found in other parts of the world, such as zoos and wildlife parks. There is a small population of hippos in Nepal, which is not in Africa. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that you can only see hippos in Africa."
"No, people do not typically celebrate Earth Day with a ceremonial tire fire. Earth Day is an occasion to raise awareness about environmental issues and promote sustainability through various activities such as tree planting, clean-up drives, and educational workshops. A tire fire would be environmentally harmful and not aligned with the goals of Earth Day."
"To determine if Buddy the Elf knows anyone who works in publishing, we need to consider the nature of Buddy's existence and the setting of the movie ""Elf.""

Buddy is an elf from the North Pole, specifically from Santa Claus's workshop. His life is centered around Christmas traditions, reindeer, and the magical world of elves. In contrast, the publishing industry is a human-centric field that deals with books, magazines, and other printed materials. Given the stark differences in their worlds, it is highly improbable that Buddy would have any acquaintances or connections within the publishing industry.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"A hamster does not experience leap years. Leap years are a feature of the Gregorian calendar used to synchronize the calendar with the Earth's revolutions around the Sun. Since hamsters do not have the cognitive ability to understand or experience the concept of leap years, they do not participate in or experience leap years in the same way humans do. Therefore, the correct answer is:

"Given the distinct fields of expertise and the nature of their work, it is unlikely that Jacques Duèze, a French paleontologist and geologist, and Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and philosopher of science, would have been friends. Duèze's focus is on the fossil record and the history of life, while Dawkins is more concerned with the mechanisms of evolution and their philosophical implications. Their areas of study and the methodologies they employ are quite different, making it improbable for them to have developed a personal or professional friendship. 

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"
"B: No.

Pet macaques are wild primates that are not suitable as household pets. They require specialized care, including a diet tailored to their dietary needs, a suitable living environment, and regular veterinary attention.

"The correct answer is (B) No.

Justin Bieber is a well-known figure in the entertainment industry, primarily as a singer and songwriter. His influence and popularity are significant, but he does not hold any political office or presidential aspirations. Mike Pence, on the other hand, was the Vice President of the United States from 2017 to 2021. Given this context, it is highly improbable that Justin Bieber would take over Mike Pence's position as Vice President in 2020 or any other time."
"Given the context, the correct answer is:

Mental disorders are often not hidden from others due to their observable effects on behavior, mood, and functioning. While individuals might attempt to conceal their symptoms, the presence of certain conditions can be recognized by those around them. Moreover, many mental health conditions have diagnostic criteria that healthcare professionals can use to identify them. Therefore, it is not feasible to completely hide a mental disorder from others."
"Given the context, Paul Bunyan's legendary attributes of immense size and strength are rooted in a mythological and fantastical narrative. Urban planning, on the other hand, is a practical and scientific field that requires a deep understanding of urban design, environmental sustainability, and community development. While Paul Bunyan's physical prowess might be impressive, it would not be directly applicable to the strategic and technical aspects of urban planning.

Therefore, the answer is:

(A) Yes"
"Yes, it is normal to find parsley in multiple sections of the grocery store. Fresh parsley is often found in the produce section, while dried parsley is typically located in the spice aisle.

Kurt Cobain's influence on the grunge music genre has endured after his death. Grunge, characterized by its raw, emotional sound and often politically charged lyrics, has had a lasting impact on popular music. Despite Nirvana's dissolution, the genre continues to be represented by various artists who carry on the grunge spirit. This includes bands like Foo Fighters, which emerged from the grunge scene, and other musicians who have incorporated elements of grunge into their work. Therefore, the music genre associated with Kurt Cobain's influence has continued to survive and evolve beyond his time."
"A spice grinder can still be useful for the cheapest cinnamon sticks, even if they are of lower quality.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"No, a slingshot would not be improperly classified as artillery. Artillery is typically defined by its size, power, and intended use in military operations, which a slingshot does not meet. Artillery is designed for long-range, high-impact firing, whereas a slingshot is a simple, handheld device used for short-range, low-impact launching of projectiles. Therefore, it is not classified as artillery."

"No, the Capricorn astrology symbol does not have all of the parts of a chimera. The Capricorn symbol is a combination of a goat's head and body, whereas a chimera is a mythical creature that typically features a composite body made up of different animals. Therefore, the Capricorn symbol does not match the description of a chimera."
"The Eurovision Song Contest is typically represented by a national broadcaster or a designated artist chosen by the country's music industry and government. Actress Dafne Keen, while talented, has not been selected to represent the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"Given the attributes of Iris and Hermes, we can analyze their suitability for a UPS job. Iris, as the goddess of the rainbow and messenger of the gods, is known for her swift and direct communication and her ability to move at high speeds. Hermes, the god of trade, commerce, and thievery, is also a messenger of the gods and is associated with speed, resourcefulness, and cunning.

In a UPS job, the primary responsibilities include handling packages, ensuring timely delivery, and managing inventory. Iris would excel in the speed and communication aspects, as she is known for her swift communication and ability to move quickly. However, Hermes might struggle with the more routine and detail-oriented tasks such as inventory management and customer service, which are crucial in a UPS job.

Therefore, while Iris and Hermes would likely complement each other in terms of speed and communication, Hermes might have a harder time with the more mundane and detail-oriented aspects of a UPS job.

The answer is:
(B) No"
"A: (A) No

Cookie Monster's diet, as depicted in the animated series, is not Paleo-friendly. The Paleo diet excludes foods such as grains, dairy, and processed sugars, which are common ingredients in cookies.

Lactic acid is a normal metabolic byproduct that occurs during intense physical activity, particularly in the absence of sufficient oxygen for aerobic respiration. While it can cause muscle fatigue and soreness, lactic acid is not inherently harmful. The body efficiently manages and eliminates lactic acid through various metabolic processes. In fact, lactic acid serves a crucial role in energy production and muscle function. However, excessive accumulation of lactic acid can lead to discomfort and fatigue."
"The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was aimed at assassinating King James I and the English nobility, but it did not directly eliminate Mary, Queen of Scots' bloodline. Mary, Queen of Scots, was executed in 1587, and her daughter, Elizabeth of Knole, was born in 1585 and died in 1586. Therefore, the correct answer to the question ""Did the Gunpowder plot eliminate Mary, Queen of Scots' bloodline?"" is:

(A) No"
"No, the main character of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"" Alice, is a fictional character and cannot join a Masonic Lodge, as Masonic Lodges are for real human members who meet specific criteria."
"To address the question of whether a bull shark bite hurts worse than a crocodile bite, we need to consider the nature and characteristics of both animals' bites.

Bull sharks are known for their aggressive behavior and are capable of delivering powerful bites. They are found in various coastal and river environments, which increases the likelihood of encounters with humans. The bites from bull sharks can be severe due to their powerful jaws and the potential for causing significant tissue damage, infection, and other complications.

Crocodiles, while also capable of delivering powerful bites, are generally more selective about their prey and are less likely to attack humans unless provoked or threatened. The severity of a crocodile bite can vary depending on the species and the size of the crocodile, but it is still a significant threat to human safety.

Given these factors, it is difficult to definitively state that one bite is worse than the other. Both can cause severe pain and injury. The severity of the injury would depend on various factors such as the size of the animal, the force of the bite, and the individual's response to the injury.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"
"(A) No

In the context of the fairy tale ""Snow White,"" the concept of consent is not applicable in the traditional sense. The narrative depicts a situation where Snow White is forced to leave her home by her parents and stepmother, rather than making a voluntary decision. Consent, in ethical and legal terms, requires a clear, voluntary, and informed agreement. Therefore, the story does not exemplify good consent."
"(A) No

Avengers Comics would not be out of place in a DC Comics store. Given the interconnected nature of superhero narratives in the comic book industry, it is not uncommon for characters from one company's universe to appear in the other's publications. This interconnectivity allows for a diverse range of stories and characters to coexist within the broader comic book market, making it plausible for Avengers Comics to be found in a DC Comics store."
"No, rhinoceroses have not been killed to improve human sex lives. The belief that rhinoceros horns are used for sexual enhancement is a myth. In reality, rhinoceros horns are primarily used in traditional medicine and as a status symbol, and their trade is heavily regulated due to conservation concerns. Killing rhinoceroses for these purposes is not only illegal but also unethical."
"A: (A) No

NFL players are not typically required to undergo infantry training. Their training focuses on the specific skills necessary for their sport, such as football techniques and physical conditioning. Infantry training is a different set of skills and is usually reserved for military personnel. While some NFL players may have prior military experience, this does not mean they receive infantry training as part of their professional football career."

"Given Brooke Shields' fame and public profile, it is reasonable to assume that she has the ability to succeed in a prestigious institution like the University of Pennsylvania. However, her academic achievements are not as well-documented as her public life. Without specific information about her performance at Penn, it's challenging to definitively say whether she would succeed academically.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the available information is:

(A) No

This answer acknowledges the lack of specific academic information about her performance at Penn, but it does not rule out the possibility of her success there."

To elaborate, facial hair, including a moustache, is a secondary sexual characteristic that typically develops during puberty. Puberty in males usually begins around the age of 12 to 14, and it is during this period that boys begin to grow facial hair. Since a baby is not yet in this developmental stage, it is highly unlikely for a baby to have a moustache."
"B) No

The Treaty of Versailles was not settled over blueberry scones. It was a significant international agreement signed in 1919 to formally end World War I and address the terms of peace, reparations, and territorial changes among the defeated Central Powers, primarily Germany. Blueberry scones are a dessert item and have no historical connection to the Treaty of Versailles."
"A customer would likely not be happy if their grocery store meat tasted like game. Most consumers expect meat to have a familiar and desirable flavor and texture, which is typically associated with domesticated animals rather than wild game. The distinct and often unappealing taste of game meat would generally lead to dissatisfaction and a negative shopping experience. Therefore, the correct answer is:

"No, you would not be likely to see storks at a baby shower. The association between storks and delivering babies is a cultural myth that has been popularized in various media, but it is not a common or expected element in modern baby shower celebrations. Baby showers typically focus on the expectant parents and involve decorations, games, and gifts that are more aligned with the joy and excitement of welcoming a new addition to the family."
"No, the Greek alphabet is not as common as Sumerian cuneiform. Sumerian cuneiform was a significant early writing system used by the Sumerians, but it is now primarily of historical interest. In contrast, the Greek alphabet has evolved into various forms and is widely used in modern languages, making it much more common today."

Secretariat was a thoroughbred racehorse known for winning the Triple Crown in 1973. Formula One is a motor racing competition, which is not a sport that horses participate in. Therefore, Secretariat did not win a Formula One championship."
"(B) Yes

A cattle farmer could indeed be useful to a drum maker in several ways. One of the most direct benefits is the availability of leather, which is a primary material used in drum making. Cattle farmers often have access to high-quality leather from their cattle, which can be processed into drum heads and other components. Additionally, if the cattle farmer has a workforce, they might be able to assist with tasks such as preparing the leather, cutting, and assembling drum parts. Furthermore, the farmer's network and connections could be valuable in sourcing other necessary materials or finding skilled labor for the drum-making process."
"No, Star Wars fans do not often say ""beam me up."" This phrase is more commonly associated with Star Trek fans. Star Wars fans are more likely to use phrases like ""May the Force be with you"" or ""Long live the Queen,"" which are iconic sayings from the Star Wars universe."

The correct answer depends on the specific context and cultural norms."
"(B) No

The Swiss Guard, while an impressive and well-trained group, is primarily tasked with protecting the Vatican and the Pope. Their duties are focused on ceremonial and security roles. The Virginia General Assembly, on the other hand, requires individuals who are knowledgeable about legislative processes, have the necessary qualifications, and are elected to serve in this capacity. Therefore, the Swiss Guard would not be able to fill the chairs in the Virginia General Assembly."
"No, placozoa do not get learning disabilities. This is because learning disabilities are a characteristic of complex nervous systems, which placozoa lack. They are simple organisms that do not have the necessary brain structures or cognitive functions to experience learning disabilities in the same way that humans or other animals do."

"To determine if a 500GB USB device is sufficient to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to consider the storage requirements for a single hour of Netflix content. Netflix typically streams content at a resolution of 1080p, which is a high-quality format. The size of a 1080p video file can vary, but generally, a single hour of high-quality video can range from 1.5GB to 3GB.

Taking the average size of a 1080p video file as 2.5GB, 10 hours of video would require:
\[ 10 \text{ hours} \times 2.5 \text{ GB/hour} = 25 \text{ GB} \]

Given that a 500GB USB device has a storage capacity of 500GB, it is more than sufficient to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day.

"To address the question of whether the torso is safe from blows to the largest and smallest bones in the body, we need to consider the anatomical locations and protective structures of these bones.

The largest bone in the torso is the sternum, which is protected by the rib cage. The rib cage, consisting of 12 pairs of ribs, provides a significant layer of protection for the sternum from external impacts.

On the other hand, the smallest bone in the body is the stapes, which is located in the middle ear. The stapes is protected by the temporal bone, which forms part of the outer and middle ear. This bone structure effectively shields the stapes from external impacts.

Given the protective structures of both the sternum and the stapes, it is reasonable to conclude that the torso is generally safe from blows to these specific bones. Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine whether a 1996 leap year baby would technically be 1 year old in 2000, we need to consider the nature of leap years and how age is calculated.

A leap year, such as 1996, includes February 29, which means that a person born on February 29 in a leap year technically ages one year on the next non-leap year, which is 1997. Therefore, in 2000, which is a leap year, the person would still be 3 years old, not 4.

Thus, the correct answer is:

(A) No"
"A: (A) No

In a hypothetical scenario, it is not unlikely for Mickey Mouse to make a purchase at Zazzle. While it is highly improbable for a specific character to engage in such an action, the concept of a character hypothetically making a purchase is not inherently impossible. Merchandise featuring Mickey Mouse is widely available, and fans and collectors often purchase such items. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that Mickey Mouse could hypothetically make a purchase at Zazzle."
"Yes, the answer is (A) Yes.

In the Chinese zodiac, each animal is associated with a specific year, and all of these animals are mammals. Mammals belong to the Chordata class, which includes animals such as rats, oxen, tigers, rabbits, dragons, snakes, horses, goats, monkeys, roosters, dogs, and pigs. Therefore, every animal in the Chinese zodiac is part of the Chordata class."
"No, a Halloween cruise in the Gulf of Mexico is not likely to be safe from storms. The Gulf of Mexico can experience various weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms, which can pose significant risks to a cruise. While the Gulf is generally less prone to hurricanes than the Atlantic, it is still possible to encounter stormy weather during the Halloween season. Therefore, it would be unwise to assume that a Halloween cruise in the Gulf of Mexico would be safe from storms."
"The statement that Phileas Fogg's around the world journey would be difficult to achieve during Pope John Paul I's reign is correct. Pope John Paul I's papacy was extremely brief, lasting only from August 26, 1978, to September 28, 1978. During this period, the global air travel network was not as developed as it is today. The fastest way to circumnavigate the globe at that time was by ship, and the journey would have taken significantly longer than the 80 days mentioned in Jules Verne's novel. Moreover, the infrastructure and technology for air travel were not as advanced, making it even more challenging to complete such a journey within a short timeframe. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Yes"
"(B) No

The Spice Girls are a British pop music group known for their performances and music, whereas ŽRK Kumanovo is a professional football club from North Macedonia.

"To address this question, we need to consider the scale and scope of both libraries. The Library of Alexandria, which existed from the 3rd century BC to the 5th century AD, was a significant repository of knowledge but was much smaller in terms of the number of items it housed compared to the Library of Congress.

The Library of Alexandria is estimated to have contained tens of thousands of scrolls, which would have required a considerable amount of space. However, the Library of Alexandria was primarily focused on papyrus scrolls, which are much larger in volume than modern books. The Library of Congress, on the other hand, houses a vast array of materials including books, manuscripts, maps, and other documents, totaling over 170 million items.

Given the sheer volume of materials housed in the Library of Congress, it is highly improbable that the Library of Alexandria would need less shelf space. Therefore, the answer is:

(A) No"
"(A) Yes

Paratroopers are indeed well-suited for mountain rescue operations. Their training in parachuting, high-altitude operations, and survival skills make them valuable assets in such missions.

Quiet from Metal Gear, despite her background in stealth and combat, possesses a level of intelligence and strategic thinking that could be valuable in various academic settings. While her expertise in espionage and military operations might not directly translate to a typical academic role, her problem-solving skills and ability to remain calm under pressure could make her an excellent lecturer in fields such as military history, intelligence studies, or even cybersecurity. Given that Haub College of Environmental Science focuses on environmental science and sustainability, her skills could still be applied in an interdisciplinary manner, making her a potential asset to the faculty."
"To address the question of whether more watermelons are grown in Brazil than in Antarctica, we need to consider the geographical and climatic conditions of both locations.

**Brazil**:
- It is a large country with diverse climates, including regions that are suitable for growing watermelons.
- Watermelons are indeed cultivated in Brazil, particularly in areas with warm temperatures and adequate rainfall.

**Antarctica**:
- This is the southernmost continent, covered by ice and snow.
- It experiences extremely cold temperatures and lacks sunlight for most of the year, making it unsuitable for growing any form of vegetation, including watermelons.

Given these conditions, it is evident that watermelons are not grown in Antarctica, whereas they are grown in Brazil. Therefore, more watermelons are grown in Brazil than in Antarctica.

**Answer: (A) No**"
"(A) No

SNL, or Saturday Night Live, is a television show known for its satirical content and comedic sketches. While it's possible that Jenny McCarthy and her cousin have personal disagreements, there is no direct link between her involvement with SNL and their relationship. Personal relationships are influenced by a variety of factors, including shared experiences, values, and interactions, rather than media appearances. Therefore, it is unlikely that SNL is the reason for any conflict between Jenny McCarthy and her cousin."
"Given the context, it would indeed be challenging to obtain toilet paper if there were no loggers.

Silverfish are small insects, typically reaching lengths of about 10-20 mm. Their climbing abilities are impressive, but they lack the physical capability to scale the Empire State Building, which stands at approximately 443 meters tall. The building's height, combined with its complex structure and lack of natural means for climbing, make it impossible for a silverfish to reach the top."
"No, someone could not theoretically use an armadillo as a shield. While an armadillo's shell is indeed a strong and protective feature, it is not suitable for human use for several reasons:

1. **Size and Weight**: The shell of an armadillo is relatively small and lightweight, which would not provide adequate protection for a human body.
2. **Mobility**: Armadillos are not designed to move quickly or maneuver in complex ways, making them impractical as a shield.
3. **Durability**: Although the shell is tough, it can be damaged or broken, leaving the user exposed.
4. **Versatility**: A human would need a shield that can be used in various situations, such as in a fight or confrontation, and an armadillo's shell is not versatile enough for these purposes.

"To determine whether Siri knows geometry, we need to consider the capabilities of virtual assistants like Siri. Siri, and other similar AI assistants, are designed to understand and respond to natural language queries based on pre-programmed responses and data. They can perform basic calculations and provide information on a wide range of topics, but they do not have the capability to understand or perform complex mathematical concepts like geometry.

Siri, like other virtual assistants, relies on external databases and APIs to provide information. For tasks requiring advanced mathematical knowledge, it would need to consult these resources. Therefore, while Siri can provide information about geometry, it does not inherently understand or perform geometry calculations itself.

A thousand dollars per episode for ""Days of Our Lives"" would be considered an unusually high production cost compared to other soap operas. Most soap operas, especially newer ones or those with different production models, have significantly lower per-episode budgets. The success of ""Days of Our Lives"" is more often attributed to its long-running history and dedicated fan base rather than its per-episode production costs."
"To address the question of whether black-tailed jackrabbits fear European wildcats, we need to consider the ecological and geographical contexts of these species.

Black-tailed jackrabbits are native to North America, while European wildcats are native to Europe. Given their geographical separation, it is unlikely that black-tailed jackrabbits would encounter European wildcats in their natural habitats. European wildcats are known to be predators of small mammals, including rabbits and hares, but there is no specific documented evidence of black-tailed jackrabbits exhibiting fear responses to European wildcats.

Predatory animals often exhibit behaviors such as running, hiding, or freezing in the presence of predators, but the specific fear response to European wildcats is not a widely documented trait for black-tailed jackrabbits. Therefore, based on the available information, it is reasonable to conclude that black-tailed jackrabbits do not fear European wildcats.

The answer is:
(B) No"

Wool can generally be machine washed, but it's important to handle it with care. While hand washing is an option, especially for delicate items or when extra care is needed, wool can also be safely machine washed using a gentle cycle and a wool or delicates detergent. It's crucial to avoid using fabric softeners, as they can damage the wool fibers. When washing, it's best to use a gentle cycle and a basin or sink with enough water to submerge the garment. After washing, thoroughly rinse the wool to remove any detergent residue. For drying, air-drying or using a low heat setting in a tumble dryer is recommended. Ironing can be done on a low heat setting, and it's advisable to use a pressing cloth to protect the fabric. Therefore, while hand washing is not necessary, it can be a suitable alternative for certain wool garments."
"To address this question, we need to compare the number of Imams Reza Shah believed in with the number of Jesus's disciples. Reza Shah, as a Shia Muslim, believed in 12 Imams, who are considered the successors to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. On the other hand, Jesus had 12 apostles, who were his closest followers and primary disciples.

Given these numbers:

"To determine whether you can watch ""Borgia's World of Wonders"" before ""Ludacris's Release Therapy"" finishes, we need to consider the current status of both shows. 

Without specific information about the current episode numbers or the exact time each show is scheduled to end, it's impossible to definitively say whether one show is still ongoing while the other has concluded. 

If ""Borgia's World of Wonders"" has already finished, then you can watch it before ""Ludacris's Release Therapy"" finishes. Conversely, if ""Ludacris's Release Therapy"" has not yet concluded, then you cannot watch ""Borgia's World of Wonders"" before it finishes.

Given the lack of specific information, the most accurate response is:

(A) No"
"To determine if all the unemployed people due to the 1933 Great Depression could fit in Tiger Stadium, we need to compare the number of unemployed individuals to the stadium's capacity.

1. **Tiger Stadium Capacity**: The seating capacity of Tiger Stadium is approximately 41,000 people.
2. **Number of Unemployed People**: During the 1933 Great Depression, the number of unemployed people in the United States was estimated to be around 15 million.

Given these figures, it is evident that 15 million people is significantly larger than the 41,000 seats available in Tiger Stadium.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Seismophobia, the fear of earthquakes, is a specific phobia that is typically associated with a fear of seismic activity. The role of Clerk of the Supreme Court of Canada involves administrative and legal duties, which are not directly related to seismic activity. Therefore, someone with seismophobia would not be at risk of harm in this profession. However, the phobia itself would still be a personal challenge that the individual would need to manage in their daily life."
"The question of whether Oscar Wilde's treatment under the law would be considered fair in the US now is complex and involves a comparison between historical legal standards and contemporary ones. In Wilde's time, homosexual acts were illegal and could result in severe legal penalties, including imprisonment and fines. However, in the modern US, the legal landscape regarding homosexuality has significantly changed. The US Supreme Court has ruled that laws criminalizing homosexual acts are unconstitutional, and same-sex marriage is now legal in all 50 states. Therefore, if Oscar Wilde were to be tried under modern US laws, he would not face the same legal consequences. 

Given this context, the answer is:

(B) No"

The correct answer is:

(B) No"
"To address the question regarding the evolutionary timeline of mongoose and rhinos, we need to consider their respective origins and the timeline of mammalian evolution.

Rhinos belong to the order Perissodactyla, which includes odd-toed ungulates. Fossil evidence suggests that rhinos have a long evolutionary history dating back to the Eocene epoch, approximately 56 million years ago. This places them among the oldest and most primitive of the large mammals.

Mongoose, on the other hand, are part of the family Herpestidae and are generally considered to be more recent in evolutionary terms. The mongoose family is thought to have evolved around 40-45 million years ago, which is relatively recent in the context of mammalian evolution.

Given this information, it is clear that the mongoose came from a later period than the rhinos.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) Yes"

"In Christian theology, the concept of Sheol, which is found in the Old Testament, is not directly referenced in the New Testament. Instead, the New Testament speaks of Hades, which is seen as a place of judgment and separation from God. Christians believe in the resurrection of the dead and the final judgment, with the ultimate destination being either heaven or hell. Therefore, Christians do not anticipate an existence in Sheol after death.

The Hundred Years' War, which lasted from 1337 to 1453, was a series of conflicts between the House of Lancaster in England and the House of Plantagenet in France. Since Cesare Borgia lived long after the end of the Hundred Years' War, he did not play a key role in that conflict. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"
"The United States Military Academy, or West Point, generally does not outright reject applicants with multiple sclerosis. However, the admissions process is highly competitive and involves a detailed evaluation. If an applicant has multiple sclerosis, they would need to provide medical documentation and undergo a thorough medical evaluation to determine their fitness for the rigorous training and physical demands of the academy. Therefore, while they might be considered, it is not guaranteed that an applicant with multiple sclerosis would be accepted. 

So, the correct answer to the question ""Would the United States Military Academy reject an applicant with multiple sclerosis?"" is:

"To determine if all the people who pass through 30th Street Station every day could fit in Dorton Arena, we need to consider the capacity of both locations.

1. **Estimating the number of people passing through 30th Street Station:**
   - 30th Street Station is a major transportation hub in Philadelphia, serving the SEPTA Broad Street Line.
   - On a typical weekday, it is estimated that around 100,000 to 150,000 people pass through the station.
   - On weekends, the number can be higher, potentially reaching 200,000 to 250,000 people.

2. **Capacity of Dorton Arena:**
   - Dorton Arena, located in North Carolina, has a seating capacity of approximately 10,000 people.

Given these figures, it is evident that the number of people passing through 30th Street Station every day (even on a weekend) is significantly larger than the capacity of Dorton Arena.

However, it does not have a widespread or significant association with death in any major culture. The perception of celery is more aligned with its health benefits and culinary uses."
"To address the question, we need to consider the principles of Ahimsa and the circumstances surrounding Paul the Apostle's death.

Ahimsa, a principle of non-violence and non-harm, is primarily associated with non-violent movements and practices in various religions, such as Jainism, Buddhism, and some forms of Christianity. It emphasizes the avoidance of causing harm to any living being.

Paul the Apostle, whose real name was Saul, was a Jewish Christian who later became a significant figure in the early Christian church. According to historical accounts, Paul was stoned to death in Rome around 64 AD. The cause of his death was not due to any violent act but rather as a result of a political decision to execute him.

Given this information, Paul's death did not violate the tenets of Ahimsa. Ahimsa is about avoiding harm and violence, and Paul's death was not a result of any violent act. It was a political decision to execute him, which is not in line with the principle of non-violence.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"

"To address the question about the number of smoggy days in Düsseldorf, it's important to consider the city's location and its environmental factors. Düsseldorf, situated in the Ruhr area, can indeed experience smoggy conditions, especially during certain seasons and weather patterns. However, the frequency and severity of these days can vary from year to year.

While Düsseldorf has made efforts to improve its air quality, the city still faces challenges related to industrial emissions and traffic. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Düsseldorf has only a small number of smoggy days each year.

However, if we consider the term ""Holy Land"" to refer to the region that is sacred to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and if we are referring to a specific historical or religious context, the answer would likely be:

(B) No

This is because the concept of the ""Holy Land"" is complex and has been subject to various interpretations and claims over time. Different religious and historical figures have had different perspectives on the territory that is considered sacred. Without specifying which Adamu's tribe and which Holy Land we are referring to, it's not possible to determine if the land was part of their territory."

"To determine whether a pear would sink in water, we need to consider the principle of buoyancy, which is governed by Archimedes' principle. This principle states that the upward buoyant force exerted on a body immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.

Fruits, including pears, are generally denser than water. The density of water is approximately 1 gram per cubic centimeter (g/cm³), and the density of a typical pear is around 0.6 to 0.8 g/cm³. Since the pear is denser than water, it will sink when placed in water. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Don King is a prominent figure in the boxing industry, known for his roles as a promoter and manager. While he has been involved in legal disputes and personal controversies, there is no substantial evidence that he has personally killed anyone.

Charles Manson, however, was a central figure in the Manson Family cult, which was responsible for several murders in 1969-1971. The most notorious of these was the Tate-LaBianca murders, where Manson's followers killed seven people, including actress Sharon Tate.

Given this information, it is evident that Charles Manson was directly responsible for the deaths of seven people in 1969-1971, whereas there is no evidence that Don King has personally killed anyone.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"

Pope Alexander VI, also known as Rodrigo Borgia, was a controversial figure during the Renaissance period. While some of his descendants held prominent positions in the Church, none of them were canonized by the Catholic Church. The process of canonization involves rigorous evaluation of a person's life and deeds, and it is not clear that any of Alexander VI's descendants met the stringent criteria set by the Church for sainthood."
"B: No

The Napoleonic Wars, which occurred from 1803 to 1815, were fought using conventional weapons.

"To determine if I could watch all of ""JAG"" in six months, we need to consider the total number of episodes and the average time it would take to watch them.

""JAG"" consists of 191 episodes. If I were to watch one episode per day, it would take 191 days to complete the series. 

Converting 191 days into months, we use the approximation that a month has about 30.44 days. Therefore, 191 days is approximately 191 / 30.44 ≈ 6.27 months.

Since 6.27 months is slightly more than 6 months, the answer is:

"To address the question, we need to compare the number of states in Ancient Greece with the number of states in the United States in 1900.

Ancient Greece is often considered to have had 13 city-states, which were independent city-states or poleis. These city-states included Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, and many others.

In 1900, the United States had 45 states. This number includes the original 13 colonies that formed the United States, plus the additional states that joined the Union after the American Revolution and the Civil War.

Comparing these two numbers:
- Ancient Greece: 13 states
- United States in 1900: 45 states

Clearly, the number of states in the United States in 1900 was significantly larger than the number of states in Ancient Greece.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No"

Christopher Columbus was an Italian explorer who lived from 1451 to 1506. He is famous for his voyages across the Atlantic Ocean, which led to the discovery of the New World for Europeans. However, he never visited Antarctica. The continent of Antarctica was not discovered until much later, in the late 19th century."
"To determine whether a sofer would be a bad job for a vegan, we need to consider the nature of the sofer's work and the principles of veganism. A sofer is responsible for writing or inspecting Torah scrolls, which are central to Jewish religious practice. The process of creating these scrolls often involves the use of materials that may not be vegan-friendly, such as parchment made from animal skin or ink that might contain gelatin.

Veganism, by definition, excludes the use of animal products and by-products, including materials derived from animals. Therefore, if a sofer's work involves using materials that are not vegan-friendly, it would be a bad job for a vegan. However, it is possible for a sofer to work with vegan-friendly materials and practices, which would make the job suitable for a vegan.

Given this information, the answer to whether a sofer would be a bad job for a vegan is:

(B) No

A sofer would not necessarily be a bad job for a vegan, provided they use only vegan-friendly materials and practices."

"The statement that having lip piercings leads to more expensive dental bills is not accurate. While lip piercings can sometimes cause oral health issues such as infections, gum inflammation, or damage to teeth, these issues do not directly correlate with increased dental expenses. The cost of dental bills would depend on the specific issues that arise from the piercings, not on the act of having a lip piercing itself. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"
"During the pandemic, door-to-door advertising can indeed be considered inconsiderate for several reasons. Firstly, it involves close physical contact, which increases the risk of transmitting the virus, especially to those who are more vulnerable. Secondly, the practice often requires individuals to gather in close proximity, which goes against the social distancing guidelines recommended to mitigate the spread of the virus. Additionally, the disruption caused by door-to-door canvassing can be seen as a violation of the public health measures implemented to protect communities. Lastly, the potential for discomfort or annoyance among residents, particularly those who are already dealing with stress and anxiety related to the pandemic, further justifies the consideration of door-to-door advertising as inconsiderate behavior. Therefore, the correct answer to the question ""During the pandemic, is door-to-door advertising considered inconsiderate?"" is:

(A) Yes"
"Alexander the Great, who lived from 356 BC to 323 BC, was not baptized. This is because the Christian practice of baptism was not introduced to the regions where Alexander lived until centuries after his time. Therefore, the correct answer is:

It is not impossible for Cheb Mami to win a Pulitzer Prize for musical composition. While the Pulitzer Prize is primarily awarded for literary works, there are other music-related awards that Cheb Mami could potentially win. Additionally, the Pulitzer Prize Board has the authority to award prizes in other categories, such as the Pulitzer Prize for Music Composition, which is given for a musical composition that has been premiered during the calendar year. Cheb Mami, a renowned Algerian singer and composer, has already won the Grand Prix du Disque and other prestigious awards, so his eligibility for a Pulitzer Prize is not entirely out of the realm of possibility."

The Golden Gate Bridge is a physical structure designed for vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It does not inherently produce audio, such as the sound of its own construction, traffic, or the environment around it. To create an MP3 from the Golden Gate Bridge, one would need to capture audio recordings of the bridge and its surroundings using microphones, but the bridge itself does not generate audio."
"To address the question, we need to consider the costs associated with each option:

1. **Running for President of India:**
   - The cost of running for President of India can vary widely. It includes campaign expenses, legal fees, security costs, and other administrative expenses. In India, the cost can range from a few million to tens of millions of Indian Rupees (INR) or more, depending on the candidate's resources and the scale of the campaign.

2. **Buying a new iPhone 11:**
   - The cost of a new iPhone 11 in India is approximately ₹70,000 (approximately $950 USD as of my last update).

Comparing these two costs, it is evident that the cost of running for President of India is significantly higher than the cost of buying a new iPhone 11. Therefore, the answer is:

"To address this question, we need to consider the family lineage of the Gracie brothers, who are pivotal in the history of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Carlos Gracie is known to have had 11 children, and Helio Gracie had 10 children. Adding these numbers together gives us a total of 21 children. 

A baker's dozen typically refers to 13 items, but it is often used informally to mean a quantity slightly more than 13. Therefore, the Gracie family having 21 children is more than a baker's dozen.

Thus, the answer is:

(B) Yes"
"Brooklyn is not specifically renowned for its bread products. While New York City is famous for its bagels, which are a type of bread, Brooklyn does not have a particularly strong reputation for bread production.

"No, quadragenarians do not necessarily have a diminished memory capacity. Memory can vary widely among individuals, and while age-related cognitive decline is a concern, it is not a universal characteristic of all individuals in their 40s. Factors such as lifestyle, genetics, and overall health can significantly impact cognitive function. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and cognitive activities, can help preserve memory and cognitive function throughout life."
"To determine whether Harry Potter or The Matrix was a better investment for Warner Bros., we need to consider several financial and market factors. Both franchises have been successful, but their returns can vary significantly.

The Harry Potter series has grossed over $7.7 billion worldwide, while The Matrix has grossed over $3.7 billion. Additionally, both franchises have generated substantial revenue through merchandise, streaming rights, and other ancillary products. Warner Bros. has a history of successfully investing in franchises that have long-term potential and broad appeal.

Given these factors, Warner Bros. likely saw value in both franchises. Therefore, it is not accurate to say one was definitively a better investment than the other.

The correct answer is:

"No, professional boxers do not typically expect to have low dental bills. The repetitive nature of boxing can lead to significant wear and tear on teeth and an increased risk of dental injuries such as chipped or broken teeth, jaw fractures, and other oral issues. These factors contribute to a higher likelihood of dental problems and, consequently, more frequent and costly dental treatments. Regular dental check-ups and proper oral hygiene are essential for boxers to manage these risks, but they still face a higher probability of dental issues compared to the general population."

The Great Recession, which began in 2007 and lasted until 2009, was indeed a significant economic downturn. However, it did not mark the period of the severest unemployment in history. The Great Depression, which occurred from 1929 to 1939, is generally considered to have been the period of the highest unemployment rates. During the Great Depression, unemployment rates in the United States reached as high as 25%, with some estimates suggesting that the unemployment rate could have been as high as 30% or even 35%. Therefore, the Great Recession was not the period of the severest unemployment."

"To address the question of whether Japanese serfdom had a higher status than English serfdom, it's important to consider the nature of both systems in their respective historical contexts.

In England, serfdom was a system where peasants were bound to the land and had limited rights. They were often required to work on the lord's land in exchange for protection and basic necessities. The status of serfs in England was generally lower than that of the nobility but higher than that of free peasants.

In Japan, the feudal system, known as the Bakufu system, was centered around the samurai class, who were warriors and not necessarily tied to the land in the same way as serfs in medieval England. The Japanese feudal system was more about military service and land grants, rather than a system of personal servitude. The status of the samurai was higher than that of the common peasants, but they were not bound to the land in the same way as serfs.

Given these differences, it would be inaccurate to say that Japanese serfdom had a higher status than English serfdom. The Japanese feudal system, while involving a form of dependency, was structured differently and did not have the same level of personal servitude as English serfdom.

Therefore, the answer is:

(A) No"

"To determine whether it would be very difficult for Nuno Gomes to dive to the Red Sea's deepest point, we need to consider the depth and the technical requirements for such a dive.

1. **Depth of the Red Sea's Deepest Point:**
   The Red Sea's deepest point, the Suez Trough, is approximately 4,267 meters (14,000 feet) below sea level.

2. **Technical Requirements for Diving to Such Depths:**
   Diving to such depths requires specialized equipment, including a pressurized diving suit or a submersible vehicle, as well as extensive training and experience. The pressure at 4,267 meters is extremely high, which makes it challenging and dangerous for a human to dive to such depths without the proper equipment and training.

3. **Nuno Gomes' Capabilities:**
   Nuno Gomes is a professional diver, but even professional divers have limitations. They typically dive to depths of around 30-40 meters (100-130 feet) for recreational dives, and even then, they require extensive training and experience. Diving to 4,267 meters would be far beyond the capabilities of a typical recreational diver.

Given these factors, it would be very difficult for Nuno Gomes to dive to the Red Sea's deepest point. Therefore, the correct answer is:
