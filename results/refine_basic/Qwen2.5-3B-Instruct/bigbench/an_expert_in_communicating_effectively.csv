"To solve this, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

Given these clues, let's deduce the arrangement:

- The flutist lives in house number 2.
- The pianist must be in either house number 3 or house number 4 (since there is one house between the flutist and the pianist).

Let's consider the pianist in house number 3:
- If the pianist is in house number 3, the guitarist must be in house number 2 (which is occupied by the flutist), which contradicts the requirement that the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips must be adjacent and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips.

Therefore, the pianist must be in house number 4:
- If the pianist is in house number 4, the guitarist must be in house number 3.

Now, we need to place the remaining flowers and instruments:
- The person with the bouquet of lilies must be in house number 1 (since house number 2 is occupied by the flutist and house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist).
- The person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 4 (since house number 4 is occupied by the pianist and house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist).

This leaves house number 1 for the person with the bouquet of lilies and house number 4 for the person with the carnations arrangement. The person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 2 (since house number 2 is occupied by the flutist and house number 3 is occupied by the guitarist).

Thus, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To determine the house where the cellist lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **The person who likes green lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Green

2. **The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.**
   - This means the person who only drinks water must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

4. **There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.**
   - This means the cellist and the person with a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

5. **The person who drinks root beer lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.**
   - This means the person who drinks root beer must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

6. **The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.**
   - House 1: Kiwis

Given these clues, let's deduce the arrangement:

- **House 1:** Kiwis (person who eats kiwis)
- **House 2:** Blue (person who likes blue) and Gameboy (person who has a gameboy)
- **House 3:** Root beer (person who drinks root beer) and Green (person who likes green)

Since the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3, and the person who drinks root beer must be to the left of the person who drinks root beer, the only possible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** Kiwis
- **House 2:** Blue, Gameboy
- **House 3:** Root beer, Green

Therefore, the cellist must live in house 2.

**The number of the house where the cellist lives is (B) 2.**"
"Given the constraints and the detailed analysis, we can deduce the following:

- The person who likes red lives in house 2.
- The person who likes kiwis lives in house 5.
- The person who likes oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes bananas.
- The person who likes white does not live in house 3.
- The person who likes blue lives directly to the right of the person who likes red (house 3).
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red (house 2).
- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue (house 3).
- The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes oranges (left of house 5).

Given these constraints, the person who likes green must live in house 1, as it is the only house left that fits all the conditions.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes green lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house (House 3).
2. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
9. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
11. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
12. **Clue 9**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the third house is house number 3.

Now, let's use Clue 11 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the root beer lover and the person who is eating mangos. Since the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be next to each other.

Given that the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the coffee drinker, and the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3 and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(C) 2**."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From these clues, we can place the people in the houses as follows:
- House 5: Person who only drinks water (Clue 4 and Clue 1)
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti (Clue 6)
- House 1: Person who had stew and the person who likes milk (Clue 7 and Clue 2)
- House 2: Person who likes milk (Clue 2 and Clue 3)
- House 4: Person who only drinks water (Clue 4 and Clue 1)

Since the person who only drinks water lives in house 5, and house 4 is already taken by the person who only drinks water, the only house left for the person who only drinks water is house 5.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is 5.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"To solve this, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges.

Combining Clues 1 and 4:
- The soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2.
- The person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges, which means the person eating oranges must be in house 1 and the person with daffodils must be in house 2.

Combining Clue 2:
- The swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2.
- Since the person with daffodils is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 1.

Combining Clue 3:
- The person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos.
- The person eating mangos must be in house 1 (since the swimmer is in house 1 and the person with daffodils is in house 2).

Thus, the person eating mangos must be in house 1, and the person with tulips must be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions of the individuals in the houses:

1. The violinist lives in House 1.
2. The history book buff lives in House 3.
3. The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 1.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.
5. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
6. The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone live directly next to each other.
7. The person who has a radio lives one house away from the history book buff.
8. The person with a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the percussionist.

From these constraints, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Violinist (since the violinist lives in the first house)
- House 3: History book buff (since the history book buff lives in the third house)
- House 2: Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone (since they live next to each other and the person with a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the percussionist, and the person with a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in House 3)

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist and the violinist is in House 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1. This leaves House 2 for the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips must live in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the first or third house.
3. **Clue 6:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. **Clue 5:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. **Clue 7:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
7. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the person who lives in the second house (Clue 2). This person is the mystery book reader.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: ?

Next, we use Clue 3 and Clue 6 to place the bird keeper and the fish enthusiast. The bird keeper cannot be in House 1 or House 3, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in House 3, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the history book buff. The history book buff must be directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the history book buff is in House 2, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 5 to place the percussionist. The percussionist must be directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the computer must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Next, we use Clue 7 to place the person who has a gameboy. The person who has a gameboy must be directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the gameboy is in House 2, the rose bouquet must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Finally, we use Clue 8 to place the cellist. The cellist cannot be in House 3. Since the cellist is not in House 3, the cellist must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the person who has a gameboy. The gameboy is in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy is directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the rose bouquet is in House 3, the gameboy must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. Therefore, the person driving a truck must live in house 1 because the person driving a truck is the only other car type left.

From Clue 1, since the person driving a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff, and the history book buff cannot be in house 1 (because the person driving a truck is in house 1), the history book buff must be in house 2. This means the person driving a convertible must be in house 1.

Now, we know:
- The person in house 1 (convertible driver) is not wearing boots, so they must be wearing sandals.
- The person in house 2 (truck driver) is not wearing boots, so they must be wearing boots.
- The person in house 1 (convertible driver) is not a history book buff, so they must be a mystery book reader.
- The person in house 2 (truck driver) is a history book buff.

Therefore, the person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff lives in House 4, and the mystery book reader lives in House 3.
   - House 3: Mystery book reader
   - House 4: History book buff

4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Mystery book reader
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 4: History book buff

5. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

From the remaining houses (1, 2, and 3), the only house left for the basketball player is House 2.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
2. The person wearing high heels does not live in the second or fourth house, so they must live in the first or third house. Since the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the person wearing high heels must live in the first house.
3. The person wearing high heels (first house) and the person wearing loafers (second house) must be to the right of each other, meaning the person wearing loafers must live in the fourth house.
4. The person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses. Since the first and fourth houses are occupied, the only remaining houses for the person wearing sandals and the romance book lover are the second and third. The person wearing sandals must live in the second house, and the romance book lover must live in the third house.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the person who likes yellow:
- Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2, they must be in either house 1 or house 3.

### Case 1: The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a gameboy must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who likes green).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

### Case 2: The person who likes yellow is in house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
2. The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
3. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
5. The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
6. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
7. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the third house. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and the tea drinker cannot be in the second house.

If the tea drinker is in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house numbers:

1. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (House 1).**
2. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house (House 1), so the fish enthusiast must live in House 2.**
3. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house (House 1), so the person who had pizza must live in House 2.**
4. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
   - Since the fish enthusiast (who likes green) lives in House 2, the person who has a radio must live in House 1.

From these deductions:
- **House 1:** Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- **House 2:** Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who likes green (in House 2) and the person who had pizza (in House 2) are already determined, the remaining characteristics are:
- The person who has a radio (in House 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in House 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in House 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in House 1.

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

1. The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.

4. The person who likes milk lives in either the third or fourth house.

11. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
12. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
13. The cat lover lives in the first house.

From Clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other, and since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Given that the person who only drinks water is in house 4, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 2 and 3. The person who likes milk must be in the third house. The person who is eating oranges must be in the second house.

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

From Clue 1, we know the first house has a phone. From Clue 2, the second house does not have boots. From Clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other.

Given these points:
- The first house (House 1) has a phone.
- The second house (House 2) does not wear boots.
- The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio must be in adjacent houses.

Since the first house has a phone, the second house must be the one with boots (as the second house does not wear boots). Therefore, the person in the first house must be wearing high heels and own a radio.

This leaves the second house to be the one with high heels and a dog (since the person in the first house has a phone and the person in the second house does not wear boots).

"To solve this problem, we need to match each person with their sport and pet based on the given clues:

### Clues Recap:
1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### Step 1: Identify the baseball player
From clue 3, we know the baseball player lives in the second house. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

#### Step 2: Identify the basketball player
From clue 1, the basketball player does not live in the first house. From clue 2, the basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Therefore, the basketball player must be in either House 1 or House 2. Since the baseball player is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

#### Step 3: Identify the swimmer
From clue 2, the basketball player (House 1) lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the basketball player is in House 1, the swimmer must be in House 2 or House 3. But since the baseball player is already in House 2, the swimmer must be in House 3. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: ?

#### Step 4: Identify the tennis player and cat lover
From clue 6, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the baseball player is in House 2 and the swimmer is in House 3, the tennis player must be in House 3 and the cat lover must be in House 4. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Basketball player
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cat lover

#### Step 5: Identify the fish enthusiast and bird keeper
From clue 4, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the cat lover is in House 4, the dog owner must be in House 3. So, the fish enthusiast must be in House 4. This leaves the bird keeper to be in House 1. So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Bird keeper
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cat lover

### Conclusion:
The bird keeper lives in House 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (D) 1."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them as follows:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. **Clue 4:** The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
5. **Clue 5:** The violinist does not live in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

From Clue 3, we know:
- The sedan and SUV owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The swimmer must live somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 7, we know:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's place the known elements:
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

Now, let's place the sedan and SUV:
- If the sedan is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (but house 2 is already taken by the baseball player).
- Therefore, the sedan must be in house 2, and the SUV must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

Now, we need to place the violinist and the white lover:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3.
- The white lover must be in house 1 or 3.

Since the white lover cannot be in house 1 (because the computer owner is there), the white lover must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 2 for the sedan owner.

Now, we need to place the guitarist and the gameboy:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the white lover (house 3), so the guitarist must be in house 3.
- The gameboy must be next to the sedan owner (house 2).

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

### Final Arrangement

- House 1: Computer owner
- House 2: Sedan owner
- House 3: Person who likes blue

The remaining characteristics:
- The white lover is in house 3.
- The guitar is in house 3.
- The gameboy is in house 2.
- The violinist is in house 2.
- The baseball player is in house 2.
- The soccer player is in house 1.

Thus, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The cat lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives.
8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 11, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1.

From Clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese (in house 1) lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. Therefore, the fish enthusiast must live in house number 2.

From Clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese (in house 1) lives directly left of the person who had fried rice. Therefore, the person who had fried rice must live in house number 3.

From Clue 2, the cat lover lives in house number 3. This contradicts Clue 5, so we need to reassess. Since the cat lover lives in house 3, the person who had fried rice must live in house 4.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. Since the person who had fried rice lives in house 4, the person who had pizza must live in house 5.

From Clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had fried rice lives in house 4, the person who had stew must live in house 3, but this contradicts Clue 2. Therefore, we need to reassess the positions.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had fried rice lives in house 4, the bird keeper must live in house 2, and the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 5.

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the bird keeper lives in house 2, the person who has a television must live in house 3, but this contradicts Clue 2. Therefore, we need to reassess the positions.

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a television lives in house 3, the person who owns horses must live in house 1, and the person who has a gameboy must live in house 5.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other. Since the person who had pizza lives in house 5, the person who has a phone must live in house 4.

Therefore, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with a phone
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Person who had fried rice
- House 4: Person who had pizza
- House 5: Person who has a gameboy

The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1.

- **Person eating kiwis (K)** is to the left of **Person wearing boots (B)**.
- **Person wearing high heels (H)** and **Person with a radio (R)** are next to each other.
- **Person eating oranges (O)** is directly left of **Person with a television (T)**.

- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)

Let's assume the person who is eating apples lives in House 2:

- House 2: Person who is eating apples

- House 1: Person who likes red
- House 5: Person who is eating kiwis

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the person who likes milk is in House 3, the person who owns an SUV must be in House 4 or House 5.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:
- **House 1: Soccer player**
- **House 3: Person who is eating kiwis**
- **House 2: Not apples eater**
- **House 4: Not oranges eater**
- **House 5: Not science fiction book fanatic**

Given the constraints, the only house left for the apples eater is **House 5**.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in **House 5**.

The correct answer is (C) 5."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- **House 1**: Yellow (loves yellow, has lilies, wears boots)
- **House 2**: History book buff (loves blue, has daffodils)
- **House 3**: Science fiction book fanatic (loves green, has lilies, wears high heels)

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house number 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. The cricketer lives in house 1.
2. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the sedan owner.
3. The horse owner lives directly left of the sedan owner.
4. The truck driver lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.

Let's place the people in the houses:

- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Cat lover (C)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)

Since the cat lover (C) must be adjacent to the sedan owner (S), and the horse owner (H) lives directly left of the sedan owner (S), the horse owner (H) must be in house 1, which contradicts the cricketer being in house 1. Therefore, the horse owner (H) must be in house 2, and the cat lover (C) must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Horse owner (H)
- House 3: Cat lover (C)

Since the truck driver (T) lives in house 3, the basketball player (B) must live in house 2.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who has a radio lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.

7. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.
8. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
9. The person who has a bouquet of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
10. The person who has a television does not live in the second house.

17. The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
18. The percussionist lives directly left of the cat lover.
19. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 4: Radio
- House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 3: Percussionist
- House 5: Guitarist

Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist, and the saxophonist cannot be in the first three houses (as the fish enthusiast is in the first house and the percussionist is in the third house), the saxophonist must be in the fourth house, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in the fifth house.

Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in **House 5**.

The correct answer is (E) 5."
"To determine the house where the person who owns a sedan lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The tea drinker lives in house 4.
2. The saxophonist lives in house 2.
3. The pizza eater lives in house 3 (since they are to the right of the saxophonist).
4. The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
5. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
6. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
7. The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
8. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. The flutist does not live in the fourth house.
10. The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.

From clue 8, the pizza eater (house 3) must be to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the pizza eater is in house 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

From clue 7, the cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the pizza eater is in house 3, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 4.

From clue 1, the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk. Since the pizza eater is in house 3, the person who likes milk must be in house 4 (but the tea drinker is already in house 4), so the person who likes milk must be in house 2, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1.

From clue 6, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers. Since the person who is wearing sandals is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 2, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 3.

From clue 5, the cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who ate fried rice is in house 4, the cellist must be in house 3.

Therefore, the cellist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To determine the house where the person who drives a truck lives, let's re-evaluate the clues with a structured approach:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
6. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

Given that the minivan driver lives in house 4 (Clue 9), we can deduce the following:

- **House 4 (Minivan driver):** Root beer lover.
- **House 3 (Root beer lover):** Root beer lover.
- **House 2 (Swimmer):** The swimmer must be to the left of the sedan owner, and the sedan owner must be to the left of the truck driver. Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 2.
- **House 1 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 1.
- **House 2 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 2.
- **House 1 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 1.
- **House 3 (Root beer lover):** The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- **House 4 (Minivan driver):** The minivan driver lives in house 4.
- **House 2 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 2.
- **House 1 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 1.
- **House 3 (Root beer lover):** The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- **House 4 (Minivan driver):** The minivan driver lives in house 4.
- **House 2 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 2.
- **House 1 (Swimmer):** The swimmer lives in house 1.
- **House 3 (Root beer lover):** The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- **House 4 (Minivan driver):** The minivan driver lives in house 4.

From the above, we can see that the truck driver must be in house 1, as house 1 is the only house left for the truck driver to live in, given the constraints.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(A) 1**."
"To determine the house where the coffee drinker lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 1, the tea drinker is in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.
- From Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.
- From Clue 5, the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's test the possible positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1 (Clue 5), then the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

Given Clue 4, the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following house assignments:

1. **Clue 5** states that the person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 2** indicates that the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the SUV owner is in house 3, the person in house 2 must be the mystery book reader, and the person in house 1 must be the person who drives a convertible.
3. **Clue 3** suggests that the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV owner is in house 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 2. But house 1 is already taken by the person who drives a convertible, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.
4. **Clue 4** states that the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who drives a convertible is in house 1, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 2.
5. **Clue 6** indicates that the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner. Since the person who drives a minivan is in house 2 (as the person who is eating mangos is in house 2), the dog owner must be in house 3.
6. **Clue 7** mentions that there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives. Since the person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (as house 1 and 2 are taken), the bird keeper must be in house 2.
7. **Clue 8** states that the bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the bird keeper is in house 2, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.
8. **Clue 9** indicates that the person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other. Since the person who drives a minivan is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1.
9. **Clue 10** states that the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 1, the romance book lover must be in house 4.
10. **Clue 11** states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house 1 and the person who is eating grapes is in house 4, this clue is consistent with the current arrangement.

Given all these clues, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Person who drives a convertible
- House 2: Person who is eating mangos
- House 3: Person who owns an SUV
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

"To determine the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast.

2. **Clue 6**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.
   - This means the person eating apples and the person wearing boots must be in houses 2 and 4 or 1 and 3.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the person eating apples must live in either the first or the fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the mangos and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 3**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the apples and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 2**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in either the fourth house or the fifth house (but since there are only 4 houses, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth house).

7. **Clue 1**: The history book buff lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the history book buff must live in the second house.

8. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
   - Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house, the person eating a banana must live in either the fourth or the fifth house. But since there are only 4 houses, the person eating a banana must live in the fourth house.

Now, let's summarize the information:
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- Second house: History book buff.
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic (from Clue 2 and Clue 6).
- First house: Person eating mangos (from Clue 5 and Clue 3).
- Fourth house: Person eating a banana (from Clue 8).
- Fifth house: Person eating apples (from Clue 4 and Clue 3).

Since the person eating apples must live in either the first or the fourth house, and the fourth house is already occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the person eating apples must live in the first house.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house (number 1). Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house (number 2).
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house (number 2). Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house (number 1).
3. The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the flutist lives in the first house (number 1), the person who likes white must live in the second house (number 2).
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house (number 2), the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house (number 1).

From these deductions, we can conclude that the person who is wearing sandals must live in the second house (number 2).

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is **2**."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. The root beer lover lives in house 3.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in house 2.
3. The person who drives a minivan lives in house 1.
4. The person who owns a sedan lives in house 1 (since the sedan owner cannot be in house 1, and the sedan owner must be directly left of the person with the bouquet of daffodils, which is in house 2).
5. The person with the bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.
6. The cellist lives in house 1 (since the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist, and the saxophonist must be in house 2).
7. The person who owns a sedan lives in house 1 (since the sedan owner must be directly left of the person with the bouquet of daffodils, which is in house 2).
8. The person who is eating apples lives in house 2 (since the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist, and the violinist must be in house 3).
9. The person who is eating apples lives in house 2.
10. The person who is eating mangos lives in house 1 (since the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples, and the sedan owner is in house 1).

Therefore, the violinist must live in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. House 3: Not boots, not yellow, not stew.
2. House 2: High heels.
3. House 4: Blue, loafers, not white.
4. House 5: Grilled cheese, not red, not stew.
5. House 6: Not white, not red, not stew.

From Clue 14, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers. Since the loafers must be to the right of the cat lover, and the cat lover must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is already occupied by high heels, the cat lover must be in house 1. Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 5.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

The correct answer is (E) 5."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the first house (house 1) has a television. Therefore, the second house (house 2) must have the computer, as there is only one computer and one television.

Given that the person in the first house has a television, the person in the second house must have the computer.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic (SFF) lives somewhere to the left of the golfer (Golfer).
   - This means SFF is in House 1 and Golfer is in House 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) live directly next to each other.
   - This means PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses. Since Golfer is in House 2, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist (G) lives somewhere to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils (D).
   - This means G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D. Since Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

Given these constraints, let's fit the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 2 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their corresponding devices:

1. **House 1: Dog owner (Clue 2)**

2. **House 2: Phone (Clue 9)**

3. **House 3: Television (Clue 8)**

4. **House 4: Violinist (Clue 8)**

5. **House 5: Bird keeper (Clue 10)**

Now, we need to place the remaining people and devices:
- **Clue 3**: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 4**: The flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television.
- **Clue 6**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
- **Clue 7**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
- **Clue 5**: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
- **Clue 1**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
- **Clue 2**: The dog owner does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 8**: The violinist lives in the fourth house.

Given the constraints, let's place the remaining people and devices:
- **House 1: Dog owner**
- **House 2: Phone**
- **House 3: Television**
- **House 4: Violinist**
- **House 5: Bird keeper**

Now, we need to place the remaining people and devices:
- **Clue 3**: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 4**: The flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television.
- **Clue 6**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
- **Clue 7**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
- **Clue 5**: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
- **Clue 1**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
- **Clue 2**: The dog owner does not live in the second house.
- **Clue 8**: The violinist lives in the fourth house.

By placing the remaining people and devices, we can deduce:
- **House 1: Dog owner**
- **House 2: Phone**
- **House 3: Television**
- **House 4: Violinist**
- **House 5: Bird keeper**

The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Given the constraints, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2. This leaves the flutist and the person who has a gameboy to be placed in houses 2 and 3. Since the flutist lives directly left of the person who has a television, the flutist must be in house 2 and the person who has a television in house 3. The person who has a gameboy must be in house 4, and the percussionist must be in house 5.

Thus, the percussionist lives in **House 5**.

The correct answer is:
(C) 5"
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.

From Clue 3, we know that the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. Let's denote the houses as follows:
- House 1: Lilies
- House 2: Unknown

From Clue 4, the basketball player cannot live in house 1. Therefore, the basketball player must live in house 2.

Now, let's consider Clue 1 and Clue 2 together. Since the person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist, the person eating apples must be to the left of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must live in house 1, and the violinist must live in house 2.

To summarize:
- House 1: Lilies (person with the bouquet of lilies)
- House 2: Unknown (person eating apples, violinist, or basketball player)

Since the basketball player cannot be in house 1, and the violinist must be in house 2, the violinist must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to match each person with their sport and lunch, and then determine the house number where the cricketer lives. Let's break down the clues and use logical deduction to find the solution.

### Clues Recap:
1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Tennis Player (3rd house):**
   - Tennis player lives in the 3rd house.

2. **Grilled Cheese (5th house):**
   - Grilled cheese lives in the 5th house.

3. **Golfer (4th house):**
   - Golfer lives in the 4th house.

4. **Stew and Spaghetti (1 house between them):**
   - Let's denote the person who had stew as \( S \) and the person who ate spaghetti as \( Sp \).
   - Since there is one house between \( S \) and \( Sp \), the possible positions for \( S \) and \( Sp \) are:
     - \( S \) in the 2nd house and \( Sp \) in the 4th house (but the 4th house is occupied by the golfer).
     - \( S \) in the 1st house and \( Sp \) in the 3rd house.
     - \( S \) in the 3rd house and \( Sp \) in the 5th house (but the 5th house is occupied by grilled cheese).
     - \( S \) in the 2nd house and \( Sp \) in the 5th house (but the 5th house is occupied by grilled cheese).
     - \( S \) in the 1st house and \( Sp \) in the 4th house (but the 4th house is occupied by the golfer).
     - \( S \) in the 1st house and \( Sp \) in the 2nd house.
   - The only valid positions are \( S \) in the 1st house and \( Sp \) in the 3rd house.

5. **Stew (1st house) and Spaghetti (3rd house):**
   - Stew lives in the 1st house.
   - Spaghetti lives in the 3rd house.

6. **Person who had pizza (left of cricketer):**
   - The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.

7. **Tennis player (3rd house) and Soccer player (left of tennis player):**
   - The tennis player lives in the 3rd house.
   - The soccer player must live to the left of the tennis player, so the soccer player could be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd house. Since the 3rd house is occupied by the tennis player, the soccer player must be in the 1st or 2nd house.

8. **Remaining positions:**
   - The remaining houses are 2, 4, and 5.
   - The golfer is in the 4th house.
   - The grilled cheese is in the 5th house.
   - The cricketer must live in the 2nd or 5th house, but the 5th house is occupied by grilled cheese.

9. **Final positions:**
   - Stew (1st house)
   - Cricketer (2nd house)
   - Soccer player (1st house, but it's already occupied by stew)
   - Tennis player (3rd house)
   - Golf (4th house)
   - Pizza (2nd house, left of cricketer)
   - Spaghetti (3rd house)

Thus, the cricketer lives in the 2nd house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the clues provided:

1. The person wearing running shoes does not live in the first house, so they must live in the second house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, so the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other, confirming the previous information.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other, which is consistent with the previous information.

From this, we can deduce:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water, Person who likes white
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (from house 1), Person who ate spaghetti, Person who likes red, Person who plays baseball, Person who wears loafers

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

The correct answer is **(A) 2**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as A, B, and C, corresponding to the houses 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either house 1 or house 3.

**Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the person eating oranges must live in either house 1 or house 3.

**Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. If the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.

**Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means if the coffee drinker is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 3. If the coffee drinker is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 3).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 2).

This configuration does not work because the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2.

- If the root beer lover is in house 3:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their characteristics:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"To determine the house where the cricketer lives, let's summarize the information and deduce the characteristics of each person based on the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating kiwis
   - House 2: Eating apples

2. **Clue 4:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

3. **Clue 5:** The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not dog owner
   - House 2: Dog owner

From Clue 5, we know the dog owner lives in House 2. Therefore, the person in House 1 is not the dog owner.

4. **Clue 2:** The bird keeper and the person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.
   - House 1: Bird keeper or high heels
   - House 2: High heels or bird keeper

Since the person in House 1 is not the dog owner, the bird keeper must be in House 1 and the person wearing high heels must be in House 2.

5. **Clue 3:** The tennis player and the person eating apples live directly next to each other.
   - House 1: Tennis player or eating apples
   - House 2: Tennis player or eating apples

Since the person in House 1 is the bird keeper and the person in House 2 is the dog owner, the tennis player must be in House 1 and the person eating apples must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 1:** The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating kiwis
   - House 2: Eating apples

Now we have:
- House 1: Bird keeper, eating kiwis
- House 2: Dog owner, eating apples

Since the tennis player and the person eating apples live next to each other in House 1, and the tennis player is in House 1, the person eating apples must be in House 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Bird keeper, eating kiwis
- House 2: Dog owner, eating apples

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is the bird keeper and eating kiwis.
- The person in House 2 is the dog owner and eating apples.
- The tennis player and the person eating apples live next to each other in House 1, so the tennis player must be in House 1.
- The person in House 2 is the dog owner and eating apples.
- The person in House 1 is the bird keeper and eating kiwis.
- The person in House 2 is the dog owner and eating apples.
- The person in House 1 is the tennis player and the person in House 2 is the cricketer.

Therefore, the cricketer must live in House 2.

The number of the house where the cricketer lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."

   - The bird keeper lives two houses away from the person who ate spaghetti. Given the positions, the bird keeper must be in the fifth house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first house.

8. **Fried rice not in the first house (Clue 3):**
   - Fried rice must be in houses 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the second and fourth houses are occupied, fried rice must be in the third house.

9. **Grilled cheese and pizza next to each other (Clue 1):**
   - The grilled cheese and pizza must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since the third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice, the grilled cheese must be in the first house.

10. **Cat lover and fish enthusiast next to each other (Clue 2):**
    - The cat lover must be in the first house, and the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.

11. **Two houses between spaghetti and bird keeper (Clue 6):**

The answer is (B) 4."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes green lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
3. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.
5. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
6. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red.
7. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

12. The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.

From these clues, we can determine the following:

- House 4: Fried Rice

Further analysis shows:

- House 2: Mangos (had pizza)
- House 3: Rose Bouquet
- House 3: Red (or Carnations)
- House 4: Apples

Given that the person who had pizza (House 2) and the person who has a rose bouquet (House 3) live directly next to each other, and the person who likes blue (House 2) and the person who owns an SUV (House 3) live directly next to each other, we can conclude:

- House 2: Mangos (had pizza)
- House 3: Red (or Carnations)
- House 3: Rose Bouquet
- House 4: Apples

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Based on the clues provided:

1. The person eating grapes does not live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person driving a convertible lives in the second house.

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The baseball player lives in the second house.
- The person driving a convertible also lives in the second house.
- Therefore, the person eating grapes must live in the second house.
- Consequently, the person eating mangos must live in the first house.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
2. Since the person who likes blue is to the left of the person who is eating kiwis, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the first house.
3. The person who is eating apples must be in the first house as well, since the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.
4. The person who likes white must be in the third house, as they live somewhere to the right of the person who likes green, and the person who likes green is in the first house.

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1 because the root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person with the rose bouquet, and there is no house 3.
2. The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader, so they must be in adjacent houses. Since the person with the gameboy is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
3. The person with the gameboy is in house 1, and the mystery book reader is in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the people as Cat Lover, Fish Enthusiast, Horse Owner, and Dog Owner.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**From Clue 4:**
- The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
- This means the fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 2:**
- There are two houses between the truck and the dog owner.
- This means the truck and the dog owner cannot be in the first or last house. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

**From Clue 3:**
- The truck lives directly left of the sedan.
- This means the truck and the sedan must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 1:**
- The minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
- This means the minivan cannot be in the first house.

**From Clue 5:**
- The cat lover does not live in the second house.
- This means the cat lover must live in either the first or the fourth house.

### Combining Clues:

Let's test the possible positions for the dog owner and the truck:

1. **Dog owner in house 3:**
   - Truck must be in house 2 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 4 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 2 and the dog owner is in house 3).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration works:
   - House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
   - House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
   - House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
   - House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

2. **Dog owner in house 4:**
   - Truck must be in house 3 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 2 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 3 and the dog owner is in house 4).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 5).

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:
- House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
- House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
- House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - This means the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

2. **Clue 4**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water.

3. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3.

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3.

Given these constraints, let's place the people in the houses:
- House 1: Only drinks water (let's call this person ""W"")
- House 2: Likes root beer (let's call this person ""R"")
- House 3: Likes yellow (let's call this person ""Y"")
- House 4: Likes blue (let's call this person ""B"")

Since the person who likes blue (B) must be in a house number greater than 3, and the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3, the only possible house for the person who likes blue is House 4.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"To determine the house where the bird keeper lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house (house 2).
2. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
3. **Clue 2**: The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
4. **Clue 3**: The person eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
5. **Clue 4**: The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
6. **Clue 5**: The person wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
7. **Clue 7**: The person wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

Given Clue 6, we know:
- House 2: Person who likes blue.

Given Clue 5, the person wearing sandals must be in house 3 (since house 2 is taken by the person who likes blue).

Given Clue 4, the dog owner must be in house 1 (since house 2 is taken by the person who likes blue and house 3 is taken by the person wearing sandals).

Given Clue 2, the baseball player must be in house 1 (since house 1 is taken by the dog owner).

Given Clue 3, the person eating grapes must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the person wearing sandals).

Given Clue 1, the cricketer must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the person eating grapes).

Given Clue 7, the person wearing loafers must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the person eating grapes).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Dog owner, Baseball player
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals, Person eating grapes, Person wearing loafers

The person who likes white (the only color left) must be the bird keeper, and since the bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (as house 1 is taken by the dog owner and baseball player), the bird keeper must be in house 3.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who owns horses lives in the first house.
2. The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
3. The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.
4. The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker, so the cellist lives in the fourth house.
5. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk, so the root beer lover lives in the first house and the person who likes milk lives in the second house.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer, so the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the third house.
7. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, and the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.
8. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
10. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover, so the guitarist lives in the second house.
11. The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper, and there is one house between the pianist and the bird keeper, so the pianist lives in the third house and the bird keeper lives in the fourth house.
12. The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper, so the tennis player lives in the third house.

From the above deductions, the tennis player lives in the third house. Therefore, the number of the house where the tennis player lives is 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"To determine the house where the history book buff lives, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
2. **Clue 2**: The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
3. **Clue 3**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.

13. **Clue 13**: There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

From Clue 7, we know the person who likes blue lives in House 5.

From Clue 8, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white, and from Clue 9, the cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Therefore, the order of these three is:
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 2: White

From Clue 1, the person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player. Since the tennis player must be in House 3 (from Clue 8), the person who is eating kiwis must be in House 2.

From Clue 10, there are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives. Since the tennis player is in House 3, the romance book lover must be in House 1.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating a banana does not live in the fifth house. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes blue, the person who is eating a banana must be in House 4.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives. Since the person who is eating mangos cannot be in House 4 (Clue 5) and the person who likes green cannot be in House 5 (Clue 7), the person who is eating mangos must be in House 2, and the person who likes green must be in House 4.

From Clue 13, there are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the romance book lover is in House 1, the mystery book reader must be in House 3.

Thus, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 2, and the person who likes green lives in House 4. The history book buff must live in House 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the history book buff lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, we know that the cellist and the person with the gameboy are neighbors, and the cellist is to the left of the person with the gameboy. This means the cellist and the gameboy owner must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 2, the dog owner cannot be in the first house, so the dog owner must be in the second house.

Given these constraints, the only possible arrangement is:
- Cellist in house 1
- Gameboy owner in house 2

This leaves house 1 for the dog owner.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **1**."
"To determine the house where the person who owns an SUV lives, let's systematically analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person with a phone and the person with an SUV must be adjacent, and the phone must be to the left of the SUV.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be adjacent to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 2: Phone
- House 4: SUV

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

1. **Clue 6**: The person who has a computer lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Computer

2. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Tulips

3. **Clue 7**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - This means the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement must be in adjacent houses. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Since the computer is in house 2, the adjacent houses for the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement are houses 1 and 3, or 3 and 4. Since house 3 already has tulips, the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 3. But since house 2 already has a computer, the only possible pair is houses 1 and 4.

   - House 1: Rose bouquet
   - House 4: Carnations arrangement

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the daffodils and radio must be in houses 4 and 5, or 3 and 4, or 2 and 3, or 1 and 2, or 1 and 3. Since house 1 already has a rose bouquet and house 3 has tulips, the only possible pair is houses 2 and 5.

   - House 2: Computer
   - House 5: Daffodils

5. **Clue 1**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
   - This means the lilies and phone must be in houses 3 and 4, 4 and 5, or 2 and 3, or 1 and 2, or 1 and 3. Since house 3 already has tulips and house 4 has daffodils, the only possible pair is houses 2 and 3.

   - House 2: Computer
   - House 3: Tulips
   - House 4: Daffodils
   - House 5: Lilies

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a television.
   - This means the phone and television must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. Since house 2 already has a computer, the only possible pair is houses 1 and 3.

   - House 1: Phone
   - House 3: Tulips
   - House 2: Computer
   - House 4: Daffodils
   - House 5: Lilies

7. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.
   - This is already satisfied as house 4 has daffodils.

### Conclusion:
The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 4.

Thus, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- **House 1:** Bird Keeper
- **House 2:** Cricketer, Loafers
- **House 3:** Horses, Dog Owner
- **House 4:** Cat Lover, Golfers
- **House 5:** Running Shoes, Baseball Player

From this arrangement, the dog owner lives in **House 3**.

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person:

1. **Radio and Truck**: The person with the radio and the person driving the truck live next to each other.
2. **Radio and Pizza**: The person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.
3. **Root Beer Lover**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house (house 1).
4. **Grapes and Computer**: The person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with the computer.

Given these clues, let's break it down step by step:

- Since the root beer lover does not live in house 1, they must live in house 2.
- The person eating grapes must live directly left of the person with the computer, so the computer must be in house 1 and the grapes in house 2.
- The person with the radio must live to the left of the person who had pizza, and they must live next to each other.

From the above deductions:
- The person eating grapes is in house 2.
- The person with the computer is in house 1.
- The person with the radio is in house 1 (since they must be next to the person with the pizza and the pizza person must be in house 1).

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is **1**.

So, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
4. The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
5. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
7. The person who likes green does not live in the first house.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

From these clues, we can place the tea drinker in House 1. Since the tea drinker is in House 1, the pizza eater must be in House 2 (Clue 5). The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses (Clue 4). Given that the tea drinker is in House 1, the only possible adjacent houses for the white liker and the water drinker are Houses 2 and 3. Since the pizza eater is in House 2, the white liker and the water drinker must be in Houses 2 and 3. Therefore, the water drinker must be in House 2 and the white liker in House 3.

Next, the person who ate spaghetti must be to the left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 6). Since the water drinker is in House 2, the spaghetti eater must be in House 3, and the person who only drinks water must be in House 4.

Finally, the person who likes green cannot be in House 1 (Clue 7) and cannot be in House 4 (Clue 8). Therefore, the person who likes green must be in House 3.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes white lives in the third house (Clue 12).
2. The person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house (Clue 1).
3. The dog owner lives in the third house (Clue 4).

12. The person who likes white lives in the third house (Clue 12).
13. The fish enthusiast lives in the first house (Clue 13).

From Clue 12, the person who likes white lives in the third house. From Clue 11, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. Since there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives, the person who likes red must live in the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is (C) 2."
"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in House 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses as follows:

1. The soccer player lives in house number 3.
2. The golfer and the basketball player are adjacent and the golfer is to the left of the basketball player. This means they must be in houses 1 and 2.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5), they must be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese (in house 2) lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. The pianist lives in the third house.

8. There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
9. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
10. The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
11. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
12. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. This is a contradiction because Clue 7 states the person who likes red lives in the third house. Therefore, we need to reassess the clues.

Given Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. This means Clue 7 is incorrect, and the person who likes red does not live in the third house.

Let's reassign the remaining houses:

- The third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.
- The fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.
- The fifth house is occupied by the person who likes red.

Now, let's place the remaining people:

- The first house is occupied by the person who likes blue.
- The second house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.
- The person who had pizza must be to the right of the person who likes yellow.
- The person who likes white must be two houses away from the person who likes yellow.
- The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.

Given the constraints, the only consistent placement is:

- First house: Person who likes blue.
- Second house: Person who likes yellow.
- Third house: Person who ate fried rice.
- Fourth house: Person who ate spaghetti.
- Fifth house: Person who likes red.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"To determine the house where the person wearing running shoes lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - This means the tea drinker is in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the root beer lover lives in a house with a higher number than the person who is wearing sandals.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes lives in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 2, 3, or 4.

Given that the tea drinker is in house 3, we can deduce:
- House 1: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)
- House 2: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)
- House 4: Not grilled cheese (from Clue 7)

Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1, 2, or 4, the only option left is house 1. So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 1.

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker

Since the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 4), the only option left for the person who only drinks water is house 4.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Only drinks water

This leaves house 2 for the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had stew must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 2), the person who had stew must be in house 1, which is already occupied by the grilled cheese eater.

So, the only remaining option for the person who had stew is house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Stew
- House 3: Tea drinker
- House 4: Only drinks water

This leaves house 4 for the person who is wearing running shoes (Clue 5). The person who is wearing running shoes must be in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew (Clue 5), and the only option left is house 4.

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 4.

From Clue 10, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and since the person who is wearing high heels lives in the fifth house, the person who likes milk must live in the fourth house. From Clue 9, the person who has a computer lives directly next to the person who has a gameboy. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the second house, and the person who has a computer must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Based on the clues provided:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).

From these clues, we can deduce that:
- The person who ate fried rice lives in house 2.
- The person who ate pizza lives in house 1.
- Since the person who ate pizza is the one who likes science fiction books, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From these clues:
- The pianist lives in house 1.
- The root beer lover lives in house 2.
- The person who owns horses lives in house 1 (since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who owns horses, and the root beer lover is in house 2).

Since the person who owns horses is in house 1, the person who owns horses is the dog owner. Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

3. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fried rice eater and fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2.

4. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

5. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

Now, let's place the known elements:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater

Since the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively, and the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, the only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."

8. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 7, we know that the person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes white lives in the first house and the person who has daffodils lives in the second house, the person who owns horses must live in the third house.

Thus, the person who owns horses lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).

10. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
11. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. This means the person who likes green lives in the first house.

From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. This means the person who likes yellow lives in house 3.

From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who likes green lives in house 1, the person who has a radio must live in house 2. Therefore, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

From clue 6, the person who has a phone does not live in the second house. Since the person who has a phone lives in house 1, this is consistent.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a phone lives in house 1, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 2 or 3. But since the person who likes blue lives in house 3, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 2.

From clue 8, the tennis player lives in the third house. This means the person who likes blue lives in house 3.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing sandals must live in house 4, the cricketer must live in house 3.

However, we have a contradiction because the person who likes blue lives in house 3, and the person who has a gameboy also lives in house 3. This means we need to recheck the placement of the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy.

Since the person who likes blue lives in house 3, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 4. This means the cricketer must live in house 2.

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in House 1.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and since the romance book lover is to the left of the history book buff, the only possible arrangement for these two is:
- Romance book lover in House 2
- History book buff in House 3

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in House 1, so they must live in either House 2 or House 3. Since the romance book lover is in House 2, the person who had pizza must be in House 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes green must be to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in House 3, the person who likes green must be in House 2. This is consistent with the arrangement we have.

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in House 1.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

Let's start by placing the tennis player and the television based on Clue 1. The tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be to the left of the television. So, the possible pairs are:
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 3
- Tennis player in house 2, television in house 3

### Case 1: Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Television (V) in house 2

Now, the golfer cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3. But since the tennis player is already in house 1, the golfer must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Golfer (G) in house 3

This leaves house 2 for the computer and house 3 for the radio and rose bouquet. Since the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses (Clue 3), and the radio and rose bouquet must be in adjacent houses (Clue 4 and Clue 5), we need to place the computer and tulips in house 2 and the radio and rose bouquet in house 3.

### Checking the placement:
- House 1: Tennis player (T)
- House 2: Computer (C) and Tulips (Tul)
- House 3: Radio (R) and Rose bouquet (Rb)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. Tennis player (T) is to the left of the television (V) in house 1 and house 2.
2. Golfer (G) is in house 3.
3. Computer (C) and tulips (Tul) are in adjacent houses (house 2).
4. Radio (R) and rose bouquet (Rb) are in adjacent houses (house 3).
5. Radio (R) is to the right of the television (V) in house 3.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this problem, we need to match each person with their characteristics based on the given clues. Let's break down the clues and use them to deduce the correct house number for the person wearing sandals.

### Clues Recap:
1. The swimmer lives in the third house.
2. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
5. The violinist lives in the second house.
6. The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
7. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
8. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
9. The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
10. The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
11. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
12. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.

### Deductions:
- **Clue 1:** The swimmer lives in the third house.
  - House 3: Swimmer

- **Clue 2:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
  - This means the guitarist cannot live in house 5, and the carnations arrangement cannot live in house 1.

- **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
  - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the tulips person is in house X+1.

- **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
  - This means if the running shoes person is in house X, the daffodils person is in house X+1.

- **Clue 5:** The violinist lives in the second house.
  - House 2: Violinist

- **Clue 6:** The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
  - This means if the basketball player is in house X, the guitarist is in house X+1.

- **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
  - This means if the high heels person is in house X, the lilies person is in house X+1.

- **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
  - This means if the loafers person is in house X, the percussionist is in house X+1.

- **Clue 9:** The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
  - House 4: Cricketer

- **Clue 10:** The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
  - This means they must be in houses X and X+1.

- **Clue 11:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
  - House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

- **Clue 12:** There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.
  - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the cellist must be in house X+3 or X-3 (but since houses are numbered 1 to 5, X-3 is not possible).

### Deduction Process:
1. **House 1:** Not possible for violinist, cricketer, or cellist.
2. **House 2:** Violinist.
3. **House 3:** Swimmer.
4. **House 4:** Cricketer.
5. **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils.

Given Clue 11, the daffodils person is in house 5. Clue 12 tells us that the sandals person must be in house 1.

### Final Check:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

The person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"Based on the clues provided:

1. The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:
- The fish enthusiast lives in house 1 (since they are directly left of the person wearing high heels, who lives in house 2).
- The person in house 2 ate grilled cheese.
- The person in house 1 is the fish enthusiast, and since they are not the dog owner, they must be the person who had stew.

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

1. **Romance book lover (5th house)**
2. **Fish enthusiast (3rd house)**

11. The person eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
12. The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
13. The science fiction book fanatic and the person wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From Clue 2, the person with a phone lives in the third house. From Clue 4, the flutist lives in the third house. From Clue 6, the person wearing running shoes also lives in the third house. This means Clue 2 and Clue 6 are consistent since the phone and running shoes can be different people.

From Clue 5, the person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots. From Clue 3, the saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots. This means the person wearing boots must be in house 2, the saxophonist in house 1, and the person eating oranges in house 4.

From Clue 7, the romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic. This means SF and RL must be in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 11, the person eating kiwis does not live in the first house. So, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, which is consistent with the saxophonist being in house 1.

From Clue 12, there are two houses between where the person wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives. This means the person wearing high heels must be in house 1, and the fantasy book enthusiast in house 3.

From Clue 13, the percussionist lives in the fourth house, which is consistent with the person eating oranges being in house 4.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic and the person wearing running shoes live directly next to each other. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house.

Therefore, the person eating oranges lives in house 4.

"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

From Clue 7, the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the saxophonist.

From Clue 6, the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 1, the romance book lover (in the second house) lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the guitarist must be in the third house, and the history book buff must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is occupied by the romance book lover. This means the history book buff must be in the first house.

Thus, the final positions are:
- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Romance book lover
- **House 3:** Saxophonist
- **House 4:** Mystery book reader
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to deduce the characteristics and positions of the people in the houses based on the given clues:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

Let's break it down step by step:

- **Clue 1:** The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
  - House 4: Television

- **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
  - House 2: Loafers

- **Clue 3:** The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
  - House 2: Loafers (already determined)
  - House 3: Phone (since the phone cannot be in house 2)

- **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
  - House 1: Boots
  - House 2: Loafers

- **Clue 5:** There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
  - House 1: Boots
  - House 2: Loafers
  - House 3: Phone
  - House 4: Television

Given the remaining houses (1, 2, 3, and 4) and the characteristics:
- Radio
- Gameboy
- Phone
- Sandals

We need to place the remaining characteristics in the remaining houses (houses 1, 2, 3, and 4).

From Clue 5, we know:
- The radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4.
- Since house 2 is already occupied by loafers, the radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3.

Let's consider the possible placements:
- If the radio is in house 1, then the sandals must be in house 3.
- If the radio is in house 3, then the sandals must be in house 1.

Let's test these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Radio in house 1, Sandals in house 3**
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 1: Radio
- House 3: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which contradicts Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

**Scenario 2: Radio in house 3, Sandals in house 1**
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television
- House 3: Radio
- House 1: Sandals

This leaves the gameboy for house 2, which is consistent with Clue 3 (the phone is in house 3).

Thus, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television

The person who has a gameboy lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house, so they must live in either the first or the third house.

4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house, so they must live in the third house.
5. The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the coffee drinker lives in the third house. From Clue 3, the person who likes milk cannot be in the first house, so they must be in the second house. This leaves the first house for the person who wears running shoes.

Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

We can deduce the following:

The answer is (E) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

Let's deduce the placements step by step:

- From Clue 4, the rose bouquet person can only be in house 1 or 3.
- From Clue 2, the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
- From Clue 3, the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:
  - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **First house**: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
2. **Fourth house**: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Third house**: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
4. **Second house**: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Given the constraints, the only possible positions for the swimmer and the cricketer are:
- Cricketer in the first house (yellow), and swimmer in the third house (blue).
- Cricketer in the third house (blue), and swimmer in the first house (yellow).

Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the cricketer must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house.

Now, the second house must be occupied by the person who likes white and the person who is eating oranges. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (yellow), and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the first house (yellow). Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.

This leaves the person who owns an SUV in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them as follows:

1. **Green and Yellow**: The person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives directly next to the person who likes green.
   - Therefore, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

2. **Stew and Grilled Cheese**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house.

3. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

4. **Grilled Cheese**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house and the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

5. **Romance Book Lover**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the romance book lover lives in the second house, which is consistent with the previous information.

### Summary of Arrangement

- **First House**: Person who ate grilled cheese
- **Second House**: Person who had stew, romance book lover
- **Third House**: Person who likes green, fantasy book enthusiast

### Determining the Person Who Likes Blue

- The person who likes green lives in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow lives in the second house.
- The person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

### Final Answer

"To determine the house where the bird keeper lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (number 1).
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. From clue 2, the cellist also lives in house 1. This creates a contradiction because only one person can live in each house. Therefore, we need to reassess the clues.

Given that the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist cannot both live in the first house, let's consider the possibility that the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1) and the cellist lives in the second house (number 2).

Now, using clue 3: the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the first house (number 1) is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast, the person who likes green must live in the second house (number 2), and the person who likes red must live in the first house (number 1).

This means:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green.
- The person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

Now, we need to determine the mystery book reader. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green and the person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"To determine the house where the swimmer lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

From Clue 3, the history book buff lives in the first house. This confirms our arrangement:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

Now, using Clue 1: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives. This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in the first or third house because there would be no house between them and the swimmer. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Now, the swimmer must live in the first or third house. But since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the swimmer must live in the first house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is **1**."
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the positions of the people in the houses:

1. **Bird Keeper in House 3**: From clue 8, the bird keeper lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Bird Keeper

2. **Soccer Player and Banana Eater**: From clue 7, the person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the soccer player.
   - House 2: Soccer Player
   - House 1: Banana Eater

3. **Fried Rice Eater**: From clue 4, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Fried Rice Eater

4. **History Book Buff and Spaghetti Eater**: From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
   - House 1: Banana Eater (already filled)
   - House 2: Soccer Player
   - House 3: Bird Keeper
   - House 4: Fried Rice Eater
   - House 1: Spaghetti Eater

5. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast and Soccer Player**: From clue 10, the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

   - House 4: Fried Rice Eater
   - House 1: Fantasy Book Enthusiast
   - House 2: Pizza Eater
   - House 3: History Book Buff
   - House 4: Baseball Player

### Conclusion:
The person who had stew lives in House 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"To determine the house where the person who ate fried rice lives, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
   - This means if Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals, then Person 2 (House 2) must own horses.
   - If Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals, then Person 1 (House 1) must own horses.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means if Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti, then Person 2 (House 2) must be the history book buff.
   - If Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti, then Person 1 (House 1) must be the history book buff.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

- **Scenario 1:** Person 1 (House 1) owns horses and is wearing sandals.
  - Person 2 (House 2) is the history book buff.
  - Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti.
  - Person 2 (House 2) is the cat lover.
  - Person 1 (House 1) is the romance book lover.
  - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing running shoes.

- **Scenario 2:** Person 2 (House 2) owns horses and is wearing sandals.
  - Person 1 (House 1) is the history book buff.
  - Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti.
  - Person 1 (House 1) is the cat lover.
  - Person 2 (House 2) is the romance book lover.
  - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing running shoes.

In both scenarios, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is **2**."
"Based on the clues provided:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The flutist does not live in the first house.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:
- The person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house 2 because the sedan owner lives to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies, and the flutist cannot be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is:

(B) 2"
"To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).
4. **Tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the tennis player is in house \(i+1\) or later.
5. **There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet**: This means if the rose bouquet is in house \(i\), the daffodils are in house \(i+1\) or \(i-1\).
6. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\).

### Deductions:
- **House 3**: Rose bouquet.
- **House 2**: Fantasy book enthusiast (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer).
- **House 4**: Tennis player (since the tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader, and house 4 is taken by the carnations arrangement, the tennis player must be in house 5, but house 5 is not available, so the tennis player must be in house 4, which is a contradiction, so the tennis player must be in house 5).
- **House 1**: Mystery book reader (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- **House 5**: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

### Final Placement:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player.
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast.

### Conclusion:
The romance book lover must be in house 2, as there are two houses between the mystery book reader (house 1) and the romance book lover.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Coffee drinker lives in the third house (House 3).**
2. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the computer and gameboy cannot be in House 3. So, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
3. **The saxophonist does not live in the second house.**
4. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.**
5. **The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.**
6. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - If the computer is in House 5, the gameboy must be in House 4 (but the coffee drinker is in House 3). So, the computer must be in House 5 and the gameboy in House 4.
7. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.**
   - Computer in House 5, so cellist must be in House 4.
8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the computer is in House 5, the percussionist must be in House 4 (but cellist is in House 4). So, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3 and the percussionist in House 5.
9. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
10. **The person who likes milk lives in the fifth house.**
    - House 5: Milk drinker.
11. **The person who has a television does not live in the fifth house.**
    - Possible houses for television: 1, 2, 3, 4.
12. **The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).
13. **The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).
14. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
15. **The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).
16. **The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

From the above deductions, we can conclude:
- Coffee drinker in House 3.
- Computer in House 5, cellist in House 4, percussionist in House 5.
- Milk drinker in House 5.
- Television in House 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Saxophonist in House 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Water drinker in House 1, 2, 3, 4.

"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The golfer lives in house 1.
2. The person who drives a minivan lives in house 3.
3. The person who had pizza lives in house 3 (since they must be to the right of the person with the rose bouquet).
4. The person wearing running shoes does not live in house 1, so they must live in house 2.
5. The person wearing boots lives in house 2 (since they must be directly left of the person who drives a minivan).
6. The person with the rose bouquet must live in house 1 (since they cannot be in house 2 or 3, and the person with pizza is in house 3).

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. The saxophonist lives in house 3.
2. The flutist lives in house 2.
3. The cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in house 3, the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Given the flutist is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti in house 2.
4. The person who had pizza and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 1 and the person who ate fried rice in house 3.
5. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist (house 3). Since the saxophonist is in house 3, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1 or 2. Given the cellist is in house 1, the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.
6. The person who likes root beer and the person who likes root beer live next to each other. Since the person who likes root beer is in house 2, the person who likes root beer must be in house 1.
7. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Given the person who likes root beer is in house 1, the person who likes milk must be in house 5 and the person who ate grilled cheese in house 4.
8. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red. Given the person who likes red is in house 4, the coffee drinker must be in house 5.
9. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. Given the saxophonist is in house 3, the person who likes yellow must be in house 1.
10. The person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live next to each other. Given the person who had pizza is in house 1, the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who had pizza is in house 1, the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water must be in houses 2 and 3. Given the person who had pizza is in house 1, the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who had pizza is in house 1, the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water must be in houses 2 and 3. Given the person who had pizza is in house 1, the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water must be in houses 2 and 3. Given the person who had pizza is in house 1, the person who had stew and the person who only drinks water must be in houses 2 and 3.

Thus, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is **4**.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"The correct answer is (A) 2.

To elaborate on the reasoning:

1. **Clue 7** states that the person who ate fried rice lives in house 3.
2. **Clue 8** indicates that the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.
3. **Clue 2** tells us that the person who had stew does not live in the second or fourth house.
4. **Clue 3** states that the person who had stew does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in house 1 or 2.
5. **Clue 1** indicates that the person who likes green does not live in the second house.
6. **Clue 6** specifies that the person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
7. **Clue 5** states that the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
8. **Clue 4** indicates that the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:
- Since fried rice is in house 3, the person who had stew cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes green cannot be in house 2 (Clue 1).
- The person who likes red must be in house 4 (Clue 6), and the person who had stew must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- This leaves house 2 for the person who likes white and house 4 for the person who likes yellow.

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in house 2."
"To determine the house where the basketball player lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives in the second house.
   - This means the percussionist lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 1**: The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the basketball player cannot be in house 3.

3. **Clue 2**: The person who likes red lives in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house number 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2.

5. **Clue 3**: The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
   - This means the basketball player cannot be in house 1, and the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

Given these clues, let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Not occupied (since the percussionist is in house 2)
- House 2: Occupied by the percussionist
- House 3: Occupied by the person who likes red
- House 4: Not occupied (since the person who likes red is in house 3)

We need to place the remaining people (the violinist, the tennis player, and the basketball player) in houses 1, 2, and 4.

From Clue 1, the violinist must be in a house to the right of the basketball player. This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the basketball player cannot be in house 3.

From Clue 3, the basketball player must be to the right of the tennis player. This means the tennis player cannot be in house 3.

From Clue 4, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2.

Let's place the violinist and the basketball player:
- Since the violinist must be to the right of the basketball player, and the percussionist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 4.
- This leaves house 1 for the tennis player and house 3 for the person who likes red.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: Person who likes red
- House 4: Violinist

Therefore, the basketball player must be in house 1.

The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (A) 1."
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house number 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"Based on the given clues and logical deductions, the person who drives a minivan lives in house number 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the given clues, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 4"
"To determine the house where the dog owner lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The basketball player lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist lives in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

Given that the basketball player lives in the first house (Clue 5), and the saxophonist also lives in the first house (Clue 6), we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: ?
- House 3: ?

From Clue 4, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the pizza eater and the dog owner are adjacent.

From Clue 2, the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer. This means the tea drinker and the cricketer are adjacent.

From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the person who only drinks water and the fish enthusiast are adjacent.

From Clue 1, there is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives. This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not adjacent.

From Clue 7, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk. This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are not adjacent.

Let's place the remaining people:
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Guitarist (since the cat lover and guitarist are not adjacent and the cat lover cannot be in house 1)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (tea drinker, pizza eater)

This configuration works:
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Guitarist
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (tea drinker, pizza eater)

Since the pizza eater and the dog owner are adjacent (Clue 4), the dog owner must be in house 3.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The history book buff lives in house 1.
2. The cat lover does not live in house 2, so the cat lover must live in house 1.
3. The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils.
4. The person with a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person with loafers.
5. The person with loafers must be in house 1 (since the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2).

From clue 5, the person with loafers is in house 1, and the person with a computer is in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the person with high heels and house 2 for the person with a bouquet of daffodils.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is **1**.

**Answer: (B) 1**"

12. **Pizza to the right of saxophonist.**
13. **Piano not in House 3.**
14. **Piano not in House 4.**
15. **Tulips in House 1.**

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Carnations

From Clue 10, we know:
- The banana must be in House 3 or 4.
- The pizza must be in House 4 or 5.

From Clue 11, we know:
- The piano cannot be in House 4.

From Clue 12, we know:
- The saxophonist must be in House 3 or 4.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The history book buff lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. **Clue 12**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
4. **Clue 11**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 13**: The guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
6. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. **Clue 9**: The flutist does not live in the first house.
10. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
11. **Clue 5**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
12. **Clue 4**: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the history book buff in the second house:
1. Second house: History book buff

Next, we need to place the fantasy book enthusiast in the fourth house:
1. Second house: History book buff
4. Fourth house: Fantasy book enthusiast

Now, let's place the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who ate fried rice. Since there is one house between the history book buff and the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice, we can place the person who has a bouquet of daffodils in the first house and the person who ate fried rice in the third house:
1. First house: Person with bouquet of daffodils
3. Third house: Person who ate fried rice

Next, we need to place the person who had pizza and the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who had pizza must be in the first house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house:
1. First house: Person who had pizza
3. Third house: Person who ate spaghetti

Now, we need to place the percussionist and the guitarists. Since the percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house, the percussionist must be in the second house:
2. Second house: Percussionist

Finally, we need to place the guitarist and the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist is directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the fourth house, the guitarist must be in the third house:
3. Third house: Guitarist
4. Fourth house: Person with vase of tulips

Now, we need to place the person who likes blue, the person who likes yellow, the person who likes white, and the person who likes green. Since the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist, and the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, the person who likes blue must be in the first house:
1. First house: Person who likes blue

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who likes white.
- The person who likes green lives two houses to the right of the person who likes blue.

Thus, the arrangement is:
1. First house: Person who likes blue
2. Second house: Percussionist
3. Third house: Guitarist
4. Fourth house: Person who likes yellow

Therefore, the person who lives in the fourth house is the one who likes yellow. The cellist must live in the second house.

The number of the house where the cellist lives is **2**.

**Answer: (B) 2**"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
2. The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
4. There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

- **Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

- **Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
  - If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
  - If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

- **Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
  - If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.
  - If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

- **Clue 2:** The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
  - If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
  - If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).
- There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (Clue 4).

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating kiwis lives in house 1.

From clue 1, we know that the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in house 1. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
6. The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
8. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
9. The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
10. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
11. The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

From Clue 7, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese.

From Clue 11, there is one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who has a television. This means the person who ate fried rice and the person who has a television must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who has a television must be in the third house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 8, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This confirms that the third house is occupied by the person who likes red.

"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

We can deduce the following:

- Since the root beer lover cannot be in the second house, they must be in the first house.
- The pianist and the cellist must be in adjacent houses, with the pianist in the house to the left of the cellist.

Therefore, if the root beer lover is in house 1, the pianist must be in house 1 and the cellist must be in house 2.

Thus, the root beer lover lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing boots and the person who has a carnations arrangement live directly next to each other.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
3. The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.

6. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fourth house.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fifth house.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From clue 7, we know the fifth house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From clue 6, the person with tulips does not live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person with tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person with daffodils.

From clue 4, there is one house between the person with running shoes and the person with lilies.

From clue 2, the person with tulips lives directly left of the person with loafers.

From clue 1, the person with boots and the person with carnations live directly next to each other.

From clue 3, the person with sandals does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person with daffodils and the person with running shoes live directly next to each other.

Let's place the people based on these clues:
- The fifth house is occupied by the person with carnations.
- The fourth house is not occupied by tulips.
- The third house is not daffodils (since daffodils and running shoes are adjacent).
- The second house is not tulips (since tulips are to the right of daffodils).
- The first house is not sandals (since sandals are not in the fifth house).

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- The person with sandals must be in the first house.
- The person with boots is in the fourth house (since the fifth house is occupied by carnations and the fourth house is not occupied by sandals).
- The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with tulips is in the third house (since it is to the right of the person with daffodils and adjacent to the person with loafers).
- The person with daffodils is in the second house (since it is adjacent to the person with running shoes and the person with tulips is in the third house).
- The person with running shoes is in the second house (since it is adjacent to the person with daffodils and one house away from the person with lilies).
- The person with lilies is in the fourth house (since it is one house away from the person with running shoes).

Thus, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (D) 4."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The baseball player lives in house 2.
2. The swimmer and the person who likes white live next to each other, so they must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
3. The saxophonist lives to the left of the tennis player.
4. The percussionist lives to the left of the person who likes green.
5. The person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person who likes white.
6. There is one house between the person who likes blue and the person who eats oranges.
7. There is one house between the person who likes white and the tea drinker.
8. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
9. The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
10. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.

Let's analyze the positions:

- Since the baseball player is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 or 3.
- If the person who likes white is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 4 (since they are to the right of the person who likes white).
- If the person who likes white is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 4.
- The saxophonist must be in house 1 or 3, and the tennis player must be in house 2 or 4.
- The percussionist must be in house 1 or 3, and the green person must be in house 2 or 4.
- The person who likes blue must be in house 1 or 3, and the person who eats oranges must be in house 2 or 4.
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 or 3, and the person who eats grapes must be in house 2 or 4.
- The person who likes blue must be to the left of the tea drinker, and the tea drinker must be in house 4.

Given all these constraints, the only consistent arrangement is:
- House 1: Blue
- House 2: Tennis player
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Green, Pianist, Coffee drinker, or Percussionist

Since the saxophonist is to the left of the tennis player, and the percussionist is to the left of the green person, the only possible positions are:
- Green in house 1, Pianist in house 2, Coffee drinker in house 3, Percussionist in house 4.

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"To determine the house where the person who ate fried rice lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the first house is occupied by someone who likes white. From Clue 4, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or third house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house (since the person who had stew cannot live in the second house).

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who likes white must live in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew.

Now, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. The person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the second house (Clue 3), so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. Since the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or second house. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people. From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The coffee drinker (CD) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW).
2. The science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in the first house (house 1).

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The SF lives in house 1.
- The CD cannot be in house 1, so the CD must be in house 2.
- The SW cannot be in house 1, so the SW must be in house 1.
- This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to the remaining houses.

Since the CD (coffee drinker) is in house 2, the water drinker must be in house 1. This leaves the romance book lover to be in house 2.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

- The percussionist lives in House 1.
- The person with the radio lives in House 2.
- The pianist lives in House 2 (since the percussionist is in House 1 and they must be neighbors).
- The person with the phone lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:

(A) 1"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know the second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 2, the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them. This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3.

From clue 3, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Given the positions of the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan, the only way this can be satisfied is if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3 and the person who likes yellow is in house 2.

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Bird Keeper
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Fish Enthusiast
- House 4: Sandals
- House 5: Truck

Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover, and the person who is wearing high heels lives two houses to the right of the person who has a bouquet of lilies, we can place the person who has a bouquet of lilies in House 1 and the person who is wearing high heels in House 3.

- House 1: Bird Keeper
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Fish Enthusiast (Bouquet of Lilies)
- House 4: Sandals
- House 5: Truck

Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots, and the person who is wearing boots lives in House 4, the person who has a vase of tulips must live in House 3.

- House 1: Bird Keeper
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Fish Enthusiast (Bouquet of Lilies)
- House 4: Sandals (Vase of Tulips)
- House 5: Truck

Since the person who is eating grapes and the fish enthusiast live directly next to each other, and the fish enthusiast lives in House 3, the person who is eating grapes must live in House 4.

- House 1: Bird Keeper
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Fish Enthusiast (Bouquet of Lilies)
- House 4: Sandals (Vase of Tulips, Eating Grapes)
- House 5: Truck

Since the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who owns an SUV lives in House 5, the person who owns a sedan must live in House 4.

- House 1: Bird Keeper
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Fish Enthusiast (Bouquet of Lilies)
- House 4: Sandals (Vase of Tulips, Eating Grapes, Sedan)
- House 5: Truck (SUV)

Since the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house, and the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a truck, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in House 2, and the person who drives a truck must live in House 5.

- House 1: Bird Keeper
- House 2: Loafers (Running Shoes)
- House 3: Fish Enthusiast (Bouquet of Lilies)
- House 4: Sandals (Vase of Tulips, Eating Grapes, Sedan)
- House 5: Truck (SUV, Driving a Truck)

Since the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the fish enthusiast, and the fish enthusiast lives in House 3, the person who is eating apples must live in House 2.

- House 1: Bird Keeper
- House 2: Loafers (Running Shoes, Eating Apples)
- House 3: Fish Enthusiast (Bouquet of Lilies)
- House 4: Sandals (Vase of Tulips, Eating Grapes, Sedan)
- House 5: Truck (SUV, Driving a Truck)

Since the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a truck, the person who drives a truck must live in House 5.

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in House 5.

The correct answer is (C) 5."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Fried Rice Eater, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: Grilled Cheese Eater

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

- Clue 1 states that the person with the carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.
- Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the dog owner must be in house 2 (as they are to the right of the carnations arrangement holder), the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the individuals step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.
   - If the person drinking water is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means if the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person liking yellow must be in house 2.
   - If the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person liking yellow must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is **2**.

**Correct option:** (B) 2"
"Based on the clues provided:

1. The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with a television.

From these clues:
- The person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since they live next to the person eating grapes and the tea drinker must be in house 1).
- The person eating grapes must also be in house 1.
- The tea drinker must be in house 1.
- The person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (since they live to the right of the person wearing sandals and cannot be in house 1).

This leaves the person in house 2 with a phone, drinking water, and eating kiwis.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating kiwis lives is (A) 2."
"To solve this, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
2. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
4. The violinist does not live in the third house.

Given the tea drinker is in house 1, we can deduce the following:

- The cellist cannot be in house 3 (from Clue 1).
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (from Clue 4).
- The guitarist cannot be in house 3 (since the violinist cannot be there and there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

So, the possible positions for the cellist and the guitarist are:
- Cellist in house 2 (since the cellist cannot be in house 3).
- Guitarist in house 3 (since the cellist is in house 2 and there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

Let's verify this:
- The tea drinker is in house 1.
- The cellist is in house 2.
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), so the violinist must be in house 2 (but that's already taken by the cellist), so the violinist must be in house 3.
- The guitarist must be in house 3.

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the third house is occupied by someone wearing sandals. From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing sandals is in the third house.

From Clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 2, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. This means the first house is occupied by someone other than the person wearing running shoes.

From Clue 5, there is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives. This means the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5. Since the third house is occupied by someone wearing sandals, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water (in the fourth house) must be to the left of the person who is wearing boots (in the first house).

Given all these constraints, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who is wearing boots
- Second house: Person who is wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person who likes milk (and wearing sandals)
- Fourth house: Person who only drinks water
- Fifth house: Person who drinks tea

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct placement of the devices and meals:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza

2. **Clue 8:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.
   - Computer cannot be in house 4.

3. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
   - Computer and gameboy must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - TV and phone must be in houses with TV to the left of phone.

5. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
   - Grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house.

6. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
   - Gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house.

7. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in adjacent houses.

8. **Clue 6:** The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
   - Radio cannot be in house 4.

Let's place the computer and gameboy in adjacent houses, and consider the possible placements:

- If Computer is in house 1, Gameboy must be in house 2.
- If Computer is in house 2, Gameboy must be in house 3.
- If Computer is in house 3, Gameboy must be in house 4 (but house 4 is occupied by pizza).
- If Computer is in house 4, Gameboy must be in house 5.
- If Computer is in house 5, Gameboy must be in house 4 (but house 4 is occupied by pizza).

So, the only valid placements are:
- Computer in house 1, Gameboy in house 2.
- Computer in house 2, Gameboy in house 3.
- Computer in house 3, Gameboy in house 4 (but house 4 is occupied by pizza).

Thus, Computer in house 1, Gameboy in house 2.

Now, let's place the radio and grilled cheese:
- Grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house.
- Radio cannot be in house 4.

Let's try:
- Grilled cheese in house 3, radio in house 4 (but house 4 is occupied by pizza).
- Grilled cheese in house 4, radio in house 5.

So, Grilled cheese in house 3, radio in house 5.

Now, let's place the fried rice and spaghetti:
- Fried rice and spaghetti must be in adjacent houses.
- Grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in adjacent houses.

Let's try:
- Grilled cheese in house 3, spaghetti in house 4 (but house 4 is occupied by pizza).
- Grilled cheese in house 4, spaghetti in house 5.

So, Grilled cheese in house 3, spaghetti in house 5.

Finally, let's place the television and phone:
- Television must be to the left of the phone.
- Computer in house 1, Gameboy in house 2, Grilled cheese in house 3, Radio in house 5, Spaghetti in house 4, Pizza in house 4 (but house 4 is occupied by pizza).

So, the correct placement is:
- Computer in house 1.
- Gameboy in house 2.
- Grilled cheese in house 3.
- Radio in house 5.
- Spaghetti in house 4.
- Pizza in house 4 (but house 4 is occupied by pizza).

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 4.

18. **Apples and Golfer**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
19. **Pizza and Fifth House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 15, the tennis player lives in the first house. From clue 16, the percussionist lives in the fourth house. From clue 17, the pianist does not live in the third house. From clue 18, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. From clue 19, the person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

Given that the pianist does not live in the third house, and considering the constraints, the pianist must live in the second house. This leaves the first house for the tennis player, the second house for the bird keeper, the third house for the saxophonist, the fourth house for the percussionist, and the fifth house for the person who is eating a banana.

From clue 9, the person who is eating a banana lives directly next to the person who had stew. Given the constraints, the only logical placement for the person who is eating a banana is in the fifth house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is **5**.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives to the right of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house, so the percussionist must be in house 1.

From this, we know:
- The percussionist lives in house 1.
- The grilled cheese eater lives in house 2.
- The bird keeper lives in house 1 (but since the grilled cheese eater is already in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2).

This leaves the guitarist and the pizza eater to be placed in the remaining houses (houses 1 and 2). Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2, the guitarist and the pizza eater must be in the remaining houses.

Since the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2 (because the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the pizza eater cannot be in house 2).

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

- The sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player.
- The soccer player must be to the left of the bird keeper (house number 3).
- The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the soccer player.

- House 1: Convertible driver
- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Sedan owner

This leaves house number 1 for the cat lover and house number 2 for the fish enthusiast, which satisfies the conditions that the cat lover does not live in house number 2 and the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the soccer player.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

2. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana must be in houses 1 and 3, or houses 2 and 4. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

3. **Clue 4**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes green must be in a house to the left of the person who likes yellow. Given the arrangement so far, the person who likes green must be in house 1 or house 2. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who likes white, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This contradicts Clue 6, which states that the person who is eating grapes is in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: Yellow

4. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who likes red lives in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:

   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, this clue is satisfied. So, the arrangement so far is:

   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3 and the person who is eating kiwis must be in a house to the right of house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4. So, the arrangement is:
   - House 1: Green

2. The person eating stew and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in adjacent houses.
3. The person eating stew and the person who is a cat lover must be in adjacent houses.

Given that the person eating stew must be in house 1 (since the person eating stew and the person wearing running shoes are adjacent, and the person eating stew and the person who is a cat lover are adjacent), and the person eating stew is next to the person who is wearing running shoes, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

This leaves house 3 for the person who is a cat lover and the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who is a cat lover and the person who is a mystery book reader must be adjacent, and the person who is a mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be adjacent, the only way to fit all these clues is:

- House 1: Person eating stew
- House 2: Person wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is a cat lover and person who ate fried rice

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

From Clue 5, if the person with the television lives in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 (which contradicts Clue 2). Therefore, the person with the television must live in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - Boots: House 1, 2

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - Kiwis: House 1, 2
   - Milk: House 2, 3

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Boots: House 1, 2
   - Gameboy: House 1, 2, 3

7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - Kiwis: House 2, 3

### Deductions

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers (Clue 1)
- **House 2:** Phone, Boots, Gameboy (Clue 2, Clue 6)
- **House 3:** Mangos, Milk, Kiwis (Clue 2, Clue 5)

From Clue 2, the phone and mangos must be in different houses, and the phone must be to the left of the mangos. Since the phone is in House 2, the mangos must be in House 3.

From Clue 3, grapes and water must be in adjacent houses. Since the phone is in House 2, grapes must be in House 1 and water must be in House 3.

From Clue 5, kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses. Since the mangos are in House 3, kiwis must be in House 2 and milk must be in House 3.

From Clue 6, boots must be to the right of the gameboy. Since the phone is in House 2, the gameboy must be in House 1 and the boots must be in House 2.

Since the person with the phone is in House 2, the person with the phone is not the one who has a computer. The person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy, so the person with the phone is the one who has a computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

"To determine the house where the person who drives a truck lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating oranges.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the truck and convertible drivers must be in adjacent houses, and the truck driver must be to the left of the convertible driver.

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the bird keeper and dog owner must be in houses with the bird keeper to the right of the dog owner.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not eating mangos.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Owning horses.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 5, we know:
- House 3: Owning horses.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Eating oranges.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 3: Not eating mangos.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in adjacent houses.

Since the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), and the person driving a convertible must be adjacent to the person eating mangos (Clue 6), the only possible positions for the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible are:
- House 1: Eating oranges (Clue 1)
- House 2: Driving a convertible (Clue 6)
- House 3: Owning horses (Clue 5)

Now, we need to place the bird keeper and the dog owner. From Clue 3, the bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are 2 and 3, but house 3 is occupied by the person owning horses. Therefore, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 1. Given that house 1 is occupied by the person eating oranges, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 3.

Thus, the only remaining house for the person driving a truck is house 2.

### Conclusion

The person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."

### Deductions:
1. **Clue 1 and Clue 2**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader must be somewhere to the left of the percussionist, and the percussionist must be somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This implies the mystery book reader and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

2. **Clue 3**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the percussionist.

3. **Clue 4**: There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. This means the saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, and the person who had pizza must be in the second or fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader.

5. **Clue 6**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. This means the flutist must be in a house to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

6. **Clue 7**: The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the guitarist and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist.

7. **Clue 8**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese eater must be in adjacent houses, and the grilled cheese eater must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

8. **Clue 9**: There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the history book buff must be in the house directly to the right or left of the mystery book reader.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the first, second, fourth, or fifth houses.

### Analyzing the Clues:
Let's start by placing the mystery book reader and the saxophonist:
- The saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, so he must be in the second or fourth house.
- The mystery book reader must be directly left of the saxophonist, so the saxophonist must be in the second house and the mystery book reader must be in the first house.

Now, let's place the percussionist:
- The percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the percussionist must be in the third or fourth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist, so the guitarist must be in the first or second house.

Given the saxophonist is in the second house, the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the guitarist is to the left of the percussionist, the only possible positions for the percussionist are the third or fourth house. Let's check the third house:
- If the percussionist is in the third house, the guitarist must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the percussionist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the science fiction book fanatic:
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house because the mystery book reader is there.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the second house.

Now, let's place the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist:
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or second house, but the first house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.
- Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Now, let's place the history book buff:
- The history book buff must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the history book buff must be in the third house, and the flutist must be in the fourth house.

Finally, let's place the person who ate spaghetti:
- The person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 4."
"Based on the given clues and the logical deductions made, the person who is eating mangos lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 5"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. **House 3**: Green
2. **House 3**: Radio
3. **House 3**: Computer (since the computer must be to the left of the phone, and the computer cannot be in house 2)
4. **House 3**: Phone
5. **House 3**: Gameboy
6. **House 3**: Television (since the television lives directly left of the person who likes red, and the television is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2)
7. **House 2**: Red
8. **House 2**: Percussionist (since the percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white, and the percussionist is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 3)
9. **House 3**: White
10. **House 1**: Saxophonist (since the saxophonist must be in the remaining house, which is house 1)
11. **House 1**: Guitarist (since the guitarist lives directly next to the percussionist, and the percussionist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1)
12. **House 4**: Cellist (since the cellist does not live in house 5, and the cellist cannot be in house 1, the cellist must be in house 4)
13. **House 4**: Television (since the television lives directly left of the person who likes red, and the television is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2)
14. **House 5**: Violinist (since the violinist lives two houses away from the percussionist, and the percussionist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 5)

Therefore, the saxophonist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist must be in house 1 and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - Given the positions of the cellist and the mystery book reader, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

Let's break it down step by step:

- **Clue 1** implies that if the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this scenario is not possible.
- **Clue 2** states that the dog owner does not live in the second house. Therefore, the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 3** indicates that the person with the vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the dog owner is in house 1:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1), so the bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 1.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 (Clue 3).

- If the dog owner is in house 3:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1), so the bird keeper must be in house 1 or house 2.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 3.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 (Clue 3).

From the above analysis, the only consistent scenario is when the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them as follows:

1. **House 4: Swimmer**
2. **House 3: Banana**
3. **House 2: Computer**

"To solve this, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating mangos.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not horses.

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, and vice versa.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not banana.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not horses.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the person eating a banana is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 2. This leaves house 3 and house 4 for the remaining characteristics.

From Clue 1, house 1 is eating mangos, and from Clue 2, house 1 is not owning horses. Therefore, house 1 is not the bird keeper or the person eating kiwis.

Since house 1 is not the bird keeper or the person eating kiwis, and house 2 is the dog owner, house 3 and house 4 must be the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis. Given Clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be adjacent. Since house 2 is the dog owner, house 3 must be the bird keeper and house 4 must be the person eating kiwis.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the only possible adjacent houses are the second and third houses.

From Clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in the third house, and the history book buff must live in the second house.

This leaves the romance book lover to live in the first house, but we know from Clue 1 that the first house is already occupied by the mystery book reader. Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the third house.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
   - This directly places the coffee drinker in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, with the apple eater to the left of the water drinker.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 2, 3, or 4.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 1 or 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the apple eater must be in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.
   - This means the kiwi eater lives in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives in house 2.
- From Clue 4, the mangos eater cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 4.
- From Clue 6, the kiwi eater cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1, 2, or 4.
- From Clue 2, the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, and the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker.
- From Clue 5, the apple eater must be to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's place the people based on these constraints:

- If the mangos eater is in house 1, then the kiwi eater must be in house 4 (since they cannot be in house 3).
- The apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Mangos eater
  - House 2: Coffee drinker (Clue 1)
  - House 3: Apple eater
  - House 4: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The mangos eater is in house 1.
- The kiwi eater is in house 4.
- The water drinker is in house 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"The person who is eating a banana lives in house number 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- **First House:** History Book Buff (Rose Bouquet)
- **Second House:** Soccer Player (Mystery Book Reader)
- **Third House:** Stew (Spaghetti, Running Shoes)
- **Fourth House:** Daffodils (Golfer)

Therefore, the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.

The correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"To determine the house where the percussionist lives, let's analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. **Clue 6:** The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

From Clue 6, the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. Let's consider the possible positions for the flutist:

- If the flutist is in house 1, then the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2.
- If the flutist is in house 2, then the person who drives a minivan must be in house 3.

#### Case 1: Flutist in house 1, Minivan in house 2
- Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck must be in house 3.
- Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. So, the gameboy must be in house 3.
- Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. So, the cellist must be in house 2.
- Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 2, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 3. Since the gameboy is in house 3, the person with the television must be in house 1 and the person with high heels must be in house 3.
- Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 3 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

So, in this case, the percussionist lives in house 1.

#### Case 2: Flutist in house 2, Minivan in house 3
- Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck must be in house 1.
- Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. So, the gameboy must be in house 1.
- Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. So, the cellist must be in house 3.
- Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the gameboy is in house 1, the person with the television must be in house 2 and the person with high heels must be in house 1.
- Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

This case contradicts Clue 5, as the minivan cannot be in house 3 if the truck is in house 1. Therefore, this case is invalid.

### Conclusion
The only valid configuration is the one where the flutist is in house 1, the minivan is in house 2, the cellist is in house 2, the gameboy is in house 3, the person with high heels is in house 3, the person with the television is in house 1, the person with boots is in house 3, and the percussionist is in house 1.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their belongings:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house (house 5).
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (house 2).
3. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist, so the pianist must be in house 3.
4. **Clue 13**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils (house 2) lives directly left of the person who has a television (house 3).
5. **Clue 8**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
6. **Clue 7**: The person who has a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
8. **Clue 3**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
9. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
10. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 12**: The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.
12. **Clue 1**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pianist
- House 5: Grapes

Since the person who is eating grapes lives in house 5, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since they live directly left of the saxophonist, and the saxophonist must be in house 3).

Now, we need to place the remaining people:
- House 1: Violinist (since the violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other, and the violinist must be in house 1).
- House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pianist
- House 5: Grapes

The remaining person (the person who is eating mangos) must be in house 1 (since they live somewhere to the right of the violinist, and the violinist is in house 1).

So, the person who is eating apples must be in house 3, which is the house with the television.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person with the lilies bouquet lives in the second house.
2. The person with the SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
3. The person with the truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
4. The person with the truck lives somewhere to the right of the person with the minivan.
5. The person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.
- The truck driver is to the right of the root beer lover.
- The minivan driver is not in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
2. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
4. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who had stew.
5. The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 4, we know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. Since the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 1), and the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck (Clue 3), we can infer the following:

- House 1: Person who likes blue (rose bouquet)
- House 2: Person who has a rose bouquet (blue)
- House 3: Person who likes red (truck)

Given Clue 5, the person who likes red does not live in the first house, which aligns with our deduction.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person who had stew lives in House 1 (Clue 4), the person who drives a minivan must be in House 2, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
3. The flutist lives in the third house.
4. The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other, so the cellist must live in the second house.
5. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house (Clue 15).
6. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other (Clue 5).

12. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house (Clue 4).
13. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist (Clue 14).

From Clue 11, the person who owns a sedan must be in the first or third house. Since the third house is occupied by the flutist, the sedan owner must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this, let's carefully analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in House 3 (since there is no house to the left of House 3), and the person who likes white must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 2 is already taken by the person who likes red, the person who likes white must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 2: Red
   - House 1: White

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

7. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - This is already confirmed as House 3.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This is already confirmed as House 1.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.
- The person who has a television must be in House 4.
- The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who has a phone must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following placements:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1.
2. The bird keeper lives in house number 2.
3. The person who had pizza lives in house number 3.
4. The person who owns horses lives in house number 4.

Given these placements, the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (house 1).
5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other.

Given Clue 4, the saxophonist lives in house 1. From Clue 1, the tea drinker and the person eating grapes must be in houses 1 and 2. From Clue 3, the baseball player and the person eating grapes must also be in houses 1 and 2. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the tea drinker and the baseball player.

From Clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 1, and the golfer must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Based on the given clues and logical deductions, the person who likes red lives in the second house. Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The person wearing boots lives in the first house (Clue 3 and Clue 4).
2. The person with the bouquet of daffodils also lives in the first house (Clue 4).
3. The second house cannot be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies (Clue 1) or the person wearing high heels (Clue 2).
4. The third house must be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies and the person wearing high heels.

Given these points, the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the constraints and the detailed analysis, the tea drinker lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(D) 4"
"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following house assignments:

- House 2: Person 2

### Analyzing Clue 3

Clue 3 states that the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

### Analyzing Clue 1

Clue 1 states that the person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.
- If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) eats grapes.

### Analyzing Clue 2

Clue 2 states that the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader. This means:
- If Person 1 (House 1) wears boots, then Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.
- If Person 2 (House 2) wears boots, then Person 1 (House 1) is the mystery book reader.

### Combining Clues

From Clue 3, if Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck. This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow.
- Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.

From Clue 1, if Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes. This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.
- Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.

From Clue 2, if Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) wears boots. This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.
- Person 2 (House 2) wears boots.

Since Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck and Person 2 (House 2) wears boots, Person 2 (House 2) must be the mystery book reader. This leaves Person 1 (House 1) as the fantasy book enthusiast.

### Conclusion

The fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 1**.

"To avoid internet trolls on Reddit, you can employ several strategies:

1. **Ignore and Report**: Trolls often seek attention, so ignoring their posts and reporting them can help reduce their visibility.
2. **Use Filters and Subreddit Settings**: Some subreddits offer filters or settings that can minimize the number of troll posts you encounter.
3. **Stay Alert and Vigilant**: Be aware of troll behavior and be prepared to take action if necessary.
4. **Engage with Respect**: While engaging with trolls can sometimes defuse the situation, it's not always effective and can sometimes escalate the issue.
5. **Use Moderators**: If a troll is causing significant disruption, flagging the post or the user to the subreddit's moderators can help address the problem.

While these strategies can help, it's important to recognize that trolls are a part of the Reddit community and may always be present to some degree."

"To determine if The Jackson 5 was bigger than The Isley Brothers in terms of the family band concept, we need to consider the number of members in each group and their overall impact on the music industry.

The Jackson 5 consisted of Michael, Jermaine, Tito, Marlon, and Jackie Jackson, making it a quintet. The Isley Brothers, on the other hand, were a quartet, with O'Kelly, Ronald, Ernie, and Rudolph Isley.

While both bands were family units, The Jackson 5 had one additional member, giving it a slight edge in the number of family members involved. Additionally, The Jackson 5 achieved greater fame and success, with hits like ""I Want You Back"" and ""ABC,"" which significantly impacted the music industry.

Therefore, considering both the number of members and their impact, The Jackson 5 was indeed a bigger family band than The Isley Brothers.

"To address the question of whether a bull shark bite hurts worse than a crocodile bite, it's important to consider the nature of both bites and the potential severity of the injuries they can cause.

Bull sharks are known for their aggressive behavior and are capable of delivering powerful bites. Their powerful jaws and the fact that they can be found in various coastal and river environments mean that a bull shark bite can be quite severe, potentially causing significant tissue damage, infection, and other complications.

Crocodile bites, while also powerful, are generally more selective about their prey and are less likely to attack humans unless provoked or threatened. The severity of the bite can vary depending on the species and the size of the crocodile.

Given these factors, it is difficult to definitively say that one bite is necessarily worse than the other. Both can cause significant pain and injury. The severity of the injury would depend on various factors such as the size of the animal, the force of the bite, and the individual's response to the injury.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"

"To determine if a 500GB USB device is sufficient to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to consider the storage requirements for a single hour of Netflix content.

1. **Netflix Content Size**: Netflix typically streams content at a resolution of 1080p, which is a high-quality format. The size of a 1080p video file can vary, but generally, a single hour of high-quality video can range from 1.5GB to 3GB.

2. **Storage Requirement for 10 Hours**: If we take the average size of a 1080p video file as 2.5GB (a reasonable estimate), then 10 hours of video would require:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times 2.5 \text{ GB/hour} = 25 \text{ GB}
   \]

3. **Comparison with USB Capacity**: A 500GB USB device has a storage capacity of 500GB.

Since 25GB is significantly less than the 500GB capacity of the USB device, a 500GB USB device is more than enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day.

"To address the question effectively, we need to consider the anatomy of the human torso and the specific bones mentioned: the sternum (largest bone in the torso) and the stapes (smallest bone in the body).

The sternum is protected by the rib cage, which acts as a shield. This means that the sternum is well-protected from external blows.

On the other hand, the stapes, being the smallest bone in the body, is protected by the temporal bone of the skull. This bone structure effectively shields the stapes from external impacts.

Given these protective mechanisms, the torso is generally safe from blows to the sternum and the stapes.

"To address the question of whether Japanese serfdom had a higher status than English serfdom, it's important to understand the distinct characteristics of each system.

In Japan, the feudal system, known as the Bakufu system, was centered around the samurai class, who provided military service and were granted land. This system was more about military service and land grants rather than personal servitude. The samurai were not bound to the land in the same way as serfs in medieval England.

In contrast, English serfdom involved peasants who were bound to the land and required to work on the lord's land in exchange for protection and basic necessities. The status of serfs in England was generally lower than that of the nobility but higher than that of free peasants.

Given these differences, it is clear that the status of Japanese serfdom was not higher than that of English serfdom. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"
