"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Person who is wearing high heels.

2. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
9. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
11. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
12. **Clue 9**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person in the third house is wearing high heels, the third house is house number 3.

Now, let's use Clue 11 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the root beer lover and the person who is eating mangos. Since the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be next to each other.

Given that the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the coffee drinker, and the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3 and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(C) 2**."
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. The violinist lives in House 1.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 1.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.
4. The history book buff lives in House 3.
5. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
6. The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone live directly next to each other.
7. There is one house between where the person with a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.
8. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.

From these, we can deduce:
- House 1: Violinist (since the violinist lives in the first house)
- House 3: Fried rice eater (since the fried rice eater lives to the right of the percussionist and the history book buff lives to the right of the vase of tulips)
- House 2: Vase of tulips and phone (since they live next to each other and the history book buff lives in House 3)
- House 3: History book buff (since the history book buff lives to the right of the vase of tulips)
- House 2: Vase of tulips and phone
- House 1: Violinist
- House 3: Fried rice eater
- House 4: Radio (since there is one house between the radio and the history book buff, and the radio must be in House 2 or 3, but since the history book buff is in House 3, the radio must be in House 4)

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues, let's break down the information:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. This means the person driving a truck must live in house 1 because the person driving a truck is the only other car type left.

From Clue 1, the person driving a convertible must live directly left of the history book buff. Since the person driving a truck is in house 1, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2. Therefore, the history book buff must be in house 1.

This leaves the person in house 2 to be the mystery book reader, and the person in house 1 to be the sandals wearer.

Thus, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
The correct option is (B) 3.
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the person who likes yellow:
- Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2, they must be in either house 1 or house 3.

### Case 1: The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a gameboy must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who likes green).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

### Case 2: The person who likes yellow is in house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house (reaffirmed).
6. **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house (reaffirmed).
8. **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover is in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses. Since the root beer lover is in the third house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. However, the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, so the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the first and second houses.

From Clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in the second house. This means the history book buff must be in the first house.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house, so the tea drinker must be in the first house.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house, which is already occupied by the root beer lover. This means the person who likes red must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 2, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Since the root beer lover is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house numbers:

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
   - This means if the person with the radio is in house 1, the person who likes green must be in house 2.
   - If the person with the radio is in house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1.

2. **The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.

3. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the fish enthusiast must live in house 2.

4. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who had pizza must live in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The fish enthusiast lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The person who had pizza lives in house 2.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
  - Since the person who likes green lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), the person who has a radio must live in house 1 (since house 1 is directly left of house 2).

So, we have:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who had pizza (in house 2) and the person who likes green (in house 2) are already determined, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in house 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in house 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in house 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Based on the given clues and deductions, the person who only drinks water lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

"The person who had stew lives in house 4. 

So, the correct answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues and the logical deductions, the correct house where the fish enthusiast lives is house 5. However, since the options provided are (A) 2, (B) 3, (C) 1, (D) 4, and house 5 is not an option, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or a typo in the options. 

Based on the options provided, none directly match the correct answer. But if we had to choose from the given options, the closest logical deduction would be:

The number of the house where the fish enthusiast lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 has a phone.

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 does not wear boots.

3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person with horses lives in house 1 and the person with a radio lives in house 2, or vice versa.

From Clue 1, we know the person in house 1 has a phone. From Clue 2, the person in house 2 does not wear boots. From Clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other.

Since the person in house 1 has a phone, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

The characteristics are:
- House 1: Owns horses, wears high heels, has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots, has a phone.

Thus, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"The bird keeper lives in House 1.

So, the correct option is (D) 1."
"The soccer player lives in house 1. 

So, the correct option is:
(A) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The cat lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives.
8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and is directly left of the person who had fried rice. This means the person who had fried rice lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live next to each other. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must be in the first and second houses. Given that the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house, the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

From Clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had fried rice is in the second house, the person who had stew must be in the first house, but we already know the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house. This means the person who had stew must be in the fourth house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had stew is in the fourth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fifth house, and the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the bird keeper is in the fourth house, the person who has a television must be in the third house.

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a television is in the third house, the person who owns horses must be in the second house, and the person who has a gameboy must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who owns horses
- House 4: Person who has a television
- House 5: Person who had stew

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Pianist does not live in the first house.**
2. **Person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.**
3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other, and the person eating kiwis must be to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist next to each other, and the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio next to each other.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, we need to place the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist next to each other, and the person eating oranges is directly left of the person with a television.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

All clues are satisfied with this arrangement. Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 8.

So, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"The basketball player lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 5.

So, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 10:** The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.
   - Tea drinker in house 4.

2. **Clue 3:** The saxophonist lives in the second house.
   - Saxophonist in house 2.

3. **Clue 8:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the pizza eater must be in house 3 or 4. But since the tea drinker is in house 4, the pizza eater must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the cellist and the person who ate fried rice must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - This means the person who only drinks water and the person who is wearing loafers must be in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 5:** The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 4, the cellist must be in house 3.

7. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the pizza eater is in house 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

8. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the person who likes milk must be in a house to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.

9. **Clue 4:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2 or 3. But since the saxophonist is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

10. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
    - Since the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 2. This means the person who likes milk must be in house 3 or 4. But since the pizza eater is in house 3, the person who likes milk must be in house 4.

11. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - Since the person who is wearing sandals is in house 2, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1. This means the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 3.

12. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
    - Since the cellist is in house 3, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 4.

From the above analysis, we can conclude that the cellist lives in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the cellist lives is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
6. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the minivan driver lives in house 4. From Clue 10, the root beer lover lives in house 3. Now, let's use Clue 8 to determine the position of the basketball player and the truck driver. Since the basketball player lives directly left of the truck driver, and the truck driver must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover (house 3), the truck driver must be in house 2 and the basketball player in house 1.

From Clue 3, the swimmer lives directly left of the sedan owner. Since the swimmer is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2. This means house 2 is occupied by the swimmer and the sedan owner.

From Clue 4, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the truck driver is in house 2, the person with carnations must be in house 3. The root beer lover is in house 3, so the person with carnations must be in house 4.

From Clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other. Since the root beer lover is in house 3 and the person with carnations is in house 4, the daffodils and lilies must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the sedan owner is in house 2, the daffodils must be in house 3 and the lilies in house 2.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies (in house 2) lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (in house 1). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From Clue 6, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the tennis player is in house 1 and the tea drinker must be in a house to the right of the tennis player, the tea drinker must be in house 4.

From Clue 7, the swimmer does not live in the first house, which is consistent with the swimmer being in house 1.

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

The correct answer is **(D) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - Tea drinker in house 1.

2. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.

4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.

5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 1, the tea drinker is in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.
- From Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.
- From Clue 5, the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's test the possible positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1 (Clue 5), then the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

(A) 3"
"The root beer lover lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"The science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 4"
"The person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house (number 2). 

So, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The violinist lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house number 5.

So, the correct option is (E) 5."
"The person who has a computer lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
   - This means the golfer must be in House 2 and the science fiction book fanatic in House 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - This means the pizza-eater and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1, the pizza-eater and the history book buff must be in House 1 and House 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means the guitarist and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

Given these constraints, let's place the people:

- **House 1:** Science fiction book fanatic (SFF)
- **House 2:** Pizza-eater (PE), Golfer (G), History book buff (HBB), Person with bouquet of daffodils (D), Guitarist (Guitarist)

Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1, the pizza-eater and the history book buff must be in House 2. The guitarist must be to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the guitarist.

Thus, the only feasible arrangement is:
- **House 1:** SFF
- **House 2:** PE, Golfer (G), HBB, D, Guitarist

Since the percussionist (Perc) is not mentioned in the clues, and the only person left in House 2 is the guitarist, the percussionist must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"

2. **House 2: Phone**

3. **House 3: Television**

4. **House 4: Violinist (since the violinist lives in house 4)**

5. **House 5: Bird keeper**

Now, we need to place the remaining people and devices:

"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Lilies

2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 1 and Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples and also to the right of the violinist.
   - This implies that the person eating apples must be to the left of the violinist, and the person with the radio must be to the right of both.

Given these points, we can deduce:
- House 1: Lilies (person with the bouquet of lilies)
- House 2: The basketball player (since they cannot be in house 1)
- House 2: Violinist (since they must be to the right of the person eating apples and the radio holder)

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"The cricketer lives in the 2nd house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

From Clue 2, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

Let's summarize the information:
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- First house: root beer lover (since the root beer lover does not live in the first house and the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio, the root beer lover must be in the first house)
- Second house: tea drinker (since the tea drinker must be somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk, and the root beer lover is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the second house)
- First house: root beer lover
- Second house: tea drinker
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk (since the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in the fifth house)
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk

- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who had stew
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Seventh house: person who had stew

- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From the above analysis, the person with the computer lives directly left of the person with the gameboy. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with the radio lives in the third house, and the person with the loafers lives in the third house, the person with the gameboy must be in the second house, and the person with the computer must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the first house.

2. The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).

From the first clue, if the person who ate fried rice is in house 2, then the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1. This is because the fried rice eater is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

- The pianist lives in house 1.
- The root beer lover lives in house 2.
- The person who owns horses lives in house 1 (since the root beer lover is to the right of the person who owns horses, and the root beer lover is in house 2).

Since the person who owns horses is in house 1, they are the dog owner. The person who likes white cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

5. **Clue 4**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

6. **Clue 1**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

7. **Clue 3**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater
- The guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.
- The percussionist and science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

Let's place the known elements:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater

Since the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively, and the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, the only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."

2. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement looks like this:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

   - This means the person wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

3. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water lives in house 1. From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2. This means the person who likes milk must be in house 3 because there is one house between house 1 and house 3. 

Now, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house number 1.

- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: History book buff

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in house 1, so they must live in either house 2 or house 3. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes green must be to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in house 3, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This is consistent with the arrangement we have.

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know the fourth house is occupied by the mystery book reader and the saxophonist. Since the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other, the violinist must be in the third house.

Now, let's place the other clues:

- **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.
- **Clue 1:** The romance book lover (in the second house) lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.
- **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the guitarist must be in the fifth house, and the history book buff must be in the first house.

4. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given the coffee drinker is in house 4, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3, and the swimmer in house 2.
5. **Clue 14**: The basketball player lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the basketball player is in house 2, and the person who only drinks water is in house 3.

7. **Clue 12**: The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. This is consistent with the previous clues.
8. **Clue 11**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who owns an SUV must be in house 1 or 5. Since the radio is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 5.
9. **Clue 8**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes milk is in house 5, and the person who likes yellow is in house 4.

From the above deductions, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is **4**.

The correct answer is (E) 4."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. This means the tulip person can only live in houses 1 or 2.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. This means the rose bouquet person can only be in house 1 or 3.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:
  - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the refined approach, let's deduce the correct house for the person who likes milk.

1. **House 4: Lilies**
2. **House 5: Tulips**
3. **House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
4. **House 2: Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
5. **House 1: Fantasy Book Enthusiast or Root Beer Lover**
6. **House 3: History Book Buff**
7. **House 4: Cellist**
8. **House 5: Violinist**
9. **House 3: Pianist or Mystery Book Reader**
10. **House 4: Carnations Arrangement**
11. **House 5: Rose Bouquet**
12. **House 4: Milk Lover**

From the clues, we can deduce that the person who likes milk lives in House 4. The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other, and the carnations arrangement is in House 4.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **First house**: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
2. **Fourth house**: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Third house**: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
4. **Second house**: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Given the constraints, the only possible positions for the swimmer and the cricketer are:
- Cricketer in the first house (yellow), and swimmer in the third house (blue).
- Cricketer in the third house (blue), and swimmer in the first house (yellow).

Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the cricketer must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house.

Now, the second house must be occupied by the person who likes white and the person who is eating oranges. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (yellow), and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the first house (yellow). Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.

This leaves the person who owns an SUV in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The correct answer is (D) 2."
"The person who likes blue lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (number 1), which contradicts the fantasy book enthusiast. Therefore, we need to reassess. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house, and the cellist must live in the second house (number 2).
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (who likes green) lives in the first house, the person who likes red must live in the second house (number 2).

This means:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green.
- The person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

Now, we need to determine the mystery book reader. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green and the person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

Let's consider the possible arrangements:

- If Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals, then Person 2 (House 2) must own horses.
- If Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals, then Person 1 (House 1) must own horses.

From Clue 2:

1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).
4. **Tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the tennis player is in house \(i+1\) or later.
5. **There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet**: This means if the rose bouquet is in house \(i\), the daffodils are in house \(i+1\) or \(i-1\).
6. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\).

### Analyzing the Clues:
- **Clue 6**: Rose bouquet in house 3.
- **Clue 4**: Fantasy book enthusiast in house 2 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer).

### Placing the People:
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player (since the tennis player does not live in house 4, and the only available house is house 4).
- House 1: Mystery book reader (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

### Final Placement:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.

Let's start by placing the saxophonist in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Saxophonist

Next, we place the cellist and the person who ate spaghetti next to each other (Clue 3).

- House 2: Cellist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti

Now, the person who likes yellow must be somewhere to the left of the saxophonist (Clue 8).

Thus, the percussionist lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 4."
"The person who likes white lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (A) 1.
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"The person who drives a minivan lives in house number 1.

"The dog owner lives in house 3.

So, the correct option is:
(B) 3"
"The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

So, the correct option is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues to determine where the person who had pizza lives:

1. **Carnations in House 1.**
2. **Apples in House 2.**
3. **Banana not between pianist and pizza.**
4. **Pianoist not in House 5.**
5. **Guitarist not in House 3.**
6. **Pizza to the right of Saxophonist.**
7. **Banana not in House 4.**
8. **Mango not in House 4.**
9. **Stew and Grilled Cheese next to each other.**
10. **Daffodils to the left of Roses.**
11. **Banana between Pianoist and Pizza.**
12. **Pizza not in House 5.**

From Clue 1, we know the first house has carnations.

From Clue 2, the second house has apples.

From Clue 11, the banana must be between the pianist and the pizza. Since the pianist cannot be in House 5 (Clue 4), and the banana cannot be in House 4 (Clue 7), the only possible positions for the banana are in House 3 or House 4. However, since the banana must be between the pianist and the pizza, and the pianist cannot be in House 5, the banana must be in House 3, and the pizza must be in House 4.

From Clue 12, the pizza cannot be in House 5.

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. **Clue 12**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. **Clue 11**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to place the person who had pizza and the person who ate spaghetti. Since there is one house between the history book buff and the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house, and the person who had pizza must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
1. Pizza
2. History book buff
3. Spaghetti
4. ?

Next, let's use Clue 13 to place the guitarist and the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist is directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips, the guitarist must be in the first house, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house.

1. Pizza
2. Guitarist
3. Spaghetti
4. Flutist

Now, let's use Clue 11 to place the person who ate spaghetti and the percussionist. Since the percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house, the percussionist must be in the second house.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

- **Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2, so the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
6. The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
8. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
9. The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
10. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
11. The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
12. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

From Clue 7, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese.

From Clue 11, there is one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who has a television. This means the person who ate fried rice and the person who has a television must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese, the person who has a television must be in the third house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 8, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This confirms that the third house is occupied by the person who likes red.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house, so the second house is occupied by the person who likes red.

From Clue 10, the person who has a television lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the second house is occupied by the person who likes red, the person who likes yellow must be in the first house.

From Clue 4, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper. Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and the second house is occupied by the person who likes red, the bird keeper must be in the first house and the cat lover must be in the third house.

From Clue 3, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner. Since the second house is occupied by the person who likes red and the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the dog owner must be in the first house and the person who ate fried rice must be in the second house.

From Clue 12, there is one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who has a television. This confirms that the second house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice and the third house is occupied by the person who has a television.

From Clue 1, the bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other. Since the bird keeper is in the first house and the person who has a television is in the third house, this is consistent.

From Clue 2, the person who likes green does not live in the second house, so the second house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice, and the person who likes green must be in the fourth house.

"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the root beer lover lives is:

(A) 1"
"The person who has the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4."
"The pianist lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2."
"The person who ate fried rice lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people. From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues:

1. The coffee drinker (CD) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW).
2. The science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in the first house (house 1).

From Clue 2, we know the SF lives in house 1. This means the CD cannot be in house 1, so the CD must be in house 2. Consequently, the SW must be in house 1 because the CD is to the left of the SW.

This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to the remaining houses. Since the CD is in house 2, the water drinker must be in house 1. Therefore, the romance book lover must be in house 2.

Thus, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.
   - If the person drinking water is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means if the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person liking yellow must be in house 2.
   - If the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person liking yellow must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

So, we have:
- House 1: Person drinking water, Person wearing sandals
- House 2: Person eating kiwis, Person liking yellow

Since the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house (Clue 3).
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist (Clue 1).
3. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives (Clue 2).
4. The violinist does not live in the third house (Clue 4).

From Clue 3, we know:
- House 1 is occupied by the tea drinker.
- The cellist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 2.
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), so the violinist must be in house 2 (but that's already taken by the cellist), so the violinist must be in house 3.
- The guitarist must be in house 2 (since the cellist is in house 2 and there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 4"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza

2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
   - Radio cannot be in house 4.

3. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Grilled cheese and spaghetti must be adjacent.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
   - Gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house.

5. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
   - Grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house.

6. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - Television and phone must be in houses with television to the left of phone.

Let's place the pizza in house 4:
- House 4: Pizza

Now, let's place the radio and grilled cheese:
- Radio cannot be in house 4, so it must be in house 1 or 2.
- Grilled cheese must be adjacent to spaghetti, so if radio is in house 1, grilled cheese must be in house 2, and if radio is in house 2, grilled cheese must be in house 3.

Let's try house 1 for radio:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza

Now, we need to place the gameboy and fried rice:
- Gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house.
- If gameboy is in house 2, fried rice must be in house 3.
- If gameboy is in house 3, fried rice must be in house 4 (but house 4 is occupied by pizza).

So, gameboy must be in house 2 and fried rice in house 3:
- House 2: Gameboy
- House 3: Fried rice

Now, we need to place the computer and the television:
- Computer and television must be separated by one house.
- Computer cannot be in house 4 (pizza), so it must be in house 1 or 5.
- Television must be in house 2 or 3 (but house 2 is occupied by gameboy and house 3 is occupied by fried rice).

So, computer must be in house 1 and television in house 5:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Gameboy
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Television

Finally, the only person left is the one who ate spaghetti, and they must be adjacent to the grilled cheese in house 2:
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Television
- House 1: Computer
- House 3: Spaghetti

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

17. **Pianist Not in Third House**: The pianist does not live in the third house.
18. **Apples and Golfer**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
19. **Pizza and Fifth House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:
- The bird keeper lives in the second house.
- The tennis player lives in the first house.
- The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
- The pianist does not live in the third house.
- The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other.
- The saxophonist and the golfer live one house apart.
- The basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover.
- The person who is eating a banana lives directly next to the person who had stew.
- The person who is eating oranges lives directly next to the person who ate fried rice.
- The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.

Given that the pianist lives in the third house (from clue 17 and 18), the person who is eating a banana must live in the fifth house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is **5**."
"The person who had pizza lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in house number 3.

(A) 3"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3**: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4**: The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. **Clue 6**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. **Clue 8**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 10, we know the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses respectively, or the third and first houses respectively. Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in the second house (Clue 3), the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Now, let's place the fish enthusiast and the person eating a banana. From Clue 5, the fish enthusiast must be to the right of the person eating a banana. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person eating a banana must be in the first house.

So, the first house is occupied by the person eating a banana, and the third house is occupied by the flutist.

Next, we need to place the percussionist, the pianist, and the person wearing running shoes. From Clue 2, the percussionist cannot be in the second house. From Clue 4, the history book buff cannot be in the second house. From Clue 8, the fish enthusiast (in the third house) must be to the right of the person wearing running shoes. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person wearing running shoes must be in the first house, but we already know the first house is occupied by the person eating a banana. Therefore, the person wearing running shoes must be in the second house.

Now, the second house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes. The first house is occupied by the person eating a banana, and the third house is occupied by the flutist.

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who is eating oranges. From Clue 1, the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house. From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges must be to the right of the pianist. Since the flutist is in the third house, the pianist must be in the second house, and the person eating oranges must be in the first house, but we already know the first house is occupied by the person eating a banana. Therefore, the person eating oranges must be in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by the person eating a banana, the second house is occupied by the person wearing running shoes, the third house is occupied by the flutist, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house.

The number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is **3**.

**Final Answer: (C) 3**"
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3** states that the root beer lover lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes root beer.
2. **Clue 2** tells us that the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water.
3. **Clue 4** indicates that the person who has a television does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a television must live in the first house. But we already know the first house is occupied by the root beer lover. Therefore, the person who has a television must live in the third house.
4. **Clue 5** states that the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a television lives in the third house, the person with the vase of tulips must live in the second house. But we already know the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person with the vase of tulips must live in the first house, which contradicts Clue 3. This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in the third house, and the person who has a television must live in the second house.
5. **Clue 1** states that the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who only drinks water lives in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in the first house, and the person who has a phone must live in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water (bouquet of daffodils)
- House 2: Person who likes root beer (bouquet of tulips)

"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - This clue is consistent with the arrangement where the root beer lover is in house 1 and the guitarist is in house 2.

From the above, we can deduce:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the only possible adjacent houses are the second and third houses.

From Clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in the third house, and the history book buff must live in the second house.

This leaves the romance book lover to live in the first house, but we already know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader. Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the third house.

So, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."

From Clue 3, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 1 or 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 6, the person eating kiwis cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2 or 4. Since the mangos eater is in house 4, the kiwis eater must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be to the left of the person drinking water. This means the apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the mangos eater is in house 4, the apple eater must be in house 1 and the water drinker in house 2.

This leaves house 3 for the tea drinker.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Person drinking tea
- House 4: Person eating apples

3. Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. Since the truck is in house 3, the gameboy must be in house 2.
4. Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 3.
5. Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person with the television must be in house 1 and the person with high heels must be in house 2.
6. Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the SUV lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the root beer lover).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan driver cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the minivan driver).

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.
- The truck driver is to the right of the root beer lover.
- The minivan driver is not in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

(A) 3"
"The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in House 3 (since there is no house to the left of House 3), and the person who likes white must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 2 is already taken by the person who likes red, the person who likes white must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 2: Red
   - House 1: White

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

7. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - This is already confirmed as House 3.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This is already confirmed as House 1.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.
- The person who has a television must be in House 4.
- The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who has a phone must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"The bird keeper lives in house number 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the saxophonist and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (house 1).
   - Therefore, the saxophonist is in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 4, we know the saxophonist is in house 1. From Clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the baseball player and house 2 for the person eating grapes.

Now, combining Clue 1 and Clue 3:
- The tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.
- The baseball player and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 1. This leaves house 2 for the baseball player.

So, the assignments are:
- House 1: Tea drinker, Baseball player
- House 2: Person eating grapes, Golfer

Since the person eating mangos is not mentioned in any clue, and the person eating grapes is in house 2, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Based on the given clues, the correct house number where the romance book lover lives is (B) 2."
"The person wearing boots lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"Given the constraints and the detailed analysis, the tea drinker lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(D) 4"
"The person who likes green lives in house number 4.

So, the correct answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the house where the person who ate fried rice lives:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips cannot live in the second house (Clue 14).
4. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house (Clue 14).
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan (Clue 10).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck (Clue 3).
7. The person who drives a truck does not live in the second house (Clue 1).
8. The person who drives a minivan does not live in the third house (Clue 2).
9. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house (Clue 11).
10. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player (Clue 7).
11. The person who drives a minivan and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other (Clue 8).
12. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover (Clue 9).
13. The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan (Clue 10).
14. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house (Clue 14).
15. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player (Clue 15).

From Clue 11, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house. From Clue 14, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover. From Clue 10, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.

Given these constraints, let's place the people:

- Tulips (first house) and spaghetti (first house) are already placed.
- The person who has a rose bouquet must be to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
- The person who has a rose bouquet cannot be in the second house (Clue 14).
- The person who has a rose bouquet must be in the third or fourth house.
- The person who has a rose bouquet cannot be in the second house (Clue 14).
- The person who has a rose bouquet must be to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
- The person who has a rose bouquet must be to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
- The person who has a rose bouquet must be to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
- The person who has a rose bouquet must be to the right of the person who owns a sedan.

Given the constraints, the only place for the person who ate fried rice is the first house. Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

From Clue 3, if Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck. If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck. This creates a contradiction because Person 1 cannot like yellow and drive a truck simultaneously. Therefore, Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow.

So, Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow. This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.
- Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.

From Clue 1, since Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes. This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) eats oranges (since Person 2 eats grapes).

From Clue 2, since Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, Person 2 (House 2) wears boots. This means:
- Person 1 (House 1) wears running shoes (since Person 2 wears boots).

Finally, the remaining characteristics are:
- Person 1 (House 1) likes red.
- Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow.
- Person 1 (House 1) eats oranges.
- Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- Person 1 (House 1) wears running shoes.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.

The only remaining characteristic is the fantasy book enthusiast. Since Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader, Person 1 (House 1) must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 1**.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Based on the given clues and the deductions made, the person who ate fried rice lives in House 5.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
**(B) 5**"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house where the person who had pizza lives:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house (house 1).
   - House 1: Spaghetti

2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in house 2 and the romance book lover lives in house 3.

   - House 1: Spaghetti
   - House 2: White
   - House 3: Romance book lover

3. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes green lives in house 2 and the person who likes red lives in house 3.

   - House 1: Spaghetti
   - House 2: Green
   - House 3: Red

4. There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - Since the person who likes red lives in house 3, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house 4.

   - House 1: Spaghetti
   - House 2: Green
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

5. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the person who had pizza lives in house 3 and the basketball player lives in house 4.

   - House 1: Spaghetti
   - House 2: Green
   - House 3: Pizza
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

6. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
   - The person who ate grilled cheese must live in house 2 or house 4. Since house 4 is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in house 2.

   - House 1: Spaghetti
   - House 2: Grilled cheese
   - House 3: Pizza
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

7. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the percussionist lives in house 2 and the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

   - House 1: Spaghetti

   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

8. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue.

9. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes green lives in house 2 and the person who likes blue lives in house 3.

   - House 2: Green
   - House 3: Blue
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

10. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.

   - House 1: Spaghetti
   - House 2: Green
   - House 3: Pizza
   - House 4: Basketball player

11. The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
   - This means the violinist lives in house 1 and the person who likes blue lives in house 2.

   - House 1: Violinist
   - House 2: Grilled cheese
   - House 3: Pizza
   - House 4: Basketball player

From the analysis, we can see that the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The basketball player lives in the second house.
   - This means House 2 is occupied by the basketball player.

2. **Clue 3:** The violinist lives in the second house.
   - This is a contradiction because the violinist and the basketball player both live in House 2. However, since the violinist is mentioned first, it implies the violinist is in House 2.

3. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
   - Since the violinist is in House 2, the cricketer and the cellist must be in Houses 1 and 3, respectively, with the cellist to the right of the cricketer.

So, the arrangement is:
