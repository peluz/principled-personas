"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people in the houses step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
9. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
11. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
12. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person in the third house is wearing high heels, the third house is house number 3.

Now, let's use Clue 11 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the root beer lover and the person who is eating mangos. Since the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be next to each other.

Given that the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the coffee drinker, and the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3 and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(B) 2**."
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. The violinist lives in House 1.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 1.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.
4. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
7. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.
8. The violinist lives in the first house.

From these, we can deduce:
- House 1: Violinist (and also the person who ate spaghetti)
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice (and also the history book buff)
- House 2: Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone (since they must be next to each other)

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist and the violinist is in House 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1. This leaves House 2 for the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips must live in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues, let's break down the information:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. This means the person driving a truck must live in house 1 because the person driving a truck is the only other car type left.

From Clue 1, the person driving a convertible must live directly left of the history book buff. Since the person driving a truck is in house 1, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2. Therefore, the history book buff must be in house 1.

This leaves the person in house 2 to be the mystery book reader, and the person in house 1 to be the sandals wearer.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."

"The person who has a computer lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house (reaffirmed).
8. **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses. Since the root beer lover is in the third house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. However, the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, so the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the first and second houses.

From Clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in the first house. Therefore, the romance book lover must live in the second house, and the history book buff must live in the first house.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house, which is already occupied by the root beer lover. This means the red drinker must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the romance book lover, the tea drinker must live in the first house.

From Clue 2, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Since the tea drinker is in the first house and the root beer lover is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the fourth house, and the person who likes green must be in the second house.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."

Based on the options provided, none directly match the correct answer. But if we had to choose from the given options, the closest logical deduction would be:

The number of the house where the fish enthusiast lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 has a phone.

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 does not wear boots.

3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person with horses lives in house 1 and the person with a radio lives in house 2, or vice versa.

From Clue 1, we know the person in house 1 has a phone. From Clue 2, the person in house 2 does not wear boots. From Clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other.

Since the person in house 1 has a phone, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

The characteristics are:
- House 1: Owns horses, wears high heels, has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots, has a phone.

Thus, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

From Clue 4, the person who is eating apples must live in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house.

From Clue 8, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow must live in the third house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the second house.

"The bird keeper lives in House 1.

So, the correct option is (D) 1."
"The soccer player lives in house 1. 

So, the correct option is:
(A) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The cat lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives.
8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and is directly left of the person who had fried rice. Therefore, the person who had fried rice must live in the second house.

From Clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live next to each other. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must be in the first and second houses. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house, the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

From Clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had fried rice is in the second house, the person who had stew must be in the first house, but we already know the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house. This means the person who had stew must be in the fourth house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had stew is in the fourth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fifth house, and the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the bird keeper is in the fourth house, the person who has a television must be in the third house.

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a television is in the third house, the person who owns horses must be in the second house, and the person who has a gameboy must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is as follows:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who owns horses
- House 4: Person who has a television
- House 5: Person who had stew

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Pianist does not live in the first house.**
2. **Person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.**
3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other. Also, the person eating kiwis must be to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist next to each other. Also, the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio must be next to each other.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, the person eating oranges must be directly left of the person with a television.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Thus, the person with a television lives in house 8.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"The cellist lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3."

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
6. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the minivan driver lives in house 4. From Clue 10, the root beer lover lives in house 3. Now, let's use Clue 8 to determine the position of the basketball player and the truck driver. Since the basketball player lives directly left of the truck driver, and the truck driver must be in house 1 (as house 4 is taken by the minivan driver), the basketball player must be in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the truck driver.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Truck driver
- House 2: Basketball player
- House 3: Root beer lover
- House 4: Minivan driver

From Clue 3, the swimmer lives directly left of the sedan owner. Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 2 (already occupied by the basketball player), and the sedan owner must be in house 4 (minivan driver). This leaves house 1 for the truck driver.

From Clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other. Since the root beer lover is in house 3 and the sedan owner (sedan driver) is in house 4, the daffodils and lilies must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the basketball player is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3) lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (house 2). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player must be in houses that are not adjacent. Since the root beer lover is in house 3 and the sedan owner is in house 4, the coffee drinker and the tennis player must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the truck driver is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 and the tennis player must be in house 2.

From Clue 6, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the tennis player is in house 2 and the root beer lover is in house 3, the tea drinker must be in house 4.

Thus, the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(A) 1**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - Tea drinker in house 1.

2. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.

4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.

5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 1, the tea drinker is in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.
- From Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.
- From Clue 5, the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's test the possible positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1 (Clue 5), then the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

Given Clue 4, the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

(A) 3"
"The root beer lover lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"The science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 4"
"The person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house (number 2). 

So, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The violinist lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house number 5.

So, the correct option is (E) 5."
"The person who has a computer lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic (SFF) lives somewhere to the left of the golfer (Golfer).
   - This means the golfer must be in House 2 and the SFF in House 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) live directly next to each other.
   - This means PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses. Since the golfer is in House 2, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist (G) lives somewhere to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils (D).
   - This means G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D. Since the golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 2 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"
"Given the clues and the constraints, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **House 1: Dog owner (since the dog owner is not in house 2)**

2. **House 2: Phone**

3. **House 3: Television**

4. **House 4: Violinist (since the violinist lives in house 4)**

5. **House 5: Bird keeper**

Now, we need to place the remaining people and devices:
- The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses are neighbors.
- The flutist and the person who has a television are neighbors.
- The television is to the left of the radio.
- The guitarist is to the right of the percussionist.

"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Lilies

2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - This means the basketball player must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 1 and Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples and also to the right of the violinist.
   - Since the basketball player lives in house 2, and the person eating apples must be to the left of the violinist, the person eating apples must live in house 1.
   - Therefore, the violinist must live in house 2.

From the above deductions, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is **(B) 2**."
"The cricketer lives in the 2nd house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues, let's break down the information:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

1. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

7. **Clue 3**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.

- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater
- The guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.
- The percussionist and science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

Let's place the known elements:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater

Since the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively, and the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, the only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement looks like this:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

   - This means the person who likes white and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).

- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water lives in house 1. From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2. This means the person who likes milk must be in house 3, as there is one house between house 1 and house 3. 

Now, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and since the romance book lover is directly left of the history book buff, the only possible arrangement for houses 2 and 3 is:
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: History book buff

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in house 1, so the person who had pizza must live in either house 2 or house 3. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who ate fried rice must live somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 3.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"The person who has a computer lives in house 2. 

So, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who is wearing sandals lives in house number 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"The person who had stew lives in house 1.

So, the correct option is:
(A) 1"

"The person who is eating oranges lives in house number 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"The person who is eating apples lives in house 2. 

So, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"The person who had pizza lives in House 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know the fourth house is occupied by the mystery book reader and the saxophonist. Since the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other, the violinist must be in the third house.

Now, let's place the other characteristics:

- The saxophonist is in the fourth house.
- The violinist is in the third house.
- The mystery book reader is in the fourth house (already placed).

Next, we need to place the history book buff and the guitarist. Clue 2 states there is one house between the history book buff and the guitarist. Since the saxophonist and violinist are already placed, the only possible positions for the history book buff and the guitarist are the first and second houses or the second and third houses. However, the second house is occupied by the romance book lover, so the history book buff must be in the first house and the guitarist in the second house.

Now, we need to place the romance book lover and the fantasy book enthusiast. Clue 1 states the romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

So, the final positions are:
- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Romance book lover
- **House 3:** Violinist
- **House 4:** Saxophonist (mystery book reader)
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

(B) 2"
"The person who had pizza lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 3."
"The person who is eating apples lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 15:** The person who has a radio lives in the first house (house 1).
2. **Clue 5:** The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house (house 4).
3. **Clue 16:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in house 4, the person with a television must be in house 5.
4. **Clue 17:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given the coffee drinker is in house 4, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3, and the swimmer must be in house 2.
5. **Clue 14:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the basketball player must be in house 2, and the person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
6. **Clue 13:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. This means the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2, and the root beer lover must be in house 3.
7. **Clue 12:** The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. This means the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2, and the basketball player must be in house 3.
8. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who owns an SUV must be in house 1.

11. **Clue 7:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. This means the person who owns a sedan must be in house 1, and the swimmer must be in house 2.
12. **Clue 9:** The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. This means the person who has a computer must be in house 1, 2, or 5. Given Clue 10, the person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who likes red must be in house 2, and the golfer must be in house 3.
13. **Clue 10:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who likes red must be in house 2, and the golfer must be in house 3.
14. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. This means the person who likes green must be in house 3, and the person who has a phone must be in house 4.
15. **Clue 2:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible. This means the person who drives a convertible must be in house 1, and the person who likes green must be in house 3.
16. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house. This means the person who only drinks water must be in house 2, 4, or 5. Given Clue 8, the person who likes milk must be in house 5, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. This leaves house 2 for the person who only drinks water.
17. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. This means the person who likes white must be in house 3, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4.

From the above deductions, the coffee drinker lives in house 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is **4**.

The correct answer is (E) 4."
"The person who drives a truck lives in house number 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 3"
"Given the constraints and the refined approach, let's deduce the correct house for the person who likes milk.

1. **House 4: Lilies**
2. **House 5: Tulips**
3. **House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
4. **House 2: Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
5. **House 1: Fantasy Book Enthusiast or Root Beer Lover**
6. **House 3: History Book Buff**
7. **House 4: Cellist**
8. **House 5: Violinist**
9. **House 3: Pianist**
10. **House 4: Mystery Book Reader**
11. **House 2: Romance Book Lover**
12. **House 1: Carnations Arrangement**
13. **House 4: Rose Bouquet**
14. **House 5: Milk Lover**

From the clues, we can deduce that the person who likes milk lives in House 5, as the violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water, and the person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other. Given that the violinist lives in House 5, the person who likes milk must live in House 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes milk lives is **4**.

The correct answer is (D) 4."
"The basketball player lives in the second house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2."
"The person who likes blue lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"The bird keeper lives in the second house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (number 1).
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. From clue 2, the cellist also lives in house 1. This creates a contradiction because only one person can live in each house. Therefore, we need to reassess.

If the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1, then the cellist must live in house 2. This means the person who likes green must live in house 1 (since they are to the left of the person who likes red).

So, the person who likes green lives in house 1 and likes red. The person who likes red must live in house 2. This means the person who likes green (living in house 1) likes red, and the person who likes red (living in house 2) likes green.

Now, the only person left is the mystery book reader, who must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the mystery book reader lives is 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the process of elimination, let's deduce the correct placement of the people in the houses. Here's a step-by-step deduction:

"The person who has a rose bouquet lives in house number 1.

(C) 1"
"Given the clues and the process of elimination, we can deduce the following arrangement:

- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who ate fried rice
- House 5: Person who likes yellow

From the clues, we know the percussionist must be directly left of the coffee drinker (Clue 10). Also, the coffee drinker must be directly left of the percussionist (Clue 10). This means the coffee drinker and percussionist must be in adjacent houses. Given the arrangement so far, the only possible positions for the coffee drinker and percussionist are House 4 and House 5, but since House 5 is already occupied by the person who likes yellow, the only possible position is House 4 for the coffee drinker and House 3 for the percussionist.

Thus, the percussionist lives in House 3.

The answer is (D) 3."
"The person who likes white lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (A) 1.
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"The person who drives a minivan lives in house number 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4. 

So, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"The dog owner lives in house 3.

So, the correct option is:
(B) 3"
"The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

So, the correct option is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues to determine where the person who had pizza lives:

1. **Carnations in House 1.**
2. **Apples in House 2.**
3. **Banana not between pianist and pizza.**
4. **Pianoist not in House 5.**
5. **Guitarist not in House 3.**
6. **Pizza to the right of Saxophonist.**
7. **Stew and Grilled Cheese next to each other.**
8. **Mango not in House 4.**
9. **Tulips not in House 3.**
10. **Daffodils next to Roses.**
11. **Banana between Pianoist and Pizza.**
12. **Pizza not in House 5.**

From Clue 11, the banana must be between the pianist and the person who had pizza. Given Clue 12, the pizza cannot be in House 5. Let's place the pianist and the banana:

- If the pianist is in House 1, the banana must be in House 2, and the pizza must be in House 3.
- If the pianist is in House 2, the banana must be in House 3, and the pizza must be in House 4.
- If the pianist is in House 3, the banana must be in House 4, and the pizza must be in House 5.
- If the pianist is in House 4, the banana must be in House 5, and the pizza must be in House 6 (but House 6 is not possible).

Given Clue 12, the pizza cannot be in House 5. So, the only possible positions for the pizza are House 3 or House 4.

From Clue 10, the daffodils must be next to the roses. Let's place the roses and daffodils:

- If the roses are in House 1, the daffodils must be in House 2.
- If the roses are in House 2, the daffodils must be in House 3.
- If the roses are in House 3, the daffodils must be in House 4.
- If the roses are in House 4, the daffodils must be in House 5.
- If the roses are in House 5, the daffodils must be in House 6 (but House 6 is not possible).

Given Clue 10, the roses and daffodils cannot be in House 5 or 6. So, the possible positions for the roses and daffodils are House 1-2, House 2-3, or House 3-4.

From Clue 13, the guitarist cannot be in House 3. Let's place the guitarist:

- If the guitarist is in House 1, the carnations are in House 1, and the roses and daffodils must be in House 2-3 or 2-4.
- If the guitarist is in House 2, the carnations are in House 1, and the roses and daffodils must be in House 3-4.
- If the guitarist is in House 3, the carnations are in House 1, and the roses and daffodils must be in House 4-5.
- If the guitarist is in House 4, the carnations are in House 1, and the roses and daffodils must be in House 5-6 (but House 6 is not possible).

Given Clue 13, the guitarist cannot be in House 3. So, the possible positions for the guitarist are House 1, 2, or 4.

From Clue 14, the person who had pizza must be to the right of the saxophonist. Let's place the saxophonist:

- If the saxophonist is in House 1, the pizza must be in House 2, 3, or 4.
- If the saxophonist is in House 2, the pizza must be in House 3 or 4.
- If the saxophonist is in House 3, the pizza must be in House 4.
- If the saxophonist is in House 4, the pizza must be in House 5.

Given Clue 14, the saxophonist cannot be in House 3. So, the possible positions for the saxophonist are House 1, 2, or 4.

From Clue 15, the person who had pizza cannot be in House 5. So, the possible positions for the pizza are House 3 or 4.

Given all these constraints, the only consistent placement is:

- Carnations in House 1.
- Apples in House 2.
- Bananas between the pianist and pizza.
- Daffodils next to roses.
- Guitarist not in House 3.
- Pizza to the right of saxophonist.
- Stew and grilled cheese next to each other.
- Mango not in House 4.
- Tulips not in House 3.
- Pianoist not in House 5.
- Pizza not in House 5.

Thus, the person who had pizza must be in House 4.

The number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is **4**.

**Final Answer: (D) 4**"
"Given the clues and the process of elimination, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. **Clue 12**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. **Clue 11**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 13**: The guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
5. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
6. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who likes green lives.
7. **Clue 3**: The history book buff lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 4**: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fourth house.
9. **Clue 5**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
10. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
11. **Clue 7**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
12. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
13. **Clue 1**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
14. **Clue 9**: The flutist does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the history book buff in the second house:
1. History book buff (2)

Next, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house:
4. Fantasy book enthusiast (4)

Now, let's place the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who ate fried rice. Since there is one house between the history book buff and the person who ate spaghetti, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice, we can place them as follows:
1. Pizza
2. Guitarist
3. Spaghetti
4. Flutist

This arrangement satisfies Clue 10 and Clue 14. Now, let's place the person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes yellow:
1. Pizza
2. Guitarist
3. Spaghetti
4. Flutist

Since the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow, we can place them as follows:
1. Pizza
2. Guitarist
3. Spaghetti
4. Flutist

Now, let's place the person who likes blue and the percussionist. Since the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist and the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza, we can place them as follows:
1. Pizza
2. Guitarist
3. Spaghetti
4. Flutist

This arrangement satisfies Clue 7 and Clue 6. Now, let's place the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow:
1. Pizza
2. Guitarist
3. Spaghetti
4. Flutist

Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes yellow, we can place them as follows:
1. Pizza
2. Guitarist
3. Spaghetti
4. Flutist

Finally, let's place the person who had pizza and the person who ate fried rice:
1. Pizza
2. Guitarist
3. Spaghetti
4. Flutist

This arrangement satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the person who lives in the fourth house is the one who has a bouquet of daffodils.

The number of the house where the cellist lives is **3**.

So, the correct answer is:
(B) 3"

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

- If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house where the person who likes red lives:

1. The person who likes red lives in the third house (Clue 8 and Clue 1).
2. The person who has a television lives in the third house (Clue 10).
3. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow (Clue 10).
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (Clue 2).
5. The person who has a television lives in the third house (Clue 10).

From these clues, we can conclude that the person who likes red lives in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is 3.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the root beer lover lives is:

(A) 1"
"The person who has the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4."
"The pianist lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2."
"The person who ate fried rice lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. The person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2 (Clue 5).
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives in house number 3 (Clue 4, since they live next to the person with the rose bouquet).
3. The romance book lover lives in house number 4 (Clue 2 and Clue 3, since they live to the right of the person with the carnations arrangement and directly left of the person with the vase of tulips).
4. The person with the carnations arrangement lives in house number 1 (Clue 2 and Clue 3).

This leaves house number 1 for the person with the carnations arrangement, house number 2 for the person with the rose bouquet, house number 3 for the science fiction book fanatic, and house number 4 for the person with the vase of tulips.

Since the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 4, the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in house number 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is (A) 1."
"The romance book lover lives in house 2.

So, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who has a phone lives in House 1. Therefore, the correct option is:

(A) 1"
"The person who likes yellow lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who owns horses lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"The person who drives a truck lives in House 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5."
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

(C) 3"
"The person with the carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.
   - If the person drinking water is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means if the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person liking yellow must be in house 2.
   - If the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person liking yellow must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

So, we have:
- House 1: Person drinking water, Person wearing sandals
- House 2: Person eating kiwis, Person liking yellow

Since the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
3. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
4. The violinist does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the tea drinker is in house 1. This leaves the second and third houses for the cellist and the person who only drinks water. From clue 2, the person who only drinks water must be in the third house, and the cellist must be in the second house.

This leaves the third house for the guitarist, and the violinist must be in the second house (since the violinist cannot be in the third house and there must be one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

Therefore, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 4"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza

2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
   - The radio cannot be in house 4.

3. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
   - This means the grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house.

5. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
   - This means the gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house.

6. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - The television and phone must be in houses with the television to the left of the phone.

Let's place the pizza in house 4:
- House 4: Pizza

Now, the radio cannot be in house 4, so it must be in one of houses 1, 2, 3, or 5. The grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house. Let's try placing the radio in house 1:
- House 1: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

This means the grilled cheese must be in house 2:
- House 2: Grilled Cheese
- House 1: Radio

Now, the gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house. The gameboy cannot be in house 1 (radio) or house 4 (pizza). Let's try placing the gameboy in house 3:
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 2: Grilled Cheese
- House 1: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

This means the fried rice must be in house 5:
- House 5: Fried Rice

Now, the computer and computer cannot be in house 4 (pizza) or house 3 (gameboy). Let's place the computer in house 2:
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 1: Radio
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried Rice

Finally, the phone and television must be in houses with the phone to the left of the television. The phone cannot be in house 4 (pizza) or house 5 (fried rice). Let's place the phone in house 1:
- House 1: Phone
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried Rice

This leaves the television in house 5:
- House 1: Phone
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Television

From this configuration, we can see that the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3, as it is directly left of the person who has a radio.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate spaghetti lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

13. **Saxophonist and Golfer**: There is one house between where the saxophonist lives and where the golfer lives.
14. **Mangos and Horse**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
15. **Tennis Player in First House**: The tennis player lives in the first house.
16. **Percussionist in Fourth House**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
17. **Pianist Not in Third House**: The pianist does not live in the third house.
18. **Apples and Golfer**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
19. **Pizza and Fifth House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 15, the tennis player lives in the first house. From clue 16, the percussionist lives in the fourth house. From clue 17, the pianist does not live in the third house. From clue 18, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. From clue 19, the person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

Given that the pianist does not live in the third house, and considering the positions of the other musicians and their pets, we can deduce the following:

- The pianist must live in the second house (since the bird keeper lives in the second house and the pianist cannot be in the third house).
- The person who is eating a banana must live somewhere to the right of the pianist, so the person who is eating a banana must live in the fourth or fifth house.
- The percussionist lives in the fourth house, so the person who is eating a banana must live in the fifth house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is **5**.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"The person who had pizza lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in house number 3.

(A) 3"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3**: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4**: The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. **Clue 6**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. **Clue 8**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 10, we know the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses respectively, or the third and first houses respectively. Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in the second house (Clue 3), the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Now, let's consider Clue 5 and Clue 8:
- The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
- The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

Since the fish enthusiast must be in the third house (flutist), the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the first house.

Now, we have:
- First house: Person wearing running shoes
- Second house: Person eating a banana
- Third house: Fish enthusiast (flutist)

This leaves the first and third houses for the remaining characteristics:
- First house: Person wearing loafers (since the person wearing loafers cannot be in the second house)
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast (fantasy book buff)

Since the person wearing loafers cannot be in the second house, and the person eating oranges must be to the right of the pianist, the only remaining house for the person eating oranges is the second house, and the pianist must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person wearing loafers (cat lover)
- Second house: Person eating a banana
- Third house: Fish enthusiast (flutist)

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4."
"The person who had stew lives in house 1.

(A) 2
(B) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means if the daffodils are in house 1, the phone must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes root beer lives in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person who has a television lives in either house 1 or house 3.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means if the person with the television is in house \(X\), the person with the vase of tulips must be in house \(X-1\).

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in house 1. From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2. From Clue 4, the person who has a television cannot live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or house 3. From Clue 5, if the person with the television lives in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 (which contradicts Clue 2). Therefore, the person with the television must live in house 3.

This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2. This leaves house 3 for the person who likes root beer.

Thus, the person who likes root beer lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"The person who has a computer lives in House 2.

5. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in house 2.

From Clue 3, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 1 or house 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 6, the person eating kiwis cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or house 2 or house 4. Since the coffee drinker is in house 2, the kiwi eater must be in house 1 or house 4. Given that the mangos eater is in house 4, the kiwi eater must be in house 1.

From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be to the left of the person drinking water. Since the mangos eater is in house 1 and the kiwi eater is in house 1, the apple eater must be in house 3 and the water drinker must be in house 4.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mangos eater
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Apple eater
- House 4: Water drinker

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"The person who is eating a banana lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"The correct option is (C) 1.

To elaborate on the reasoning without referencing the previous response:

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. Clue 6 tells us the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the flutist must be in house 1 and the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2.
2. Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. Therefore, the truck must be in house 3.
3. Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. Since the truck is in house 3, the gameboy must be in house 2.
4. Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 3.
5. Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person with the television must be in house 1 and the person with high heels must be in house 2.
6. Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 1."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their belongings:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house (house 5).
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (house 2).
3. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist, so the pianist must be in house 3.

5. **Clue 8**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pianist
- House 5: Grapes

Since the person who is eating grapes lives in house 5, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since they live directly left of the saxophonist, and the saxophonist must be in house 3).

Now, we need to place the remaining people:
- House 1: Violinist (since the violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other, and the violinist must be in house 1).
- House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pianist
- House 5: Grapes

The remaining person (the person who is eating mangos) must be in house 1 (since the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the violinist, and the violinist is in house 1).

Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in the first house, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the third or fourth house. The person who has a rose bouquet cannot be in the second house (Clue 14). Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the third house for the person who has a bouquet of lilies, the second house for the person who has a vase of tulips, and the first house for the person who has a rose bouquet.

Now, the person who has a rose bouquet (fourth house) must be to the right of the person who owns a sedan. The person who has a rose bouquet cannot be in the second house (Clue 14), so the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the fourth house. The person who owns a sedan must be in the third house.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in the third house, and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the fourth house.

The person who has a rose bouquet (fourth house) must be to the right of the person who owns a sedan (third house). The person who has a rose bouquet cannot be in the second house (Clue 14), so the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
   - This means the cricketer cannot be in House 3, because the cellist would then be in House 3, making the cellist to the left of the cricketer. Therefore, the cricketer must be in House 1, and the cellist must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer

"During the pandemic, door-to-door advertising can indeed be considered inconsiderate. Here’s why:

1. **Health Risks**: Door-to-door canvassing involves close contact with individuals, which can increase the risk of spreading the virus, especially if the person being approached is at higher risk due to age or pre-existing health conditions.

2. **Social Distancing**: The practice of door-to-door canvassing often involves standing close to people's homes, which goes against the social distancing guidelines recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.

3. **Public Health Concerns**: During a pandemic, public health officials are urging people to stay at home and limit their interactions to reduce the spread of the virus. Door-to-door canvassing can be seen as a disruption to this effort.
