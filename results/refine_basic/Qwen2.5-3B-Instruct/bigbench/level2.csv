Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

Let's start by placing the flutist in house number 2.

- **Clue 2** tells us that the person with a vase of tulips must be directly left of the guitarist. This means the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips must be adjacent, and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips.
- **Clue 3** states that the person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement. This means the carnations and the bouquet of lilies must be adjacent, and the person with the carnations must be to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies.
- **Clue 4** indicates that there is one house between where the flutist lives (house 2) and where the pianist lives. Therefore, the pianist must be in either house 3 or house 4.

Let's consider the possible positions for the pianist:

- If the pianist is in house 3, then the guitarist must be in house 2 (which is occupied by the flutist), and this contradicts the requirement that the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips must be adjacent and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips.
- Therefore, the pianist must be in house 4.

This leaves house 1 for the person with the bouquet of lilies and house 4 for the person with the carnations arrangement. The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 (since house 2 is occupied by the flutist and house 3 is occupied by the guitarist).

Thus, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.**
2. **The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.**
3. **The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.**

6. **The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.**
7. **The percussionist does not live in the second house.**

### Initial Setup

- **House 1:** The person who is eating kiwis.
- **House 2:** The person who likes green.
- **House 3:** The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy (they live next to each other).

### Clue 8
- The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
  - House 1: Eating kiwis.

### Clue 5
- The person who likes green lives in the first house.
  - House 1: Green (consistent with Clue 8).

### Clue 6
- The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
  - This means the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

### Clue 7
- The percussionist does not live in the second house.
  - This means the percussionist must live in either house 1 or house 3.

### Clue 3
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
  - This means the person who only drinks water must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

### Clue 2
- The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
  - This means the person who has a television must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

### Clue 1
- The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
  - This means the root beer lover must be to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

### Combining Clues

Given Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3.

### Final Arrangement

- **House 1:** Green (person who likes green)
- **House 2:** Blue (person who likes blue) and Gameboy (person who has a gameboy)
- **House 3:** Root beer (person who drinks root beer) and Kiwis (person who eats kiwis)

Since the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3, and the person who drinks root beer must be to the left of the person who drinks root beer, the only possible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** Green
- **House 2:** Blue, Gameboy
- **House 3:** Root beer, Kiwis

Thus, the cellist must live in house 3.

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
9. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
11. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
12. **Clue 9**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person in the third house is wearing high heels, the third house is house number 3.

Now, let's use Clue 11 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the root beer lover and the person who is eating mangos. Since the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be next to each other.

Given that the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the coffee drinker, and the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3 and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(C) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
   - This directly tells us that the grilled cheese eater lives in house number 5.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who had pizza lives in one of the houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the root beer lover and the person who had stew are neighbors, with the root beer lover being to the left of the person who had stew.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house number 5.

5. **Clue 5:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who ate spaghetti are neighbors, with the coffee drinker being to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in house number 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 5: Grilled cheese eater, person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 1: Person who had pizza (not in the first house)
- House 2: Person who had stew and the person who likes milk (must be neighbors)
- House 4: Person who only drinks water (not in the fifth house)

Since the person who only drinks water lives in house 5, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in houses 1 and 2. Given that the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors, they must be in houses 1 and 2.

Let's place the people:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with Clue 4.

Now, we need to place the root beer lover and the person who drinks coffee:
- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2, but since the person who had stew is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
- The coffee drinker must be in house 1 or 4, but house 4 is taken by the person who only drinks water, so the coffee drinker must be in house 1.

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with Clue 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Person who only drinks water (already placed)

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
2. **Clue 2:** The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

From Clue 1, the soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2. From Clue 4, the person with daffodils must be to the right of the person eating oranges. Therefore, the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person with daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 2, the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person with daffodils is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 1.

From Clue 3, the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos is in house 1, the person with tulips must be in house 3.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Person with daffodils
- House 3: Person with tulips

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. The violinist lives in House 1.
2. The history book buff lives in House 3.
3. The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 1.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.
5. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
6. The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone live directly next to each other.
7. The person who has a radio lives in either House 2 or House 3.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the percussionist.

From these, we can deduce:
- House 1: Violinist (ate spaghetti)
- House 3: History book buff (ate fried rice)
- House 2: Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone (next to each other)
- House 1: Person with a bouquet of daffodils (to the left of the percussionist)
- House 2: Person with a radio
- House 3: Person with a phone

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist and the violinist is in House 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1. This leaves House 2 for the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips must live in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. **Clue 5:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. **Clue 6:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the person who lives in the second house (Clue 2). This person is the mystery book reader.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: ?

Next, we use Clue 3 and Clue 6 to place the bird keeper and the fish enthusiast. The bird keeper cannot be in House 1 or House 3, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in House 3, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the history book buff. The history book buff must be directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the history book buff is in House 1, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 5 to place the percussionist. The percussionist must be directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the computer must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Next, we use Clue 7 to place the person who has a gameboy. The person who has a gameboy must be directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the gameboy is in House 2, the rose bouquet must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Finally, we use Clue 8 to place the cellist. The cellist cannot be in House 3. Since the cellist is not in House 3, the cellist must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the person who has a gameboy. The gameboy is in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy is directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the rose bouquet is in House 3, the gameboy must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. This means the person driving a truck must live in house 1 because the person driving a truck is the only other car type left.

From Clue 1, since the person driving a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff, and the person driving a truck is in house 1, the history book buff must be in house 2. Therefore, the person driving a convertible must be in house 1.

Now, let's assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person in house 1 (convertible driver) is not wearing boots, so they must be wearing sandals.
- The person in house 2 (truck driver) is not wearing boots, so they must be wearing boots.
- The person in house 1 (convertible driver) is not a history book buff, so they must be a mystery book reader.
- The person in house 2 (truck driver) is a history book buff.

Thus, the person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover.

From Clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

Now, let's use the other clues to determine the remaining houses:

- **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person wearing high heels must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.
- **Clue 4:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house. Therefore, the person wearing high heels must live in either the first or third house.
- **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers. This means the history book buff cannot live in the first house, and the person who is wearing loafers cannot live in the fourth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses.

Given these constraints, let's try to place the remaining people:

1. The third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.
2. The person wearing high heels cannot be in the second or fourth house, so they must be in the first or third house. Since the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
3. The person wearing high heels (first house) and the person wearing loafers (second house) must be to the right of each other. This means the person wearing loafers must be in the fourth house.
4. The person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses. Since the first and fourth houses are occupied, the only remaining houses are the second and third. The person wearing sandals must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person wearing high heels
- Second house: Person wearing sandals
- Third house: Mystery book reader
- Fourth house: Person wearing loafers

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- From Clue 2, we know the sequence of devices is: Gameboy → Computer.
- From Clue 1, we know the sequence of colors is: Green → Gameboy.
- From Clue 3, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors). This would place the person who has a gameboy in house 3. However, this contradicts Clue 2 because the person who has a gameboy (in house 3) cannot be directly left of the person who has a computer (which would be in house 2).
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors). This would place the person who has a gameboy in house 1. This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
  - The person who likes green (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 1).
  - The person who has a gameboy (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
  - The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
6. **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are in the same house, which contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, Clue 5 must be incorrect, and the root beer lover does not live in the third house. This means the root beer lover must live in one of the other houses.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. So, the tea drinker must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.

Let's summarize the information we have so far:
- The third house is occupied by the root beer lover.
- The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
- The tea drinker is not in the second house.

Let's place the people based on the clues:

1. The root beer lover is in the third house.
2. The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
3. The tea drinker is not in the second house.

If the tea drinker is in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house numbers step by step:

1. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (House 1).**
2. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house (House 1).** Therefore, the fish enthusiast must live in House 2.
3. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house (House 1).** Therefore, the person who had pizza must live in House 2.
4. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.** Since the fish enthusiast (who likes green) lives in House 2, the person who has a radio must live in House 1.

From these deductions:
- **House 1:** Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- **House 2:** Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who had pizza (in House 2) and the person who likes green (in House 2) are already determined, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in House 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in House 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in House 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in House 1 (since the fish enthusiast is in House 2).

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, pets, books, lunch, favorite colors, and drinks. Let's break down the clues and use them to narrow down the possibilities.

### Deductions

1. **Dog owner** lives in the second house.
2. **Stew** does not live in the third, fourth, or fifth house (from clue 18).
3. **Milk** and **blue** are directly left and right of each other. Since **dog owner** is in the second house, **milk** and **blue** cannot be in the first or second house. Therefore, **milk** must be in the first house and **blue** in the third house.
4. **Bird keeper** and **history book buff** are directly left and right of each other. Since **bird keeper** cannot be in the first house (from clue 3), and **history book buff** cannot be in the third house (from clue 3), **bird keeper** must be in the first house and **history book buff** in the second house.
5. **Spaghetti** lives somewhere to the left of **red**. Since **red** cannot be in the first or second house (from clue 5), **spaghetti** must be in the first house and **red** in the fourth house.
6. **Fried rice** lives somewhere to the left of **horses**. Since **horses** cannot be in the first or second house (from clue 6), **fried rice** must be in the first house and **horses** in the third house.
7. **Bird keeper** (first house) and **fish enthusiast** are one house apart. Since **fish enthusiast** cannot be in the first or second house (from clue 7), **fish enthusiast** must be in the third house.

10. **Coffee** lives somewhere to the right of the **dog owner**. Since **dog owner** is in the second house, **coffee** must be in the fifth house.
11. **Pizza** and **fantasy book enthusiast** live directly next to each other. Since **fantasy book enthusiast** cannot be in the first or second house (from clue 11), **fantasy book enthusiast** must be in the fourth house and **pizza** in the third house.
12. **Science fiction book fanatic** does not live in the second house. Since **science fiction book fanatic** cannot be in the first, second, or fifth house (from clue 12), **science fiction book fanatic** must be in the third house.
13. **Yellow** lives somewhere to the left of the **romance book lover**. Since **romance book lover** is in the second house, **yellow** must be in the first house.
14. **Tea** lives directly left of the **white**. Since **tea** is already in the first house, **white** must be in the second house.

### Final Arrangement

- **House 1**: Yellow, Tea, Stew
- **House 2**: White, Romance book lover, Root beer
- **House 3**: Science fiction book fanatic, Pizza, Fish enthusiast
- **House 4**: Fantasy book enthusiast, Horses, Spaghetti
- **House 5**: Coffee, Dog owner, Milk

From the final arrangement, we can see that the person who only drinks water lives in the **first house**.

Thus, the answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The flutist lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
9. **Clue 10:** The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
11. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
12. **Clue 13:** The cat lover lives in the first house.

From Clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, we can write:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 1, 3, or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 5, the flutist lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis.

From Clue 6, the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 7, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2 or 4.

From Clue 13, the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis, the cat lover must be the person eating kiwis, which contradicts Clue 13. Therefore, the cat lover must be in a different house.

Let's summarize the constraints:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis
- House 2: Person drinking water
- House 3: Person drinking milk
- House 4: Person drinking root beer

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2 or 4.

Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2. The person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who likes milk must live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 4.

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating mangos.

### Deductions:

   - Grilled cheese and stew must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.

5. **Grilled cheese and tulips are adjacent (Clue 8):**
   - Grilled cheese and tulips must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.

6. **Oranges and apples are adjacent (Clue 2):**
   - Oranges and apples must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.

7. **Oranges and kiwis are two houses apart (Clue 9):**
   - Oranges and kiwis must be in houses 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

8. **Oranges and carnations are adjacent (Clue 10):**
   - Oranges and carnations must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.

9. **Apples and mangos are adjacent (Clue 11):**
   - Apples and mangos must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.

### Final Arrangement:

Given the constraints, the only possible arrangement for grilled cheese and pizza, grilled cheese and tulips, grilled cheese and spaghetti, and grilled cheese and stew is in houses 1 and 2.

- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Tulips

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 4.

**The correct answer is (D) 4.**"
"Given the clues and logical deductions, we can determine the house where the fish enthusiast lives as follows:

1. The cat lover lives in house 1.
2. The person with tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, so the tulip owner must be in house 4 and the dog owner in house 5.
3. The person with daffodils does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 3 or house 4. Since the tulip owner is in house 4, the daffodils owner must be in house 3.
4. The person with lilies lives to the right of the person with horses. Since the horse owner must be in house 3 (as the daffodils owner is in house 3), the lilies owner must be in house 4 (which is already occupied by the tulip owner) or house 5. Since the dog owner is in house 5, the lilies owner must be in house 5.
5. The person with horses must be in house 3.

Thus, the house where the fish enthusiast lives is house 5.

The correct option is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their house numbers step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 has a phone.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 does not wear boots.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person with horses lives in house 1 and the person with a radio lives in house 2, or vice versa.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Has a phone.

From Clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Does not wear boots.

From Clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots and has a phone.

Since the person in house 1 has a phone (Clue 1), the person in house 2 must be wearing boots (since the person in house 2 does not wear boots). Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

Now, let's determine the pets and devices:
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots and has a phone.

Since the person in house 1 cannot have a phone (because the person in house 1 has a phone), the person in house 1 must own horses. The person in house 2 must have a radio.

So, the characteristics are:
- House 1: Owns horses, wears high heels, has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots, has a phone.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Grilled Cheese and Computer**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
2. **Grilled Cheese in Third House**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
3. **Apples in First House**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the first house.
4. **Apples and Boots**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the first house, and the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
5. **Blue and Phone**: There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives.
6. **Loafers and Computer**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house, and the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
7. **Pizza in Second House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.
8. **Mangos and Yellow**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
9. **Computer and Phone**: The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
10. **Grilled Cheese and Computer**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.

Let's start by placing the person who had pizza. Since they do not live in the second house (Clue 7), they must live in the first or third house.

Let's assume the person who had pizza lives in the first house. Then the person who has a computer must live in the second house (Clue 10). This leaves the third house for the person who ate grilled cheese.

Now, the person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house (Clue 2), so the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house. This leaves the second house for the person who has a computer.

Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house, the person who is eating apples must live in the third house (Clue 3). The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots (Clue 4), so the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house, and the person who is eating apples must live in the third house.

The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house, and the person who is eating apples lives in the third house. The person who likes blue must live in the first house (Clue 5), and the person who has a phone must live in the third house (Clue 5).

The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow (Clue 8). Since the person who likes yellow must live in the third house, the person who is eating mangos must live in the second house.

The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house (Clue 6), and the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other (Clue 1). Since the person who has a computer lives in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house.

Thus, the person who likes green must live in the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes green lives is **(A) 2**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

- From clue 3, the baseball player lives in the second house. So, the arrangement is:
  - House 1: ?
  - House 2: Baseball player
  - House 3: ?
  - House 4: ?

- From clue 1, the basketball player does not live in the first house. From clue 2, the basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the baseball player is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1. So, the arrangement is:
  - House 1: Basketball player
  - House 2: Baseball player
  - House 3: ?
  - House 4: ?

- From clue 2, the basketball player (House 1) lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the basketball player is in House 1, the swimmer must be in House 2 or House 3. But since the baseball player is already in House 2, the swimmer must be in House 3. So, the arrangement is:
  - House 1: Basketball player
  - House 2: Baseball player
  - House 3: Swimmer
  - House 4: ?

- From clue 6, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the baseball player is in House 2 and the swimmer is in House 3, the tennis player must be in House 3 and the cat lover must be in House 4. So, the arrangement is:
  - House 1: Basketball player
  - House 2: Baseball player
  - House 3: Swimmer
  - House 4: Cat lover

- From clue 5, the bird keeper does not live in the first house. From clue 7, the bird keeper does not live in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in House 1. So, the arrangement is:
  - House 1: Bird keeper
  - House 2: Baseball player
  - House 3: Swimmer
  - House 4: Cat lover

Thus, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **White and Computer**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
2. **Baseball Player and Blue**: There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. **Sedan and SUV**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. **Sedan and Gameboy**: The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
5. **Violinist and First House**: The violinist does not live in the first house.
6. **Guitarist and White**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
7. **Swimmer and SUV**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.

Let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

- **Clue 2**: The baseball player and the person who likes blue are separated by one house. This means the baseball player is in house 2 and the person who likes blue is in house 3.
- **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer. This means the computer owner cannot be in house 1, and the white lover cannot be in house 1.
- **Clue 3**: The sedan and SUV owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
- **Clue 4**: The sedan and gameboy owners must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
- **Clue 5**: The violinist does not live in the first house.
- **Clue 6**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white. This means the guitarist must be in house 3 or later.
- **Clue 7**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.

Given these clues, let's place the known elements:

- House 2: Baseball player
- House 3: Person who likes blue

Now, let's place the sedan and SUV:
- If the sedan is in house 1, the SUV must be in house 2 (but house 2 is already taken by the baseball player).
- Therefore, the sedan must be in house 2, and the SUV must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

Now, we need to place the violinist and the white lover:
- The violinist cannot be in house 1, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3.
- The white lover must be in house 1 or 3.

Since the white lover cannot be in house 1 (because the computer owner is there), the white lover must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 2 for the sedan owner.

Now, we need to place the guitarist and the gameboy:
- The guitarist must be to the right of the white lover (house 3), so the guitarist must be in house 3.
- The gameboy must be next to the sedan owner (house 2).

This leaves house 1 for the computer owner and house 3 for the person who likes blue.

### Final Arrangement

- House 1: Computer owner
- House 2: Sedan owner
- House 3: Person who likes blue

The remaining characteristics:
- The white lover is in house 3.
- The guitar is in house 3.
- The gameboy is in house 2.
- The violinist is in house 2.
- The baseball player is in house 2.
- The soccer player is in house 1.

Thus, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4, Clue 5, and Clue 11, we can deduce that the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1. The person who had fried rice must live in house number 2.

Now, let's place the cat lover in house number 3 (Clue 2).

Next, we need to place the person who owns horses and the person who has a gameboy.

"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step to determine the correct house where the person with a television lives.

1. **Pianist does not live in the first house.**
2. **Person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.**
3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other, and the person eating kiwis to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio next to each other, and the person eating oranges directly left of the person with a television.

- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, we need to place the person with a television directly right of the person eating oranges.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

All clues are satisfied with this arrangement. Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The answer is (A) 8."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses.

1. **The tea drinker does not live in the first house.**
2. **The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.**
3. **The person who likes red does not live in the third house.**
4. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.**
5. **The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.**
6. **There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.**
7. **The person who likes milk lives in the third house.**
8. **The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.**
9. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.**
10. **The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.**
11. **The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.**
12. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
13. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.**

From Clue 7, the person who likes milk lives in the third house. Let's denote this as:
- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives in the third house. This is a contradiction because the milk drinker is already in the third house. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the setup.

Let's assume the person who is eating apples lives in the second house:
- House 2: Apple eater

Now, the milk drinker must be in a different house. Let's try the fourth house:
- House 4: Milk drinker

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. So, the person who likes red must be in the first or fifth house.

From Clue 4, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the fifth house:
- House 5: Banana eater

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. The only possible positions for these are the first and second houses. Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the first house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the second house:
- House 1: Water drinker
- House 2: Yellow drinker

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. The only possible positions for these are the first and fifth houses. Since the water drinker is in the first house and the banana eater is in the fifth house, the root beer lover must be in the third house, and the person who is eating kiwis must be in the fourth house:
- House 3: Root beer lover
- House 4: Kiwi eater

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fifth house:
- House 5: SUV owner

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the water drinker is in the first house and the red drinker must be to the left of the water drinker, the red drinker must be in the second house:
- House 2: Red drinker

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the red drinker is in the second house, the convertible driver must be in the first house:
- House 1: Convertible driver

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the convertible driver is in the first house and the blue drinker must be to the left of the truck driver, the blue drinker must be in the second house, and the truck driver must be in the third house:
- House 2: Blue drinker
- House 3: Truck driver

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the blue drinker is in the second house and the mangos eater must be to the left of the green drinker, the mangos eater must be in the first house, and the green drinker must be in the third house:
- House 1: Mangos eater
- House 3: Green drinker

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the yellow drinker is in the second house and the sedan owner must be to the right of the yellow drinker, the sedan owner must be in the third house:
- House 3: Sedan owner

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.
5. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The person eating a banana does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person eating a banana must live in the third house.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.
- The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
- Therefore, the person who drives a truck must live in the second house.

This leaves the first house for the person who owns an SUV.

Thus, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
4. The cricketer does not live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.

From clue 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second house, as they live directly left of the fried rice eater.

From clue 3, the swimmer lives in the first house.

From clue 4, the cricketer cannot be in the third house, which is consistent with the fried rice eater being there.

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 6:** The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.

   - Possible positions for boots and truck: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

7. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.
   - Possible positions for truck: (1, 2), (3, 5)

8. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - Possible positions for truck and sandals: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

9. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.
   - Possible positions for loafers and minivan: (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)

10. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
    - Possible positions for loafers and truck: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

11. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.
    - Possible positions for SUV: (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

### Deductions

- House 5: Blue
- House 4: White
- House 1: SUV (since it cannot be in the first house)
- House 2: Running shoes (since it cannot be in the first house and there are two houses between sedan and running shoes)
- House 3: Green (since it cannot be in the first house and there is one house between green and truck)

Now, we need to place the remaining elements:

- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue

Next, we need to place the truck and sandals:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Since the truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in a house to the right of the truck, we can place:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Finally, we need to place the truck and sandals:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Since the truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in a house to the right of the truck, we can place:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

### Conclusion

The person who is wearing boots must live somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck. Given the constraints, the only possible position for boots is in House 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is **(A) 1**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the history book buff:

1. The history book buff lives in the first house.
2. There is one house between where the person who had stew lives and where the history book buff lives. Since the history book buff is in the first house, the person who had stew must be in either the second or the third house.
3. There is one house between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who had stew lives. This means the person who had pizza must be in the house that is one house away from the person who had stew.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From clue 1, the history book buff is in house 1. From clue 2, the person who had stew cannot be in house 2 (since the fantasy book enthusiast is there), so the person who had stew must be in house 3. From clue 3, the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

Thus, the history book buff lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is:
(B) 1"

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - This directly tells us the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 1.

2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who owns a sedan can live in houses 1, 2, 4, or 5.

3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means the minivan driver and the high heels wearer must be adjacent to each other.

4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the sandals wearer and the convertible driver must be adjacent to each other.

5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.
   - This means the running shoes wearer and the boots wearer must be adjacent to each other.

6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 4.

Given Clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

Given Clue 6, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

Given Clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other. Since the running shoes wearer is in house 1, the boots wearer must be in house 2.

Given Clue 4, the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the running shoes wearer is in house 1 and the boots wearer is in house 2, the sandals wearer must be in house 3, and the convertible driver must be in house 5.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The cricketer lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.
3. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Cricketer

From clue 3, the horse owner and sedan owner must be in adjacent houses. Let's denote the sedan owner as ""S"" and the horse owner as ""H"". This means H and S cannot be in houses 1 and 2, and they must be in houses 2 and 3.

From clue 2, the cat lover must be in a house adjacent to the sedan owner. Since H and S are adjacent, the cat lover (C) must be in a house adjacent to either H or S. Given the arrangement of H and S, C must be in house 2 or 3.

From clue 4, the truck driver (T) lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (B). This means B and T cannot be in adjacent houses.

Let's place the people step by step:

- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: (S, C, H)
- House 3: (S, C, H)

Since H and S must be adjacent and C must be adjacent to either H or S, let's try placing H and S in houses 2 and 3:

- House 2: Horse owner (H)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)

This leaves the cat lover (C) to be in house 2 or 3. Since C must be adjacent to S or H, and H is already in house 2, C must be in house 3.

So the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Cat lover (C)
- House 3: Sedan owner (S)

Since the truck driver (T) lives in house 3, the basketball player (B) must live in house 2.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

   - The person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible, house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, and house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV). The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 4. Since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, the bird keeper must be in house 4.

7. **Clue 8**: The bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The bird keeper is in house 4, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. But house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to recheck the placement.

From Clue 4, the person eating apples cannot live in the third house, so they must live in either the first or the fourth house. But since the fourth house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the person eating apples must live in the first house.

From Clue 5, the person eating mangos lives directly left of the person wearing sandals. Since the first house is occupied by the person eating mangos, the person wearing sandals must live in the second house.

From Clue 3, the person eating apples (in the first house) lives directly left of the person wearing sandals (in the second house).

From Clue 6, there is one house between where the person eating apples (in the first house) lives and where the person wearing boots (in the fourth house) lives. This confirms the arrangement.

From Clue 8, the person eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast (in the third house). Since the third house is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast, the person eating a banana must live in the fourth house, but since the fourth house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic, the person eating a banana must live in the fifth house.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the characteristics of each person and their house numbers.

### Clue Analysis

1. **Fried Rice and Spaghetti**:
   - The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house (number 1).
   - Therefore, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house (number 2).

2. **SUV and Car**:
   - The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house (number 2).
   - Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house (number 1).

3. **Flutist and White**:
   - The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - Since the flutist lives in the first house (number 1), the person who likes white must live in the second house (number 2).

4. **Loafers and White**:
   - The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - Since the person who likes white lives in the second house (number 2), the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house (number 1).

### Summary of Characteristics

- **First House (Number 1)**:
  - Flutist
  - Wearing loafers
  - Owns an SUV

- **Second House (Number 2)**:
  - Person who likes white
  - Wearing sandals
  - Owns an SUV

### Conclusion

The person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house (number 2).

Thus, the correct answer is **(B) 2**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. **Clue 6:** The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist.

From Clue 4, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house (house 3).

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house (Clue 3), the person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who drives a minivan must live in house 1.

From Clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the sedan owner cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), the sedan owner must be in house 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3. But house 3 is occupied by the root beer lover, so the sedan owner must be in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the person who is eating apples must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, so this is a contradiction. Let's recheck the sedan owner and the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 6, the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. This means the cellist and saxophonist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the cellist must be in house 1, and the saxophonist must be in house 2.

From Clue 9, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who is eating apples is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

From Clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover

The violinist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct house for the person wearing loafers:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Yellow

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person wearing boots cannot be in house 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person with a phone must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the person with a television and the person who ate fried rice must be in adjacent houses, but the television must be to the left of the fried rice.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not white

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the person wearing sandals and the person with a gameboy must be in adjacent houses, but the sandals must be to the left of the gameboy.

7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4 or 4 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 2 and 4).

8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not stew

9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the cat lover must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Grilled cheese

11. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.
    - This means the cat lover and the dog owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (but since the cat lover is already in house 4 or 5, the dog owner must be in house 1 or 2).

12. **Clue 12:** The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
    - House 2: High heels

13. **Clue 13:** The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Not red

14. **Clue 14:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - This means the person with a gameboy and the person wearing loafers must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

15. **Clue 15:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
    - This means the fish enthusiast and the person with a radio must be in adjacent houses, but the fish enthusiast must be to the left of the radio.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television.
    - This means the person who owns horses and the person with a television must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (but since the person with a television is already in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 1).

17. **Clue 17:** The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.
    - House 4: Blue

18. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
    - House 3: Not boots

19. **Clue 19:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
    - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes white must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Not boots, not yellow, not stew
- House 4: Blue, loafers, not white
- House 5: Grilled cheese, not red, not stew
- House 6: Not white, not red, not stew

Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 5 (since the loafers must be to the right of the cat lover, and the cat lover must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is already occupied by high heels).

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

The answer is (E) 5."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the person in the first house (house 1) has a television. Consequently, the person in the second house (house 2) must have the computer.

From clue 1, the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house, so they must live in the second house (house 2).

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic (SFF) lives somewhere to the left of the golfer (Golfer).
   - This means SFF and Golfer cannot be in the same house, and Golfer must be to the right of SFF.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) live directly next to each other.
   - This means PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist (G) lives somewhere to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils (D).
   - This means G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D.

Let's denote the houses as House 1 and House 2, and the people as Person 1 (in House 1) and Person 2 (in House 2).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Clue 1 Analysis:**
  - SFF and Golfer must be in different houses, and Golfer must be to the right of SFF.
  - Possible positions: Golfer in House 2, SFF in House 1.

- **Clue 2 Analysis:**
  - PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses.
  - Possible positions: PE in House 1, HBB in House 2 or PE in House 2, HBB in House 1.

- **Clue 3 Analysis:**
  - G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D.
  - Possible positions: G in House 2, D in House 1 or G in House 1, D in House 2.

### Combining Clues:

- From Clue 1, Golfer is in House 2 and SFF is in House 1.
- From Clue 2, PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses. Since Golfer is in House 2, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.
- From Clue 3, G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D. Since Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 2 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.

From Clue 3, we know that the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. Let's denote the houses as follows:
- House 1: Lilies
- House 2: Unknown

From Clue 4, the basketball player cannot live in house 1. Therefore, the basketball player must live in house 2.

Now, let's consider Clue 1 and Clue 2 together. Since the person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist, the person eating apples must be to the left of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must live in house 1, and the violinist must live in house 2.

To summarize:
- House 1: Lilies (person with the bouquet of lilies)
- House 2: Unknown (person eating apples, violinist, or basketball player)

Since the basketball player cannot be in house 1, and the violinist must be in house 2, the violinist must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

Let's deduce step by step:

- Tennis player (3rd house)
- Grilled cheese (5th house)
- Golfer (4th house)
- Stew (1st house) and Spaghetti (3rd house) (since there is one house between them, and the 3rd house is already occupied by the tennis player)
- Pizza (2nd house) and Cricketer (2nd house) (since the pizza eater is to the left of the cricketer, and the 2nd house is left of the 3rd house)
- Soccer player (1st house) (since the soccer player must be to the left of the tennis player, and the 1st house is left of the 3rd house)

Thus, the cricketer lives in the 2nd house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house (house 2).
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1.

From these clues, we can summarize the characteristics of each house:
- **House 1:** Person who only drinks water, Person who likes white, Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2)
- **House 2:** Person who only drinks water (lives in house 1), Person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2), Person who likes red, Person who plays baseball (lives in house 1), Person who wears loafers (lives in house 2)

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

The correct answer is **(A) 2**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as A, B, and C, corresponding to the houses 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

- **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the person eating oranges must live in either house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. If the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
- **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means if the coffee drinker is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 3. If the coffee drinker is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 3).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 2).

This configuration does not work because the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2.

- If the root beer lover is in house 3:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Given that the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

- Since the water drinker and milk drinker are in houses 1 and 2, the coffee drinker and rose bouquet must be in house 2.
- The person with daffodils and the person with lilies are one house apart, so the person with lilies must be in house 3.
- The person with horses and the person with lilies are one house apart, so the person with horses must be in house 4.

- The person with running shoes is in house 2, so the person with running shoes and the person with loafers must be in houses 1 and 2, but since the person with running shoes is in house 2, the person with loafers must be in house 1.
- The person with running shoes is in house 2, so the person with running shoes and the person with loafers must be in houses 1 and 2, but since the person with running shoes is in house 2, the person with loafers must be in house 1.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their house numbers step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating kiwis
   - House 2: Eating apples

2. **Clue 4:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

3. **Clue 5:** The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not dog owner
   - House 2: Dog owner

From Clue 5, we know the dog owner lives in House 2. Therefore, the person in House 1 is not the dog owner.

4. **Clue 2:** The bird keeper and the person who is wearing high heels live directly next to each other.
   - House 1: Bird keeper or high heels
   - House 2: High heels or bird keeper

Since the person in House 1 is not the dog owner, the bird keeper must be in House 1 and the person wearing high heels must be in House 2.

5. **Clue 3:** The tennis player and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
   - House 1: Tennis player or eating apples
   - House 2: Tennis player or eating apples

Since the person in House 1 is the bird keeper and the person in House 2 is the dog owner, the tennis player must be in House 1 and the person eating apples must be in House 2.

6. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Bird keeper, eating kiwis
   - House 2: Dog owner, eating apples

Now we have:
- House 1: Bird keeper, eating kiwis
- House 2: Dog owner, eating apples

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is the bird keeper and eating kiwis.
- The person in House 2 is the dog owner and eating apples.
- The tennis player and the person eating apples live next to each other in House 1, so the tennis player must be in House 1.
- The person in House 2 is the dog owner and eating apples.
- The person in House 1 is the bird keeper and eating kiwis.
- The person in House 2 is the dog owner and eating apples.
- The person in House 1 is the tennis player and the person in House 2 is the cricketer.

Therefore, the cricketer must live in House 2.

The number of the house where the cricketer lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."

From the above analysis, we can conclude that the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
   - This implies the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person eating grapes must also live in the second house, which is consistent with Clue 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - Since the person eating grapes lives in the second house, the person driving a convertible must also live in the second house.

From these deductions:
- The person eating grapes lives in the second house.
- The person driving a convertible lives in the second house.
- The person eating mangos must live in the first house (since the person eating grapes lives in the second house and the person driving a convertible lives in the second house).

Therefore, the person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes blue is in house number 2.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 3. But since the person who likes blue is to the left of the person who is eating kiwis, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person who is eating apples is in house 1 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3. But we already know the person who likes blue is in house 2, so the person who is eating oranges must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since the person who likes blue is in house 2 and the person who likes white must be in house 3).
   - Therefore, the person who likes white must be in house 3.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 3 (but there is no house 3, so this is not possible).

2. **The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the soccer player and the mystery book reader must be in adjacent houses, with the soccer player in house 1 and the mystery book reader in house 2, or vice versa.

3. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the person with the gameboy must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person with the gameboy is in house 1.
- The mystery book reader is in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player is in house 1 (since the mystery book reader is in house 2).

From clue 1, we know:
- The root beer lover must be in house 2 (since the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the root beer lover is to the right of the person with the rose bouquet).

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, Gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Root beer, Rose bouquet

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the people as Cat Lover, Fish Enthusiast, Horse Owner, and Dog Owner.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**From Clue 4:**
- The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
- This means the fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 2:**
- There are two houses between the truck and the dog owner.
- This means the truck and the dog owner cannot be in the first or last house. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

**From Clue 3:**
- The truck lives directly left of the sedan.
- This means the truck and the sedan must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 1:**
- The minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
- This means the minivan cannot be in the first house.

**From Clue 5:**
- The cat lover does not live in the second house.
- This means the cat lover must live in either the first or the fourth house.

### Combining Clues:

Let's test the possible positions for the dog owner and the truck:

1. **Dog owner in house 3:**
   - Truck must be in house 2 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 4 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 2 and the dog owner is in house 3).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration works:
   - House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
   - House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
   - House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
   - House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

2. **Dog owner in house 4:**
   - Truck must be in house 3 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 2 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 3 and the dog owner is in house 4).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 5).

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:
- House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
- House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
- House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

   - This means the person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water.

3. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3.

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3.

Given these constraints, let's place the people in the houses:
- House 1: Only drinks water (let's call this person ""W"")
- House 2: Likes root beer (let's call this person ""R"")
- House 3: Likes yellow (let's call this person ""Y"")
- House 4: Likes blue (let's call this person ""B"")

Since the person who likes blue (B) must be in a house number greater than 3, and the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3, the only possible house for the person who likes blue is House 4.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue step by step:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house (house 2).
2. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
3. **Clue 2**: The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
4. **Clue 4**: The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
5. **Clue 5**: The person wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
6. **Clue 7**: The person wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

Given Clue 6, we know:
- House 2: Person who likes blue.

Given Clue 1, the cricketer must be in house 3 (since house 2 is taken by the person who likes blue).

Given Clue 5, the person wearing sandals must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer).

Given Clue 4, the dog owner must be in house 1 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer and the person wearing sandals).

Given Clue 2, the baseball player must be in house 1 (since house 1 is taken by the dog owner).

Given Clue 3, the person eating grapes must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer, person wearing sandals, and person eating grapes).

Given Clue 7, the person wearing loafers must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer, person wearing sandals, and person eating grapes).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Dog owner, Baseball player
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricketer, Person wearing sandals, Person eating grapes, Person wearing loafers

The person who likes white (the only color left) must be the bird keeper, and since the bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (as house 1 is taken by the dog owner and baseball player), the bird keeper must be in house 3.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Since the cellist and the person with the gameboy are neighbors and the cellist is to the left of the person with the gameboy, they must occupy adjacent houses.
- The dog owner cannot be in house 1, so the dog owner must be in house 2.

Considering the possible arrangements:
- If the cellist is in house 1, the person with the gameboy must be in house 2.
- If the cellist is in house 2, the person with the gameboy must be in house 1.

However, the dog owner cannot be in house 1, so the only valid arrangement is:
- Cellist in house 1
- Gameboy owner in house 2

This leaves house 1 for the dog owner.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is (A) 1."

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Radio and Truck**: The person with the radio and the person driving the truck live next to each other.
2. **Radio and Pizza**: The person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.
3. **Root Beer Lover**: The root beer lover does not live in the first house (house 1).
4. **Grapes and Computer**: The person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with the computer.

Given these clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person:

- Since the root beer lover does not live in house 1, they must live in house 2.
- The person eating grapes must live directly left of the person with the computer, so the computer must be in house 1 and the grapes in house 2.
- The person with the radio must live to the left of the person who had pizza, and they must live next to each other.

From the above deductions:
- The person eating grapes is in house 2.
- The person with the computer is in house 1.
- The person with the radio is in house 1 (since they must be next to the person with the pizza and the pizza person must be in house 1).

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is **1**.

**Correct option: (B) 1**"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the milk drinker and the spaghetti eater cannot be in adjacent houses.

3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the yellow liker cannot be in adjacent houses.

4. The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means the white liker and the water drinker must be in adjacent houses.

5. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the tea drinker (House 1) and the pizza eater (House 2) are adjacent.

6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the spaghetti eater and the water drinker cannot be in adjacent houses.

7. The person who likes green does not live in the first house.
   - The green liker cannot be in House 1.

8. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.
   - The grilled cheese eater cannot be in House 1.

Given these constraints, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza eater (adjacent to the tea drinker)
- House 3: Spaghetti eater (adjacent to the water drinker)
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater (adjacent to the pizza eater)

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- The green liker cannot be in House 1.
- The green liker cannot be in House 4 (since the grilled cheese eater is there).
- The green liker cannot be in House 2 (since the pizza eater is there).
- The green liker must be in House 3.

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

### Conclusion:
The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in **House 1**.

Thus, the answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The soccer player lives in the third house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.

Given these clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

- Since the soccer player lives in house number 3, the possible houses for the golfer and the basketball player are houses 1 and 2.
- From Clue 1, the golfer and the basketball player are adjacent, so they must be in houses 1 and 2.
- From Clue 2, the person with lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese are adjacent, and the person with lilies is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person with lilies must be in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person with lilies
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player

Now, we need to place the basketball player and the person who ate spaghetti. The basketball player must be in house 1 or 2, but since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2, the basketball player must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the person who ate spaghetti.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with lilies
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. **Clue 8:** There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
8. **Clue 10:** The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 11:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
10. **Clue 12:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 2 and Clue 7, we know:
- The third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.
- The fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 5, the person who likes green cannot be in the fourth house, so the fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house. This contradicts Clue 7, so we need to reassess. Since Clue 7 is correct, the third house is occupied by the person who likes red.

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- The first house is occupied by the person who likes blue.
- The second house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.
- The fifth house is occupied by the person who likes white.

From Clue 4, the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Therefore, the second house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, and the first house is occupied by the person who had stew.

From Clue 8, there are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives. Since the second house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes white.

From Clue 10, the percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes white, the fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti, and the third house is occupied by the person who likes red, the percussionist and the cellist must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. Given the constraints, the percussionist must be in the first house and the cellist in the second house.

From Clue 6, the pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. Since the percussionist is in the first house, the pianist must be in the second house, which is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 12, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the second house, the person who had pizza must be in the fifth house, which is occupied by the person who likes white.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

From Clue 2, the person who had stew must be in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese. This means the person who only drinks water cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew. This means the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in house 4.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. This means they must be in adjacent houses.

Let's place the people step by step:

- House 3: Tea drinker (Clue 1)
- House 2: Grilled cheese (Clue 7)
- House 4: Only drinks water (Clue 4, since it must be to the right of the grilled cheese eater)
- House 1: Stew (Clue 2, since it must be to the left of the spaghetti eater)
- House 4: Running shoes (Clue 5, since it must be to the left of the stew eater)

- Ninth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Ninth house: person who had stew
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the tenth house)
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese
- Eleventh house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives in the ninth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the eleventh house)
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From the above analysis, the person with the computer lives directly left of the person with the gameboy. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with the radio lives in the third house, and the person with the loafers lives in the third house, the person with the gameboy must be in the second house, and the person with the computer must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).
   - Since the person who ate fried rice is in house 2, the person who ate pizza must be in house 1.
   - Therefore, the person who ate pizza is the science fiction book fanatic.

From these deductions, it is clear that the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is **(B) 1**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their house number step by step:

1. **The pianist lives in the first house.**
   - This means the pianist lives in house 1.

2. **The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.**
   - This implies the root beer lover lives in house 2, and the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

3. **The person who likes white does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person who likes white lives in house 1.

From these clues, we can conclude:
- The pianist lives in house 1.
- The person who owns horses lives in house 1 (since the person who likes white also lives in house 1, and the root beer lover lives in house 2).
- The person who likes white lives in house 1.
- The root beer lover lives in house 2.

Since the person who owns horses is the dog owner, the dog owner lives in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

3. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fried rice eater and fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 3.

4. **Clue 4**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

5. **Clue 1**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

6. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

7. **Clue 3**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

Given the constraints:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater
- The guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.
- The guitarist and violinist must be in houses 1 and 3.

This leaves:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist

Now, the remaining houses (1 and 3 are taken) must be:
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

The only remaining positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."

   - House 2: Not wearing boots

3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not a bird keeper

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils

5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Likes green (since it's directly left of the person wearing running shoes)

6. **Clue 6:** The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - House 3: Owns horses
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 1: Likes white

   - House 1: Likes white
   - House 2: Has daffodils
   - House 3: Owns horses

From Clue 7, we know that the person who owns horses lives in House 3 and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in House 2.

From Clue 5, the person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who owns horses (House 3) and the person who has daffodils (House 2) are next to each other, the person who likes green must be in House 1, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3. However, since the person who owns horses is already in House 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Likes white, Wearing sandals
- House 2: Has daffodils, Wearing running shoes
- House 3: Owns horses, Wearing boots

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. **Clue 3:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement looks like this:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
3. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
7. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 3.

From Clue 7, we know:
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in house 2 and the person who likes red is in house 1, this is consistent.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: History book buff (Clue 6)

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the person who only drinks water lives in house number 1. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as A, B, and C.

From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house number 2. So, we have:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies

From Clue 1, there is one house between the person who only drinks water (house 1) and the person who likes milk. This means the person who likes milk must be in house 3. So, we have:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies
- House 3: Person who likes milk

From Clue 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies (in house 2) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 or house 3. But house 1 is already occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who has a rose bouquet
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies
- House 3: Person who likes milk

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To determine the house where the cricketer lives, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
2. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
4. The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
6. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
8. The tennis player lives in the third house.
9. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
10. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
11. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. From clue 1, the person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house. From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. From clue 8, the tennis player lives in the third house. From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. From clue 6, the person who has a phone does not live in the second house. From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. From clue 11, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.

Let's summarize the information:
- House 1: Person who likes green, person who is wearing loafers, person who has a radio.
- House 2: Person who likes blue, person who has a phone.
- House 3: Person who likes yellow, person who has a gameboy.
- House 4: Person who likes white, person who is wearing sandals, person who has a television.

From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who likes green lives in house 1, the person who has a radio must live in house 2. Therefore, the person who has a phone lives in house 1.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a phone lives in house 1, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 2 or 3. But since the person who likes blue lives in house 3, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 3.

From clue 8, the tennis player lives in house 3. Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in house 3.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing sandals must live in house 4, the cricketer must live in house 3.

However, we have a contradiction because the person who likes blue lives in house 3, and the person who has a gameboy also lives in house 3. This means we need to recheck the placement of the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy.

Since the person who likes blue lives in house 3, the person who has a gameboy must live in house 4. This means the cricketer must live in house 2.

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in House 1.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and since the romance book lover is to the left of the history book buff, the only possible arrangement for these two is:
- Romance book lover in House 2
- History book buff in House 3

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in House 1, so they must live in either House 2 or House 3. Since the romance book lover is in House 2, the person who had pizza must be in House 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes green must be to the left of the history book buff. Since the history book buff is in House 3, the person who likes green must be in House 2. This is consistent with the arrangement we have.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

Let's start by placing the tennis player and the television based on Clue 1. The tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be to the left of the television. So, the possible pairs are:
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 3
- Tennis player in house 2, television in house 3

### Case 1: Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Television (V) in house 2

Now, the golfer cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3. But since the tennis player is already in house 1, the golfer must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Golfer (G) in house 3

This leaves house 2 for the computer and house 3 for the radio and rose bouquet. Since the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses (Clue 3), and the radio and rose bouquet must be in adjacent houses (Clue 4 and Clue 5), we need to place the computer and tulips in house 2 and the radio and rose bouquet in house 3.

### Checking the placement:
- House 1: Tennis player (T)
- House 2: Computer (C) and Tulips (Tul)
- House 3: Radio (R) and Rose bouquet (Rb)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. Tennis player (T) is to the left of the television (V) in house 1 and house 2.
2. Golfer (G) is in house 3.
3. Computer (C) and tulips (Tul) are in adjacent houses (house 2).
4. Radio (R) and rose bouquet (Rb) are in adjacent houses (house 3).
5. Radio (R) is to the right of the television (V) in house 3.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct house for the person wearing sandals.

1. **Clue 1:** The swimmer lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Swimmer

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 5, and the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the tulips person is in house X+1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means if the running shoes person is in house X, the daffodils person is in house X+1.

5. **Clue 5:** The violinist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Violinist

6. **Clue 6:** The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means if the basketball player is in house X, the guitarist is in house X+1.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the high heels person is in house X, the lilies person is in house X+1.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - This means if the loafers person is in house X, the percussionist is in house X+1.

9. **Clue 9:** The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Cricketer

10. **Clue 10:** The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
    - This means they must be in houses X and X+1.

11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

12. **Clue 12:** There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.
    - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the cellist must be in house X+3 or X-3 (but since houses are numbered 1 to 5, X-3 is not possible).

### Deductions:
- **House 1:** Not possible for violinist, cricketer, or cellist.
- **House 2:** Violinist.
- **House 3:** Swimmer.
- **House 4:** Cricketer.
- **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils.

Given Clue 11, the daffodils person is in house 5. Clue 12 tells us that the sandals person must be in house 1.

### Final Check:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

The person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the fish enthusiast lives in house 1, and the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
   - This confirms that the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce:
- The person in house 1 is the fish enthusiast.
- The person in house 2 is wearing high heels and ate grilled cheese.

Since the fish enthusiast (in house 1) cannot be the dog owner (as the dog owner must be in house 2), and the person in house 2 (wearing high heels) cannot be the fish enthusiast, the person in house 1 must be the dog owner, and the person in house 2 must be the fish enthusiast (wearing high heels and ate grilled cheese).

This leaves the person in house 1 to have had stew (the only remaining option).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

   - House 5: Romance book lover.

3. **Clue 7:** The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Fish enthusiast.

4. **Clue 12:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
   - This means the person who likes blue and the mystery book reader are adjacent, and the person who likes blue is to the left of the mystery book reader.

5. **Clue 1:** The person who likes blue and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who likes blue and the history book buff are adjacent, and the person who likes blue is to the left of the history book buff.

6. **Clue 6:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the dog owner are adjacent, and the fantasy book enthusiast is to the left of the dog owner.

7. **Clue 11:** The person who likes red and the romance book lover live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who likes red and the romance book lover are adjacent, and the person who likes red is to the left of the romance book lover.

8. **Clue 4:** The person who likes white and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns horses are adjacent, and the person who likes white is to the left of the person who owns horses.

9. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the person who likes yellow is to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

10. **Clue 9:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.
    - This means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who likes yellow are adjacent, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the person who likes yellow.

11. **Clue 8:** There is one house between where the person who has a vase of tulips lives and where the romance book lover lives.
    - The romance book lover is in the fifth house, so the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the fourth or sixth house. Since the sixth house is not occupied, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the remaining elements:

- House 1: Person who likes yellow (since they are to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies).
- House 2: Person who owns horses.
- House 3: Fish enthusiast.
- House 4: Person who has a vase of tulips.
- House 5: Romance book lover.
- House 6: Person who likes red (since they are next to the person who likes blue, and the person who likes blue is next to the history book buff).

From the above, we can deduce:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow.
- House 2: Person who owns horses.
- House 3: Fish enthusiast.
- House 4: Person who has a vase of tulips.
- House 5: Romance book lover.
- House 6: Person who likes red.

Since the person who likes yellow is in the 1st house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the 3rd house (since they are next to the person who likes yellow).

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in the 1st house.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is **1**.

3. **Clue 3:** The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
4. **Clue 4:** The flutist lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.

14. **Clue 14:** The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
15. **Clue 15:** The science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From Clue 2, we know the person with a phone lives in the third house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

From Clue 4, the flutist lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the flutist.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing running shoes also lives in the third house. This contradicts Clue 2, so we need to re-evaluate. Since Clue 2 states the phone lives in the third house, and Clue 6 states the running shoes live in the third house, we need to consider the possibility that the phone and running shoes are different people.

From Clue 1, the person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other. Let's denote the person eating grapes as G and the person eating oranges as O. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From Clue 5, the person eating oranges (O) lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots (B). From Clue 3, the saxophonist (S) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots (B). This means B must be to the right of S.

From Clue 7, the romance book lover (R) lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic (SF). This means R and SF must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels (HH) lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast (FB) lives. This means HH and FB must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 5 (but since we only have 4 houses, it must be 1 and 4).

From Clue 12, the history book buff (HB) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges (O). This means HB must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 13, the person eating kiwis (K) does not live in the first house. So K must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 14, the percussionist (P) lives in the fourth house. So P is in house 4.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic (SF) and the person who is wearing running shoes (RS) live directly next to each other. Since RS lives in the third house, SF must live in the second house.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: HB (History book buff)
- House 2: SF (Science fiction book fanatic)
- House 3: RS (Running shoes)
- House 4: P (Percussionist)

Since the person eating oranges (O) must be to the right of the person wearing boots (B) and B must be to the right of S, and O must be to the right of B, the only possible positions for O and B are:
- O in house 4 (since P is in house 4)
- B in house 3 (since RS is in house 3)

This leaves the person eating grapes (G) and the person wearing boots (B) in houses 1 and 2. Since HB is in house 1, B must be in house 2, and G must be in house 1.

So, the person eating oranges lives in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

### Deductions

From Clue 7, the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the saxophonist.

### Clue 6
The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

### Clue 4
The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

### Clue 1
The romance book lover (in the second house) lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

### Clue 2
There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the guitarist must be in the third house, and the history book buff must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is occupied by the romance book lover. This means the history book buff must be in the first house.

### Clue 3
There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the saxophonist must be in the fourth house. This is consistent with Clue 4.

### Final Positions
- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Romance book lover
- **House 3:** Saxophonist
- **House 4:** Mystery book reader
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast

### Conclusion
The violinist must be in the third house, as the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.

Thus, the number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

Let's deduce step by step:

- From Clue 1, the fourth house has a television.
- From Clue 2, the second house has loafers.
- From Clue 3, the second house does not have a phone, so the person with the phone must be in the first, third, or fourth house. Since the fourth house already has a television, the phone must be in the first or third house.
- From Clue 4, the boots must be in a house to the left of the loafers. Since the loafers are in the second house, the boots must be in the first house.
- From Clue 5, there are two houses between the radio and the sandals. Given the positions of the other items, the radio must be in the first house and the sandals in the third house.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: Television

The person with the gameboy must be in the remaining house, which is the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a gameboy lives is **3**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
   - This directly places the person wearing high heels in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Since the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 2, and we know the high heels person lives in house number 2, the coffee drinker must live in either house number 1 or house number 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes milk must live in either house number 2 or house number 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
   - This is consistent with Clue 2, as the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 3.

Since the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 3, the person who likes milk must be in house number 2 (because the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 2, and the person who likes milk cannot be in house number 1).

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house number 2, and the coffee drinker must live in house number 1.

Thus, the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - This implies the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
   - Since the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, the mystery book reader cannot live in the second house. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

From this, we can deduce:
- The person wearing loafers lives in the second house.
- The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

The remaining characteristics (history book buff and high heels) must be assigned to the remaining person, which means:
- The history book buff must live in the second house.
- The person wearing high heels must live in the first house.

Thus, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and deduce the correct placement of each person and their belongings.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a gameboy (G) live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (P) lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a vase of tulips (T) lives directly left of the person who had pizza (P).
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a carnations arrangement (C) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) lives directly left of the person who had stew (St).
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a television (Tv) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a rose bouquet (Rb) live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing boots (B) lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza (P).
10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate spaghetti (Sp) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).

Let's start by placing the person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S) based on Clue 2 and Clue 9:

- Clue 2: P lives directly left of S.
- Clue 9: B lives somewhere to the left of P.

Let's try different placements:

- If P is in house 1, then S must be in house 2 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 2, then B must be in house 1 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P. So, let's try another arrangement:

- If P is in house 2, then S must be in house 3 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 3, then B must be in house 2 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is also not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P.

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is possible. Let's check the other clues with this arrangement:

- **Clue 1:** R and G live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 4:** T lives directly left of P.
- **Clue 5:** C lives somewhere to the left of S.
- **Clue 6:** R lives directly left of St.
- **Clue 7:** Tv lives directly left of Rd.
- **Clue 8:** R and Rb live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 10:** Sp lives directly left of Rd.

Let's place the remaining items:

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4.
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (Clue 9).
- If R is in house 2, then G must be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- If T is in house 1, then C must be in house 2 (Clue 4).
- If R is in house 2, then St must be in house 3 (Clue 6).
- If Rb is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 8).
- If Sp is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 10).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person with the rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2, or the lilies are in house 1 and the rose bouquet is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - This means the person eating mangos lives in house 1.

From Clue 1, we know the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2. This matches our deductions from Clue 3 and Clue 2.

Therefore, the person eating apples must live in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is **(B) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 15**: The person who has a radio lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house (House 4).
3. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in House 4, the person with a television must be in House 5.
4. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given Clue 15, the person with a radio is in House 1, and the person with a computer cannot be in House 3 (Clue 9), so the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in Houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since the coffee drinker is in House 4, the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in Houses 2 and 3.
5. **Clue 14**: The basketball player lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the basketball player and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given the possible placements, the only valid pair is (2, 3).
6. **Clue 13**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. This means the person who drives a minivan and the root beer lover must be in adjacent houses. Given Clue 12, the person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other, so the person who drives a minivan must be in House 2 and the basketball player in House 3. The root beer lover must be in House 3.
7. **Clue 12**: The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. This means the person who drives a minivan must be in House 2, and the basketball player must be in House 3.
8. **Clue 11**: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who owns an SUV must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Given Clue 10, the person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who likes red must be in House 2, and the golfer must be in House 3.
9. **Clue 10**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who likes red must be in House 2, and the golfer must be in House 3.
10. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer must be in House 2, and the person who only drinks water must be in House 3.
11. **Clue 8**: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes milk must be in House 5, and the person who likes yellow must be in House 4.
12. **Clue 6**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. This means the person who likes yellow must be in House 4, and the cricketer must be in House 5.
13. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. This means the person who owns a sedan must be in House 1, and the swimmer must be in House 2.
14. **Clue 9**: The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. This means the person who has a computer must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Given Clue 10, the person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who likes red must be in House 2, and the golfer must be in House 3.
15. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. This means the coffee drinker must be in House 4, and the person who has a television must be in House 5.

From the above deductions, the coffee drinker lives in House 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is **4**.

The correct answer is (E) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

Let's deduce the placements step by step:

- From Clue 4, the rose bouquet person can only be in house 1 or 3.
- From Clue 2, the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
- From Clue 3, the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

Let's consider the possible placements:

1. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

2. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

3. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

4. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

5. **If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:**
   - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
   - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
   - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the refined analysis, let's deduce the correct house for the person who likes milk.

1. **House 4: Lilies**
2. **House 5: Tulips**
3. **House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
4. **House 2: Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
5. **House 1: Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Not Lilies, Not Tulips**

From Clue 15, the person who likes milk and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other. Let's consider the possible positions for the violinist and the science fiction book fanatic:

- The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1).
- The violinist does not live in the fourth house (Clue 8).
- The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1).

Given these constraints, the only possible positions for the violinist and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- Science fiction book fanatic in House 2.
- Violinist in House 3.

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- House 1: Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Not Lilies, Not Tulips. This could be the person who likes milk or the person with a carnations arrangement.
- House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic.
- House 4: Lilies.
- House 5: Tulips.

Since the person who likes milk and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other, and the violinist is in House 3, the only possible positions for the person who likes milk are House 2 or House 4. However, House 4 is already taken by the lilies. Therefore, the person who likes milk must be in House 2.

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 2.

The answer is (C) 2."

   - This means the fourth house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

10. **The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.**
    - This means the SUV owner and the person who is eating a banana must be in adjacent houses.

11. **The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white.**
    - This means the minivan driver and the person who likes white must be in adjacent houses, and the minivan driver must be to the left of the person who likes white.

12. **The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.**
    - This means the SUV owner and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

13. **The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.**
    - This means the first house is occupied by the person who is eating kiwis.

14. **There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives.**
    - This means the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Given the constraints, the only possible positions for the swimmer and the cricketer are:
- Cricketer in the first house (yellow), and swimmer in the third house (blue).
- Cricketer in the third house (blue), and swimmer in the first house (yellow).

Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the cricketer must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house.

Now, let's fill in the remaining houses:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV or Person who is eating a banana.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

Since the person who likes green lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the first house. This leaves the person who likes green in the fourth house.

Now, the second house must be occupied by the person who likes white and the person who is eating oranges. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (yellow), and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the first house (yellow). Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.

This leaves the person who owns an SUV in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Green and Yellow**: The person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives directly next to the person who likes green.
   - Therefore, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

2. **Stew and Grilled Cheese**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house.

3. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

4. **Grilled Cheese**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house and the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

5. **Romance Book Lover**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the romance book lover lives in the second house, which is consistent with the previous information.

From the above deductions:
- **First House**: Person who ate grilled cheese
- **Second House**: Person who had stew, romance book lover
- **Third House**: Person who likes green, fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes blue lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. From clue 2, the cellist also lives in house 1. This directly contradicts clue 1, indicating that the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist cannot both be in house 1. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1, and the cellist must be in house 2.

From clue 3, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (who likes green) lives in house 1, the person who likes red must live in house 2.

This leaves the pianist to be the person who likes red and the mystery book reader to be the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green (the fantasy book enthusiast) lives in house 1, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the mystery book reader lives is **2**."

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The golfer lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff lives in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

From Clue 3, the history book buff lives in the first house. This confirms our arrangement:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

Now, using Clue 1: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives. This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in the first or third house because there would be no house between them and the swimmer. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Now, the swimmer must live in the first or third house. But since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the swimmer must live in the first house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Thus, the swimmer lives in the first house.

The number of the house where the swimmer lives is **(A) 1**."

"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The flutist does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The sedan owner is in house 1.
- The person with the bouquet of lilies is in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The flutist does not live in house 1, so the flutist must live in house 2.

Since the flutist lives in house 2, the person with the bouquet of lilies must also live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is:

(B) 2"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).
4. **Tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the tennis player is in house \(i+1\) or later.
5. **There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet**: This means if the rose bouquet is in house \(i\), the daffodils are in house \(i+1\) or \(i-1\).
6. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\).

### Deductions:
- **House 3**: Rose bouquet.
- **House 4**: Carnations arrangement.
- **House 2**: Fantasy book enthusiast (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer).
- **House 1**: Mystery book reader (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- **House 5**: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

### Final Placement:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player.
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast.

### Conclusion:
The romance book lover must be in house 2, as there are two houses between the mystery book reader (house 1) and the romance book lover.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Coffee drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Coffee drinker.

2. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the computer and gameboy cannot be in House 3. So, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

3. **The saxophonist does not live in the second house.**
   - Possible houses for saxophonist: 1, 3, 4, 5.

   - Possible houses for gameboy: 1, 3, 4, 5.

6. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - If the computer is in House 4, the gameboy must be in House 3 (but the coffee drinker is in House 3). So, the computer must be in House 5 and the gameboy in House 4.

7. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.**
   - Computer in House 5, so cellist must be in House 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the computer is in House 5, the percussionist must be in House 4 (but cellist is in House 4). So, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3 and the percussionist in House 5.

9. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
   - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

10. **The person who likes milk lives in the fifth house.**

    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

13. **The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

14. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
    - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means if the minivan driver is in house 2, the person wearing boots must be in house 1.
   - If the minivan driver is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

2. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the person with pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the person with pizza must be in house 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, the person with pizza must be in house 3 (but this is not possible since the person with pizza must be to the right).

3. **The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person wearing running shoes must live in either house 2 or 3.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means if the person with tulips is in house 2, the cricketer must be in house 1.
   - If the person with tulips is in house 3, the cricketer must be in house 2.

5. **The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with pizza must live in either house 1 or 3.

6. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means if the person with grilled cheese is in house 2, the person with sedan must be in house 1.
   - If the person with grilled cheese is in house 3, the person with sedan must be in house 2.

7. **The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person driving a minivan is in house 3.

8. **The golfer lives in the first house.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1.

9. **The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet must live in either house 1 or 3.

Now, let's combine all the clues:

- From clue 7, the person driving a minivan is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the golfer is in house 1.
- From clue 5, the person who had pizza cannot be in house 2, so the person who had pizza must be in house 1 or 3. Since the golfer is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.
- From clue 4, the cricketer must be in house 1 (since the person with tulips cannot be in house 1).
- From clue 3, the person wearing running shoes cannot be in house 1, so the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.
- From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since the person with sedan must be in house 1).
- From clue 2, the person with pizza (in house 3) must be to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since the person with pizza is in house 3, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.
- From clue 1, the person wearing boots must be in house 2 (since the person driving a minivan is in house 3).

Therefore, the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

8. **There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.**

From Clue 7, we know that Fried Rice lives in house 3.

From Clue 8, White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.

From Clue 2, Stew cannot be in house 2 or 4.

From Clue 3, Stew cannot be in house 4.

From Clue 1, Green cannot be in house 2.

From Clue 6, Red must be in house \(x-1\) if Stew is in house \(x\).

Let's try placing Stew and Red:
- If Stew is in house 1, Red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).
- If Stew is in house 1, Fried Rice is in house 3, and White and Yellow must be in houses 2 and 4 or 5.
- If Stew is in house 1, Fried Rice is in house 3, and White and Yellow must be in houses 2 and 4 or 5.

Let's try placing White and Yellow:
- If White is in house 2, Yellow must be in house 4 (Clue 8).
- If White is in house 2, Fried Rice is in house 3, and Green must be in house 5 (Clue 1).
- If White is in house 2, Yellow is in house 4, and Green is in house 5, then Red must be in house 4 (Clue 6).

This configuration does not work because Red cannot be in house 4.

Finally, let's try:
- If White is in house 2, Yellow must be in house 4 (Clue 8).
- If White is in house 2, Fried Rice is in house 3, and Green must be in house 5 (Clue 1).
- If White is in house 2, Yellow is in house 4, and Green is in house 5, then Red must be in house 5 (Clue 6).

This configuration does not work because Red cannot be in house 5.

Let's try another configuration:
- If White is in house 4, Yellow must be in house 2 (Clue 8).
- If White is in house 4, Fried Rice is in house 3, and Green must be in house 5 (Clue 1).
- If White is in house 4, Yellow is in house 2, and Green is in house 5, then Red must be in house 5 (Clue 6).

This configuration does not work because Red cannot be in house 5.

Finally, let's try:
- If White is in house 2, Yellow must be in house 4 (Clue 8).
- If White is in house 2, Fried Rice is in house 3, and Green must be in house 5 (Clue 1).
- If White is in house 2, Yellow is in house 4, and Green is in house 5, then Red must be in house 4 (Clue 6).

This configuration works:
- House 1: Green
- House 2: White
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

Thus, the person who likes white lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in house 2. This leaves us with houses 1, 3, and 4 for the remaining three people.

From Clue 2, the person who likes red lives in house 3. This means house 3 is occupied by the person who likes red.

From Clue 4, the person who likes yellow does not live in house 2. Since the percussionist is in house 2, the person who likes yellow must live in either house 1 or house 4.

From Clue 3, the basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. This means the tennis player cannot be in house 3 (since the person who likes red is there), and the basketball player cannot be in house 1 (since the tennis player cannot be in house 1).

Given the above, let's place the violinist:
- The violinist must be in a house to the right of the basketball player, and the tennis player must be to the left of the basketball player.

Let's try placing the tennis player in house 1:
- If the tennis player is in house 1, the basketball player must be in house 4 (since the violinist must be to the right of the basketball player).

This leaves house 3 for the person who likes red, which is consistent with Clue 2.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Tennis player
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: Person who likes red
- House 4: Violinist

Therefore, the basketball player lives in house 4.

The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (B) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of houses and their occupants. Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who has a computer lives directly left of the root beer lover.
2. **Clue 2**: The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
3. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover and the coffee drinker live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who has a television lives.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
6. **Clue 6**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the guitarist lives.
9. **Clue 9**: The cellist does not live in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
11. **Clue 11**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
12. **Clue 12**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
13. **Clue 13**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
14. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
15. **Clue 15**: The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
16. **Clue 16**: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.

Let's start by considering the possible positions for the person with the carnations arrangement:

- From Clue 7, the person with carnations cannot be in house 3.
- From Clue 15, the person with carnations cannot be in house 5.

Thus, the possible houses for the person with carnations are houses 1, 2, or 4.

Next, let's consider the root beer lover and the coffee drinker:

- From Clue 3, the root beer lover and the coffee drinker must be next to each other.
- From Clue 12, the root beer lover must be to the left of the percussionist.
- From Clue 13, the root beer lover must be to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies.

Given these constraints, let's test the possible positions for the root beer lover and the coffee drinker:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Let's test these scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Root beer lover in house 1, coffee drinker in house 2
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Root beer lover, Coffee drinker
- House 3: Cellist (since the cellist must be to the right of the person with the vase of tulips)
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies (since the bouquet of lilies must be to the left of the cellist)
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person with the bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the cellist (Clue 5), so the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 2. Since house 1 is taken by carnations, the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.
- The person with the computer must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
- The person with the phone must be in house 3 (Clue 11).
- The person with the television must be in house 4 (Clue 4).
- The person with the gameboy must be in house 5 (Clue 6).
- The person with the tea drinker must be in house 1 or 2. Since house 2 is taken by the coffee drinker, the tea drinker must be in house 1.

This arrangement does not work because the tea drinker cannot be in house 1 (since the root beer lover is there).

### Scenario 2: Root beer lover in house 2, coffee drinker in house 3
- House 2: Root beer lover, Coffee drinker
- House 3: Cellist
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies
- House 5: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:

- The person with the bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the cellist (Clue 5), so the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 2. Since house 2 is taken by the root beer lover, the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1.
- The person with the computer must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
- The person with the phone must be in house 3 (Clue 11).
- The person with the television must be in house 4 (Clue 4).
- The person with the gameboy must be in house 5 (Clue 6).
- The person with the tea drinker must be in house 1 or 2. Since house 2 is taken by the coffee drinker, the tea drinker must be in house 1.

This arrangement works because:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Root beer lover, Coffee drinker
- House 3: Cellist
- House 4: Bouquet of lilies
- House 5: Percussionist

Thus, the person with the carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (E) 1."

3. **Gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the radio.**
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in House 5 or 6, and the radio cannot be in House 1 or 2.

4. **Bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the truck.**
   - The truck cannot be in House 1 or 2, and the daffodils cannot be in House 5 or 6.

5. **Convertible and vase of tulips live directly next to each other.**
   - This means if the convertible is in House 4, the vase of tulips must be in House 5, and vice versa.

6. **There are two houses between the truck and the convertible.**
   - This means the truck and convertible must be in Houses 4 and 6.

7. **Minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.**
   - Since the dog owner is in House 2, the minivan must be in House 3, 4, 5, or 6. Given the truck and convertible are in Houses 4 and 6, the minivan must be in House 5.

8. **Computer does not live in the fifth house.**
   - The computer must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4.

9. **Bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house.**
   - The bouquet of lilies must be in House 1, 2, 3, or 4.

- **House 4: Convertible**
- **House 5: SUV**
- **House 6: Minivan**
- **House 1: Gameboy**

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
2. The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
3. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
4. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The basketball player lives in the first house.
6. The saxophonist lives in the first house.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

Given that the basketball player lives in the first house (house 1) and the saxophonist also lives in the first house (house 1), we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: ?
- House 3: ?

From Clue 7, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk. This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are not adjacent.

From Clue 4, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the pizza eater and the dog owner are adjacent.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives. This means the person who only drinks water and the fish enthusiast are not adjacent.

From Clue 2, the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer. This means the tea drinker and the cricketer are adjacent.

From Clue 1, there is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives. This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not adjacent.

Let's place the remaining people:
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Guitarist (since the cat lover and the guitarist are not adjacent and the cat lover cannot be in house 1)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (since the tea drinker and the cricketer are adjacent and the fish enthusiast cannot be in house 1)

Now, we need to place the remaining people:
- The tea drinker must be in house 2 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).
- The cricketer must be in house 2 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).
- The person who only drinks water must be in house 1 (since the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the fish enthusiast).
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).
- The dog owner must be in house 3 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).

This configuration works:
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Guitarist (tea drinker, pizza eater)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (cricketer, dog owner)

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

2. **History Book Buff**: The history book buff lives in the first house (house 1).
3. **Cat Lover**: The cat lover does not live in the second house (house 2).
4. **Computer and Loafers**: The person with a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing loafers.

From clue 2, we know the history book buff lives in house 1. Therefore, the person in house 1 has a history book and the person in house 2 has a romance book.

From clue 3, the cat lover does not live in house 2, so the cat lover must live in house 1. This contradicts the history book buff living in house 1. Therefore, the cat lover must live in house 2.

From clue 4, the person with a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person with loafers. Since the history book buff is in house 1, the person with a computer must be in house 2 (since house 1 is already taken by the history book buff).

So, the person with a computer lives in house 2, and the person with loafers must live in house 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: History book buff (romance book lover) and person with loafers (loafers)
- House 2: Cat lover (cat enthusiast) and person with computer (computer)

From clue 1, the person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person with loafers is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1. This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

Thus, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The history book buff lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. **Clue 12**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
4. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. **Clue 9**: The flutist does not live in the first house.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
11. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who likes green lives.
12. **Clue 11**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the history book buff in the second house:
1. History book buff (2)

Next, we need to place the person who had pizza and the person who ate fried rice. According to Clue 10 and Clue 12, the person who had pizza must be in the first house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the fourth house:
1. Pizza (1)
4. Fried rice (4)

Now, the person who likes blue and the percussionist must be placed such that the percussionist is to the left of the person who ate spaghetti, and there are two houses between the person who likes blue and the person who likes green:
1. Pizza (1)
2. Blue (3) or Blue (2)
4. Fried rice (4)
3. Spaghetti (3)

If Blue is in the second house, then the percussionist must be in the third house, and the person who likes green must be in the fourth house. But this contradicts the clue that the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. Therefore, Blue must be in the third house, and the percussionist must be in the second house:
1. Pizza (1)
2. Percussionist (2)
3. Blue (3)
4. Fried rice (4)

Now, the person who likes white and the romance book lover must be placed such that the person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover:
1. Pizza (1)
2. Percussionist (2)
3. Blue (3)
4. Fried rice (4)
3. White (1)
4. Romance book lover (4)

Finally, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fourth house, which is already occupied by the romance book lover. This is a contradiction. Therefore, Blue must be in the third house, and the person who likes white must be in the first house:
1. White (1)
2. Percussionist (2)
3. Blue (3)
4. Fried rice (4)
3. White (1)
4. Romance book lover (4)

This arrangement is still incorrect. Let's try placing the person who likes white in the second house:

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

**Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

**Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

**Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
- If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
- If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).
- There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (Clue 4).

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating kiwis lives in house 1. This means house 1 is occupied by the person who eats kiwis.

Given that the fantasy book enthusiast cannot live in house 1 (clue 1), the only remaining house for the fantasy book enthusiast is house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues, let's analyze the situation logically:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
   - This means the root beer lover must live in the first house.

2. **Clue 2:** The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.
   - This means the pianist and the cellist must be in adjacent houses, with the pianist in the house to the left of the cellist.

Given the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the root beer lover lives in the first house (house 1), we can deduce the following:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the pianist and the cellist must be in houses 1 and 2.
- Since the pianist must be to the left of the cellist, the pianist must be in house 1 and the cellist must be in house 2.

   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are separated by one house.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are in different houses, and the person with tulips is to the right of the person with daffodils.

   - This means the houses occupied by these two people are adjacent, and the person with boots is to the left of the person with carnations.

8. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing sandals does not live in the fifth house.
   - This means the fifth house is not occupied by the person with sandals.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- Fifth house: Person with carnations.
- Fourth house: Not tulips.
- Third house: Not daffodils (since daffodils and running shoes are adjacent).
- Second house: Not tulips (since tulips are to the right of daffodils).
- First house: Not sandals (since sandals are not in the fifth house).

Now, let's place the people based on the clues:
- The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with boots and the person with carnations are adjacent, so the fourth house is not occupied by boots.
- The person with sandals is not in the fifth house, so the fourth house is not occupied by sandals.
- The person with tulips is to the right of the person with daffodils.
- The person with tulips is not in the fourth house.
- The person with tulips is adjacent to the person with loafers.
- The person with running shoes and the person with daffodils are adjacent, and the person with running shoes is one house away from the person with lilies.

Let's place the remaining people:
- The person with sandals is in the first house.
- The person with boots is in the fourth house.
- The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with tulips is in the third house (since it is to the right of the person with daffodils and adjacent to the person with loafers).
- The person with daffodils is in the second house (since it is adjacent to the person with running shoes and the person with tulips is in the third house).
- The person with running shoes is in the second house (since it is adjacent to the person with daffodils and one house away from the person with lilies).
- The person with lilies is in the fourth house (since it is one house away from the person with running shoes).

Thus, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. From Clue 4, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or third house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house (since the person who had stew cannot live in the second house).

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who likes white must live in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew.

Now, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. The person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the second house (Clue 3), so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. Since the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or second house. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other (Clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker (CD) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW). This means the CD cannot be in house 2, and the SW cannot be in house 1.
2. **Clue 2:** The science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in house 1.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The SF lives in house 1.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The CD cannot be in house 1, so the CD must be in house 2.
- The SW cannot be in house 1, so the SW must be in house 1.

This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to the remaining houses. Since the CD is in house 2 and the SW is in house 1, the water drinker must be in house 1, and the romance book lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the percussionist and the person with the radio are neighbors, and the percussionist is to the left of the person with the radio.

Given the house numbers:
- House 1: Person 1
- House 2: Person 2

Considering the possible positions for the percussionist and the person with the radio:
- If the percussionist is in House 1, then the person with the radio must be in House 2.
- If the percussionist is in House 2, then the person with the radio must be in House 1.

Since the percussionist and the person with the radio must be neighbors, the only possible arrangement is:
- The percussionist is in House 1.
- The person with the radio is in House 2.

2. **Clue 2:** Each person plays a different musical instrument: one is a pianist and one is a percussionist.
   - Since the percussionist is in House 1, the pianist must be in House 2.

3. **Clue 3:** Each person has a different device: one has a radio and one has a phone.
   - Since the person with the radio is in House 2, the person with the phone must be in House 1.

Therefore, the person with the phone lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:
(A) 1"

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know the second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 2, the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them. This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3.

From clue 3, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Given the positions of the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan, the only way this can be satisfied is if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3 and the person who likes yellow is in house 2.

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From Clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Fried Rice
- House 3: ?

From Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. So, the arrangement is now:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: ?

From Clue 2, the person who ate fried rice (in the second house) lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the fried rice person is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the second house. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: ?

From Clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the fried rice person is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Spaghetti Eater
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: ?

Now, the only person left to place is the grilled cheese eater. Since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in House 1 (because the science fiction book fanatic is there) and cannot be in House 3 (because the grilled cheese eater cannot be to the right of the fried rice eater), the grilled cheese eater must be in House 3:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Spaghetti Eater
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: Grilled Cheese Eater

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is **2**.

**Correct option:** (B) 2"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2 (the right house).

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (the left house).

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - Since the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 1 (because the tea drinker cannot be in house 2).

From these deductions:
- The person wearing sandals is in house 1.
- The person eating grapes is in house 1 (since they live next to the person wearing sandals).
- The tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (since they live to the right of the person wearing sandals and cannot be in house 1).

Therefore, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is eating kiwis lives is **(A) 2**."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
2. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
4. The violinist does not live in the third house.

Given the tea drinker is in house 1, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Cellist (since the cellist cannot be in house 3, and the cellist must be to the right of the water drinker)
- House 3: Violinist (since the violinist cannot be in house 3, and there must be one house between the violinist and the guitarist)

Since the cellist is in house 2 and the violinist is in house 3, the guitarist must be in house 1. However, house 1 is already occupied by the tea drinker. Therefore, the guitarist must be in house 2, making house 3 the only remaining option for the guitarist.

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the third house is occupied by someone wearing sandals. From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing sandals is in the third house.

From Clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 2, the person who is wearing running shoes cannot live in the first house.

From Clue 5, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5. Since the third house is occupied by someone wearing sandals, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water (in the fourth house) must be to the left of the person who is wearing boots (in the first house).

Given these constraints, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who is wearing boots
- Second house: Person who is wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person who likes milk (and wearing sandals)
- Fourth house: Person who only drinks water
- Fifth house: Person who drinks tea

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."

- House 1: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

Grilled cheese and spaghetti must be adjacent, so they could be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Let's try house 1 and 2:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza

Now, the gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house. The only possible positions are house 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since house 4 is occupied by pizza, the gameboy and fried rice must be in houses 2 and 3:
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Pizza

Now, the computer and computer cannot be in house 4, so they must be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5. Since house 1 is occupied by radio and house 2 is occupied by grilled cheese, the computer must be in house 5:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Computer

Finally, the phone and television must be in houses with the phone to the left of the television. The only possible positions are house 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since house 2 is occupied by grilled cheese, the phone must be in house 1 and the television in house 3:
- House 1: Phone
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Fried rice
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Computer

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 3.

The number of the house where the person who ate spaghetti lives is **3**.

From clue 5, the person who ate fried"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of the individuals:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 2, because the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2 or 3, and the bird keeper must be in house 1 or 2. Since the bird keeper cannot be in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Since the percussionist cannot be in house 2, the percussionist must be in house 1.

From this, we know:
- The percussionist lives in house 1.
- The grilled cheese eater lives in house 2.
- The bird keeper lives in house 1 (but since the grilled cheese eater is already in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2).

This leaves the guitarist and the pizza eater to be placed in the remaining houses (houses 1 and 2). Since the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2 (because the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the pizza eater cannot be in house 2).

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's systematically deduce the placement of each person and their characteristics:

1. **Clue 2**: The bird keeper lives in the third house.
   - Bird keeper: House 3

2. **Clue 1**: The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Cat lover: House 1, 2, or 4

3. **Clue 3**: The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
   - Golfer and truck driver cannot be adjacent.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
   - Convertible driver: House 2, 3, or 4

5. **Clue 5**: The baseball player does not live in the third house.
   - Baseball player: House 1, 2, or 4

6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - This is consistent with Clue 5.

7. **Clue 7**: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.
   - Sedan owner: House 2, 3, or 4 (to the right of the baseball player)

8. **Clue 8**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - Soccer player: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the bird keeper)

9. **Clue 9**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.
   - Fish enthusiast: House 1, 2, or 4 (to the left of the soccer player)

Given Clue 2, the bird keeper lives in house 3. Let's place the other constraints:

- Convertible driver cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Baseball player cannot be in house 3, so they can be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
- Sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player, so if the baseball player is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 4. If the baseball player is in house 2, the sedan owner must be in house 4. If the baseball player is in house 4, the sedan owner must be in house 2 or 3 (but house 3 is taken by the bird keeper).

Let's try placing the convertible driver in house 1:
- Convertible driver in house 1
- Baseball player in house 2 (since they cannot be in house 3)
- Sedan owner in house 4 (to the right of the baseball player)

This leaves house 3 for the bird keeper and house 4 for the sedan owner. The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 or 2, but house 1 is taken by the convertible driver. So the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the sedan owner, house 2 for the fish enthusiast, and house 3 for the bird keeper.

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the constraints and the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 10, we know the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses, respectively, or the third and first houses, respectively. Since the fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in the second house (Clue 3), the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

From Clue 5, the fish enthusiast must be in the third house or the first house. Since the flutist is in the third house, the fish enthusiast must be in the first house.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the first house, and the fish enthusiast is in the first house, so the person who is wearing running shoes must be the fish enthusiast. This contradicts Clue 5, so the fish enthusiast must be in the third house, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the second house.

From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house, and the pianist must be in the first house.

From Clue 6, the flutist (in the third house) must be to the right of the fish enthusiast (in the first house).

From Clue 4, the history book buff must be in the first house, and the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, the percussionist must be in the second house.

From Clue 1, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who is eating a banana (second house)
- Second house: Person who is wearing running shoes (fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Person who is eating oranges (pianist)

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the **3rd** house. The correct answer is (C) 3."

   - House 4: ?

2. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana must be in houses 1 and 3, or houses 2 and 4. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

3. **Clue 4**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes green must be in a house to the left of the person who likes yellow. Given the arrangement so far, the person who likes green must be in house 1 or house 2. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who likes white, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This contradicts Clue 6, which states that the person who is eating grapes is in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: Yellow

4. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who likes red lives in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, this clue is satisfied. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3 and the person who is eating kiwis must be in a house to the right of house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4. So, the arrangement is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Kiwis

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. The correct answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the cat lover.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the person who had stew.

Given these clues, let's deduce the arrangement:

- Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.
- The person who had stew must be next to the mystery book reader, and the mystery book reader must be next to the cat lover.
- The only way to fit all these clues is to place the person who had stew in house 1, the person wearing running shoes in house 2, the mystery book reader in house 1, and the cat lover in house 3.

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
3. The root beer lover lives in the first house.
4. The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
5. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in house 1. From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2. From Clue 4, the person who has a television cannot live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. However, since the root beer lover is already in house 1, the person with the television must live in house 3.

From Clue 1, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person with the television is in house 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2 (because house 1 is taken by the root beer lover and house 3 is taken by the person with the television). Therefore, the person with the phone must be in house 1.

This leaves house 3 for the person who likes root beer, and house 2 for the person who only drinks water. The only remaining house, house 1, must be for the person who has a bouquet of tulips.

Thus, the person who likes root beer lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Wearing loafers

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - Phone: House 1, 2
   - Mangos: House 2, 3

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - Grapes: House 1, 2
   - Water: House 2, 3

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - Boots: House 1, 2

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - Kiwis: House 1, 2
   - Milk: House 2, 3

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Boots: House 1, 2
   - Gameboy: House 1, 2, 3

7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - Kiwis: House 2, 3

### Deductions

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers (Clue 1)
- **House 2:** Phone, Boots, Gameboy (Clue 2, Clue 6)
- **House 3:** Mangos, Milk, Kiwis (Clue 2, Clue 5)

From Clue 3, grapes and water must be in adjacent houses. Given the constraints:

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers
- **House 2:** Phone, Boots, Gameboy
- **House 3:** Mangos, Milk, Kiwis

Since the person with the phone is in House 2, the person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy. The person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy, so the person with the phone is the one who has a computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

The answer is (A) 2."

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating oranges.

2. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - This means the truck and convertible drivers must be in adjacent houses, and the truck driver must be to the left of the convertible driver.

3. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the bird keeper and dog owner must be in houses with the bird keeper to the right of the dog owner.

4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not eating mangos.

5. The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Owning horses.

6. The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 5, we know:
- House 3: Owning horses.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Eating oranges.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 3: Not eating mangos.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in adjacent houses.

Since the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), and the person driving a convertible must be adjacent to the person eating mangos (Clue 6), the only possible positions for the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible are:
- House 1: Eating oranges (Clue 1)
- House 2: Driving a convertible (Clue 6)
- House 3: Owning horses (Clue 5)

Now, we need to place the bird keeper and the dog owner. From Clue 3, the bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are 2 and 3, but house 3 is occupied by the person owning horses. Therefore, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 1. Given that house 1 is occupied by the person eating oranges, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 3.

Thus, the only remaining house for the person driving a truck is house 2.

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics:

1. **Clue 1 and Clue 2**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew, and the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader must be somewhere to the left of the percussionist, and the percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader. This implies the mystery book reader and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

2. **Clue 3**: The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the percussionist.

3. **Clue 4**: There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives. This means the saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, and the person who had pizza must be in the second or fourth house.

4. **Clue 5**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader.

5. **Clue 6**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist. This means the flutist must be in a house to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

6. **Clue 7**: The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist. This means the guitarist and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist.

7. **Clue 8**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader. This means the mystery book reader and the grilled cheese eater must be in adjacent houses, and the grilled cheese eater must be to the right of the mystery book reader.

8. **Clue 9**: There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives. This means the history book buff must be in the house directly to the right or left of the mystery book reader.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house. This means the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the first, second, fourth, or fifth houses.

Let's start by placing the mystery book reader and the saxophonist:
- The saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, so he must be in the second or fourth house.
- The mystery book reader must be directly left of the saxophonist, so the saxophonist must be in the second house and the mystery book reader must be in the first house.

Now, let's place the percussionist:
- The percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the percussionist must be in the third or fourth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist, so the guitarist must be in the first or second house.

Given the saxophonist is in the second house, the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the guitarist is to the left of the percussionist, the only possible positions for the percussionist are the third or fourth house. Let's check the third house:
- If the percussionist is in the third house, the guitarist must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the percussionist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the science fiction book fanatic:
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house because the mystery book reader is there.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the second house.

Now, let's place the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist:
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or second house, but the first house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.
- Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Finally, let's place the history book buff:
- The history book buff must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the history book buff must be in the third house, and the flutist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the person who ate spaghetti:
- The person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

### Conclusion:
The percussionist lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues and the logical deductions, the person who is eating mangos lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 5"
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who has a radio lives in house 3.
   - House 3: Radio

2. **Clue 8**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
   - This means the percussionist and the person who likes white must be in adjacent houses, with the percussionist in a lower-numbered house.

3. **Clue 9**: The person who likes red does not live in house 2.
   - This means the person who likes red cannot be in house 2.

4. **Clue 10**: The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means the computer and phone must be in adjacent houses, with the computer in a lower-numbered house.

5. **Clue 11**: The person who has a computer does not live in house 2.
   - This means the computer cannot be in house 2.

6. **Clue 12**: The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means the computer and phone must be in adjacent houses, with the computer in a lower-numbered house.

7. **Clue 6**: The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the phone and gameboy must be in adjacent houses, with the phone in a higher-numbered house.

8. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the guitarist lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
   - This means the guitarist and the person who likes yellow must be in houses 2 and 4 or 4 and 2.

9. **Clue 3**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the television and the person who likes red must be in adjacent houses, with the television in a lower-numbered house.

10. **Clue 2**: The cellist does not live in house 5.
    - This means the cellist cannot be in house 5.

11. **Clue 1**: The percussionist and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
    - This means the percussionist and guitarist must be in adjacent houses.

12. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives in house 3.
    - House 3: Green

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 3: Green
- House 3: Radio
- House 3: Computer (since the computer must be to the left of the phone, and the computer cannot be in house 2)
- House 3: Phone (since the computer is in house 3, the phone must be in house 4)
- House 3: Gameboy (since the phone is in house 4, the gameboy must be in house 3)
- House 3: Television (since the television lives directly left of the person who likes red, and the television is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2)
- House 2: Red
- House 2: Percussionist (since the percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white, and the percussionist is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 3)
- House 3: White
- House 3: Saxophonist (since the saxophonist must be in the remaining house, which is house 1)
- House 1: Saxophonist
- House 1: Guitarist (since the guitarist lives directly next to the percussionist, and the percussionist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1)
- House 1: Green (already confirmed)
- House 1: Cellist (since the cellist does not live in house 5, and the cellist cannot be in house 1, the cellist must be in house 4)
- House 4: Cellist
- House 4: Television (since the television lives directly left of the person who likes red, and the television is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2)
- House 2: Red
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 2: White (already confirmed)
- House 2: Guitarist (already confirmed)
- House 2: Cellist (already confirmed)
- House 2: Television (already confirmed)
- House 5: Violinist (since the violinist lives two houses away from the percussionist, and the percussionist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 5)
- House 5: Violinist

Thus, the saxophonist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist (in house 1) and the mystery book reader (in house 2) cannot be in the reverse order.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - This means the history book buff (in house 1) and the cat lover (in house 2) cannot be in the reverse order.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - This means they must be in houses 1 and 2, but not necessarily in the order of Clue 2.

Given Clue 1, the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2. Given Clue 2, the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2. Given Clue 3, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, but since the history book buff is already in house 1, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2 in the order of Clue 3.

Therefore, the root beer lover is in house 1 and the guitarist is in house 2.

The person who owns horses lives in house 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

Let's break it down step by step:

- From Clue 1, if the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this scenario is not possible.
- From Clue 2, the dog owner cannot be in house 2.
- From Clue 3, the person with the vase of tulips must be in a house to the right of the dog owner.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper must be in house 2 (since house 3 is ruled out by Clue 1). The carnations arrangement must be in house 3. The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 (since house 3 is to the right of house 1 and the dog owner). This scenario works.
- If the dog owner is in house 3, the bird keeper must be in house 1 (since house 2 is ruled out by Clue 1). The carnations arrangement must be in house 2. The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 (since house 2 is to the right of house 1 and the bird keeper). This scenario works, but it contradicts Clue 2 because the dog owner cannot be in house 3.

Therefore, the only consistent scenario is when the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**."

- **House 4**: Swimmer
- **House 2**: Computer
- **House 1**: Oranges
- **House 3**: Not apples, not kiwis, not loafers, not lilies, not banana, not rose bouquet, not gameboy

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating mangos.

2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not horses.

3. The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, and vice versa.

4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not banana.

5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not horses.

6. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the person eating a banana is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 2. This is because the banana eater cannot be in house 3, and the dog owner cannot be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not banana, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana.
- House 4: Not horses.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in adjacent houses. Since the person eating bananas is in house 1, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From Clue 5, the person who owns horses cannot be in house 2. Since the dog owner is in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Eating bananas, not horses, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not banana, dog owner.
- House 3: Not banana, bird keeper or eating kiwis.
- House 4: Not horses, owns horses.

Since the person eating kiwis must be in house 3 (since they must be adjacent to the bird keeper), the bird keeper must be in house 4.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 4. The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives in the first house (House 1).
   - House 1: Mystery book reader

2. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the bird keeper must be in adjacent houses, and since the mystery book reader is in House 1, the only possible adjacent houses are Houses 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the bird keeper must live in House 3 (since the romance book lover cannot live in House 3, and the bird keeper must be in an adjacent house).

4. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
   - Since the bird keeper lives in House 3, the romance book lover must live in House 2.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Bird keeper

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(B) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
   - This directly places the coffee drinker in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, with the apple eater to the left of the water drinker.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 2, 3, or 4.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 1 or 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the apple eater must be in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.
   - This means the kiwi eater lives in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- If the mangos eater is in house 1, then the kiwi eater must be in house 4 (since they cannot be in house 3).
- The apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Mangos eater
  - House 2: Coffee drinker (Clue 1)
  - House 3: Apple eater
  - House 4: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The mangos eater is in house 1.
- The kiwi eater is in house 4.
- The water drinker is in house 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.

10. **Clue 11:** The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
11. **Clue 12:** The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From Clue 7, the soccer player lives in the third house (house 3).

From Clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house (house 5).

From Clue 9, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana lives in house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must live in house 2.

From Clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 2, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 1, and the baseball player must live in house 4.

From Clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer cannot live in house 5, and the golfer must be to the left of the cricketer, the golfer must live in house 1, and the cricketer must live in house 4.

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives. Since the person who likes white lives in house 2 (where the person who is eating kiwis lives), the person who likes blue must live in house 4 (where the cricketer lives).

From Clue 1, the person who likes white (house 2) lives directly left of the person who likes red (house 4). Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who likes red must live in house 1.

From Clue 3, the person who likes white (house 2) lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player (house 4). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the person who likes white (house 2) lives and where the person who is eating apples (house 4). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From Clue 6, the cricketer (house 4) does not live in the fifth house, which is consistent.

From Clue 9, the person who is eating kiwis (house 2) and the person who is eating a banana (house 3) live directly next to each other, which is consistent.

Thus, the person who is eating a banana lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (D) 3."

From Clue 6, the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the minivan must be in house 2, and the flutist must be in house 1.

From Clue 5, the minivan (in house 2) is to the right of the truck. Therefore, the truck must be in house 1, and the person with the gameboy must be in house 3 (since the truck and the gameboy are next to each other).

From Clue 3, the minivan (in house 2) and the cellist must be next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 3.

From Clue 4, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with the television must be in house 1, and the person with high heels must be in house 2.

From Clue 7, the person who is wearing boots must be to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots is in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.
- The truck driver is to the right of the root beer lover.
- The minivan driver is not in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

15. **Clue 15:** The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house.

From Clue 6, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. From Clue 8, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. From Clue 9, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. From Clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house, so the sedan owner must live in either the first, third, or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must live in either the first or third house.

From Clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. From Clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. From Clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. From Clue 7, the flutist lives in the third house. Therefore, the cellist must live in the second house (since the flutist lives in the third house and they must be next to each other).

Now, let's summarize the known information:
- Second house: Flutist
- Third house: Cellist
- Fourth house: Person who owns an SUV (and also the person who likes white)

Since the sedan owner cannot be in the second house (Clue 15) and the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must be in the first house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in House 3 (since there is no house to the left of House 3), and the person who likes white must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 2 is already taken by the person who likes red, the person who likes white must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3.

   - House 2: Red
   - House 1: White

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.

   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

7. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - This is already confirmed as House 3.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.
- The person who has a television must be in House 4.
- The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the placement of each person:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper lives in the second house.
   - This directly tells us the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the violinist cannot live in house number 1, and the bouquet of lilies cannot live in house number 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot live in house number 4, and the person who had pizza cannot live in house number 1.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
   - This means the violinist and the person with the rose bouquet must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner must live in the house immediately to the right of the person with the vase of tulips.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
   - This means the saxophonist cannot live in house number 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house number 4.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot live in house number 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot live in house number 4.

8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot live in house number 4, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot live in house number 1.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the person who owns horses lives in house number 4.

10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1.

From Clue 1, we know the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper (house 2) must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (house 4). Since the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4, the bird keeper must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza must be to the right of the guitarist. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 4, the person who had pizza must be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 1.

From Clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 (guitarist), and the dog owner must be in house 2 (bird keeper).

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese (house 1) must be to the left of the guitarist (house 1), which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the placement.

Given the constraints, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who owns horses

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the saxophonist and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (house 1).
   - Therefore, the saxophonist is in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

Given that the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2 (Clue 2). This leaves house 1 for the baseball player and house 2 for the person eating grapes.

Now, combining Clue 3 and Clue 5:
- The baseball player and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.
- The romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the tea drinker and the baseball player.

### Remaining Assignments:
- House 1: Tea drinker, Baseball player
- House 2: Person eating grapes, Golfer

Since the romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2, and the golfer is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 1.

### Final Assignments:
- House 1: Tea drinker, Romance book lover, Baseball player
- House 2: Person eating grapes, Golfer

The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2, as the person eating grapes is in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."

Next, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The second house cannot be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies (Clue 1).
- The second house cannot be occupied by the person wearing high heels (Clue 2).

This means the second house must be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies and the person wearing high heels.

Therefore, the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

14. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.

Let's start by placing the tea drinker in the first house (Clue 2).

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 5: Vase of tulips (Clue 4)
- House 2: Bouquet of lilies (Clue 5)
- House 3: Root beer lover (Clue 11, cannot be in house 3)
- House 4: Coffee drinker (Clue 14, must be somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow)
- House 6: Root beer lover (Clue 11, cannot be in house 6)
- House 7: Root beer lover (Clue 11, cannot be in house 7)
- House 8: Root beer lover (Clue 11, cannot be in house 8)
- House 9: Root beer lover (Clue 11, cannot be in house 9)
- House 10: Root beer lover (Clue 11, cannot be in house 10)

Since the root beer lover cannot be in houses 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, the root beer lover must be in house 1 (Clue 11).

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 3: Root beer lover

- House 2: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover
- House 8: Root beer lover
- House 9: Root beer lover
- House 10: Root beer lover

Now, let's place the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red (Clue 9).

- Since they live directly next to each other, they must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6.
- Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the yellow and red lovers must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6.

Let's place the yellow lover in house 5 and the red lover in house 4 (Clue 9).

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 3: Root beer lover
- House 5: Yellow lover
- House 2: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Red lover
- House 6: Root beer lover

- The grilled cheese eater lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
- The person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 2) lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

- House 2: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover

- House 2: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover
- House 8: Root beer lover
- House 9: Root beer lover
- House 10: Root beer lover

Next, let's place the person who likes white and the person who likes green (Clue 10).

- The person who likes white lives one house to the left of the person who likes green.
- The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live directly next to each other (Clue 9).

Let's place the person who likes white in house 2 (Clue 10).

- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 3: Spaghetti eater
- House 5: Yellow lover
- House 2: White lover
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover

- House 9: Root beer lover
- House 10: Root beer lover

Finally, let's place the person who likes green (Clue 13).

- The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who likes green.
- The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow (Clue 14).

Let's place the person who likes green in house 4 (Clue 13).

- House 4: Green lover
- House 6: Root beer lover

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and deduce the characteristics of each person in the houses.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

Let's denote the houses as follows:
- House 1: Person 1
- House 2: Person 2

### Step-by-Step Deduction

**From Clue 3:**
- If Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck.
- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.

Since Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow (because Person 2 (House 2) would also like yellow, leading to a contradiction), Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow.

**From Clue 1:**
- If Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, then Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes (Clue 1).

This creates a contradiction because Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow and eat grapes simultaneously. Therefore, Person 1 (House 1) cannot like yellow.

Thus, Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow.

**From Clue 2:**
- If Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, then Person 2 (House 2) wears boots (Clue 2).
- If Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck, then Person 1 (House 1) wears boots (Clue 2).

Since Person 1 (House 1) cannot wear boots (because Person 2 (House 2) would also wear boots, leading to a contradiction), Person 2 (House 2) must wear boots.

**Remaining Characteristics:**
- Person 1 (House 1) likes red.
- Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow.
- Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck.
- Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes.
- Person 1 (House 1) wears boots.
- Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader.

The only remaining characteristic is the fantasy book enthusiast. Since Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader, Person 1 (House 1) must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

### Conclusion

The fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 1**.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 1."

"To solve this logic puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. The violinist lives in the first house (house 1).
2. The person with a computer lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Violinist
- House 2: Computer owner (and not the bird keeper)

From clue 2, the computer owner must be to the left of the bird keeper. Since the computer owner is in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the house where the person with the computer lives:

Since the person with the computer must live somewhere to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 4 or 5, and the person with the computer must be in a house to the right of the bouquet of daffodils, the only possible house for the computer is house 5.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in house 5.

The answer is (E) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Boots

2. **Clue 4:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - Since the person wearing boots lives in house 2, the person who owns an SUV must live in house 1.
   - House 1: SUV

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Sedan

4. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - Since the person wearing boots lives in house 2, the person who is wearing high heels must live in house 1.
   - House 1: High Heels
   - House 2: Boots
   - House 3: Sedan

5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - House 1: High Heels
   - House 2: Boots
   - House 3: Sedan

Since the person wearing high heels lives in house 1, and the cat lover lives in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be the cat lover. This leaves the person wearing running shoes to live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who is eating apples:

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Tea drinker

2. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
   - House 1: Kiwis, Person who likes blue
   - House 2: Tulips, Person who likes green, Person who is eating oranges

3. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 3, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in Houses 1 and 2.

4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations

5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Tulips

6. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.
   - House 1: Running shoes, Person who likes green
   - House 2: Tulips, Person who likes blue, Person who is eating oranges

7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the third house.
   - The person who is eating oranges must live in either House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 already has the person with carnations, the person who is eating oranges must live in House 2.

Since the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other, and the only remaining house for the person who likes milk is House 3, the person who is eating apples must be in House 2.

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's re-evaluate the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
4. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who has a television.

From Clue 2, we know the mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as Mystery Reader (MR), History Book Buff (HBB), and Science Fiction Fanatic (SFF).

From Clue 1, the mystery book reader (MR) must be in the first house, and the history book buff (HBB) must be in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the history book buff (HBB), which contradicts Clue 1. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Since the mystery book reader (MR) is in the first house, the history book buff (HBB) must be in the third house. This means the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: ?
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the person who has a computer (C). So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 3, the person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P). Since the person with the computer is in the second house, the person with the phone must be in the first house. This means the person with the phone is the mystery book reader (MR). This is consistent with Clue 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB (history book buff)

The person who has a phone is the mystery book reader (MR), and the person who has a computer is in the second house. The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic (SFF), who must be in the third house.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

St. Vitus's Dance, a condition associated with rheumatic fever, is characterized by involuntary, rapid, and irregular movements. Ballet performances require precise and controlled movements, making it highly unlikely for someone with St. Vitus's Dance to excel in such competitions. The disorder affects the ability to perform the intricate and precise movements needed for ballet, thus significantly diminishing their chances of winning."

It is not impossible for pigs to use pig Latin. The ability to use pig Latin, like any other language, requires understanding and manipulation of phonemes and rules of a specific language structure. While pigs do not possess the cognitive capacity to understand or produce human languages, they can be trained to perform tasks and respond to commands. The concept of pig Latin, as a playful language game, is based on human linguistic rules and does not inherently require the ability to understand or produce such rules. Therefore, it is theoretically possible for pigs to be taught to mimic the phonetic shifts of pig Latin, though this would be a highly unusual and artificial form of communication."

Growing seedless cucumbers can be challenging for a gardener with entomophobia due to the need for pollination, which often involves insects. While there are methods to pollinate seedless cucumbers manually, the presence of insects during the process might still trigger anxiety or fear. It might be more comfortable to focus on growing regular cucumbers, which do not require pollination and thus do not involve insects."
"To determine if Martin Luther would run out of theses in half a year if he wrote one per day, we need to calculate the total number of theses he could produce in 182.5 days.

If he writes one thesis per day, in 182.5 days, he would produce:

\[ 182.5 \text{ theses} \]

Since he would have completed 182 theses in 182 days and would have started the 183rd thesis on the 183rd day, he would not run out of theses in half a year.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"
"Given the refined context as an expert in comparing dance styles, let's break down the physical demands and risks of waltz and slam dance:

1. **Waltz**:
   - Typically involves slow, flowing movements.
   - Low-impact, with a focus on grace and elegance.
   - Generally considered less injurious compared to more energetic dance styles.

2. **Slam Dance**:
   - Without a clear definition, it could refer to various styles, but often implies a more energetic, potentially high-impact dance.
   - The term ""slam dance"" is not standard and could vary widely in its physical demands.

Without a precise definition, it's challenging to definitively state which is less injurious. However, based on the general understanding of dance styles, waltz is typically associated with lower physical demands and is generally considered less injurious compared to more energetic dance forms.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) No"

Snowboarding on Venus would be highly impractical due to the planet's extreme conditions. Venus has a surface temperature of approximately 462°C (864°F) and a pressure that is about 92 times greater than Earth's at sea level. The atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making it impossible for snow to exist in a form suitable for snowboarding. The extreme heat, pressure, and corrosive nature of the atmosphere would make it impossible to engage in any snow-related activities, including snowboarding."
"The Battle of Tours, fought in 732, was a pivotal moment in European history. It was a decisive victory for the Frankish forces led by Charles Martel over the Umayyad Caliphate's forces.

"(B) Yes

Ariana Grande can be a highly relevant topic in a presentation about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Given her public disclosure of her struggles with PTSD following the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, her story can serve as a powerful and relatable example.

"Euphoria is indeed commonly associated with drug addiction. Many drugs, particularly those that act on the brain's reward system, can induce feelings of intense pleasure and well-being, often referred to as euphoria. This sensation can be highly addictive, as it reinforces the behavior of seeking the drug to achieve it. However, the experience of euphoria can vary significantly between different drugs and individuals, and it is not the only effect or the primary reason for addiction. The psychological and physiological changes that occur can lead to compulsive drug use, even in the absence of euphoria."
"Given the context of comparing fictional characters from literature, it's important to consider the attributes and abilities of Apollo and D'Artagnan as portrayed in their respective works.

Apollo, in Greek mythology, is a god associated with prophecy, healing, and the sun. His powers are often supernatural and not necessarily tied to physical combat prowess. On the other hand, D'Artagnan from ""The Three Musketeers"" is a trained musketeer known for his bravery, loyalty, and physical prowess.

Considering these descriptions, it is reasonable to assume that D'Artagnan, with his training and experience, would be a formidable opponent. However, without knowing the exact abilities and powers of Apollo, it is difficult to definitively say whether he could defeat D'Artagnan.

Therefore, based on the information available, the most reasonable answer is:

(A) No"

Sunscreen is not unhelpful for the condition that killed Bob Marley, as it is a preventive measure against skin cancer, which is what he died from. However, it is important to note that sunscreen does not treat existing skin cancer. Bob Marley died from advanced melanoma, which was not caused by sun exposure but rather by the progression of the disease. Therefore, while using sunscreen is a good preventive measure, it is not a treatment for skin cancer."
"The French Defense, as a standard opening, does not inherently include the four-move checkmate sequence.

Avoiding internet trolls on Reddit is challenging due to their nature as a part of the community. However, there are several strategies you can employ to minimize their impact:

1. **Ignore and Report**: Trolls often seek attention, so ignoring their posts and reporting them can help reduce their visibility.
2. **Use Filters and Subreddit Settings**: Some subreddits have filters or settings that can help reduce the number of troll posts you see.
3. **Stay Alert and Vigilant**: Be aware of the signs of troll behavior and be prepared to take action if necessary.
4. **Engage with Respect**: Sometimes, engaging with trolls in a respectful manner can help defuse the situation, but this is not always effective and can sometimes escalate the situation.
5. **Use Moderators**: If a troll is causing significant disruption, flagging the post or the user to the subreddit's moderators can help.

These strategies can help mitigate the impact of trolls, but it's important to recognize that they are a part of the Reddit community and may always be present to some degree."

The most expensive color in the world is not blue. While ultramarine, a deep blue pigment, is considered one of the most expensive due to its production process, which involves processing lapis lazuli, the term ""most expensive color"" is often used more broadly to describe the high cost and rarity of certain shades or types of blue, such as sapphire or tanzanite. However, the most expensive color in the literal sense is not blue; it can vary based on market conditions and demand."

Ryan Crouser, with his exceptional strength and athletic prowess, is a formidable athlete in his field. However, a bengal fox is a small wild animal weighing typically between 5 to 15 pounds and standing about 15 to 20 inches tall at the shoulder. Even if we consider the upper limit of his strength, throwing a bengal fox would be far beyond his reach and would be both unethical and illegal. Additionally, the sheer size and agility of a bengal fox make it an impossible target for such a throw."
"Given the context of Lord Voldemort's rule and the strict measures he would likely have implemented at Hogwarts, the answer to the question ""Would Lord Voldemort have been barred from Hogwarts under his own rules?"" is:

(B) Yes

Lord Voldemort, known for his harsh and tyrannical rule, would have set stringent rules to maintain his authority. It is plausible that he could have included a rule that barred him from Hogwarts, as he would have been the ultimate authority and could enforce such a rule to ensure his dominance and control over the school."

"Given the context of the question, it is important to clarify the legal implications of both scenarios.

Michael Vick was convicted of dog fighting and faced a prison sentence of 230 months (over 19 years). This was a significant and lengthy sentence due to the nature of his crimes, which included operating a dog fighting enterprise.

On the other hand, shooting a bald eagle is a federal offense under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The maximum penalty for such an offense is 10 years in prison. However, the actual sentence can vary based on the circumstances of the case, including prior criminal history and the severity of the offense.

Therefore, it is highly improbable that a person would receive a prison sentence of more than 10 years for shooting a bald eagle.

Mahatma Gandhi lived from 1869 to 1948, and television was not invented during his lifetime. The first television broadcast in the United States occurred in 1938, and it was not until the 1950s that television became widely available and popular. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Gandhi, who lived before the advent of television, watched the show Bonanza, which aired from 1959 to 1973."

Mental health disorders are complex and can manifest in various ways, including changes in behavior, mood, and daily functioning. While some individuals might attempt to hide their symptoms, the reality is that many mental health conditions are not easily concealed from others. Symptoms can be observed by friends, family, or colleagues, and in severe cases, even by the person experiencing them. Therefore, it's not feasible to completely hide a mental disorder from others."

"Given the anatomy of a goblin shark, the answer to whether it can hypothetically ride a bike if it had limbs is:

(B) No

Goblin sharks, like all sharks, are cartilaginous fish and do not possess limbs. Their body structure is adapted for swimming, not for standing or riding bicycles. Even if we consider a hypothetical scenario where a goblin shark had limbs, it would still not be able to ride a bike due to the fundamental differences in their body structure and locomotion capabilities."
"Yes, Kurt Cobain's music genre, grunge, survived after his death. Grunge music, known for its raw, emotional sound and often politically charged lyrics, has continued to influence and evolve. Artists like Foo Fighters have built on the grunge foundation, ensuring the genre's relevance and continued presence in the music world."
"A spice grinder is not necessarily useless for the cheapest cinnamon sticks. While the quality of the cinnamon sticks might be lower, a good spice grinder can still help you grind them into a more uniform consistency.

"Given the attributes of Iris and Hermes, we can analyze their suitability for a UPS job. Iris, as the goddess of the rainbow and messenger of the gods, is known for her swift and direct communication, as well as her ability to travel at great speeds. Hermes, the god of trade, commerce, and thievery, is also a messenger of the gods and is associated with cunning, resourcefulness, and speed.

In the context of a UPS job, which involves handling packages, ensuring timely delivery, and managing inventory, Iris would likely excel due to her speed and communication skills. However, Hermes, while also quick and resourceful, might struggle with the more routine and detail-oriented tasks such as inventory management and customer service, which are crucial in a UPS job.

Therefore, while Iris and Hermes would complement each other in terms of speed and communication, Hermes might find the more mundane and repetitive aspects of a UPS job challenging.

The answer is:
(B) No"

Lactic acid is a normal metabolic byproduct that occurs during intense physical activity when the body's demand for energy exceeds the oxygen supply to the muscles. This leads to a buildup of lactic acid, which can cause muscle fatigue and soreness. However, the body has mechanisms to manage and eliminate lactic acid, and it is not inherently harmful in moderate amounts. In fact, lactic acid plays a crucial role in energy production and muscle function. While excessive accumulation can lead to discomfort and fatigue, it is not typically considered bad for the body in general."
"The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was aimed at the English throne and did not specifically target Mary, Queen of Scots or her descendants. Mary, Queen of Scots was executed in 1587, and her bloodline was indeed eliminated through her execution. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Alice from ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" is a fictional character, and as such, she does not exist in the real world. Therefore, she cannot join a Masonic Lodge, which is a real-world organization with specific membership requirements."
"To compare the pain and severity of a bull shark bite versus a crocodile bite, we need to consider several factors, including the bite force and the potential for infection and tissue damage.

Bull sharks are known for their powerful jaws and can deliver significant bite force, which can lead to severe tissue damage and infections. Their bites are often more aggressive and can be more painful due to the powerful muscles in their jaws.

Crocodiles, while also capable of delivering powerful bites, are generally more selective in their prey and are less likely to attack humans unless provoked. However, crocodile bites can still be quite severe and can cause significant pain and tissue damage.

Given these factors, it is challenging to definitively state that one bite is worse than the other. Both can cause severe pain and significant injury. The severity of the injury would depend on the specific circumstances, such as the size of the animal and the individual's response to the bite.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"
"(A) No

In the context of ethical considerations within fictional narratives, Snow White's situation does not exemplify good consent.

"(A) No

Avengers Comics would not be out of place in a DC Comics store. Both Marvel and DC Comics frequently collaborate on crossover events and shared universe stories, making it common for characters from one publisher to appear in the other's publications. This cross-publisher presence ensures that a store specializing in one publisher's comics can still feature a wide variety of content, including Avengers Comics."
"(A) No

Roman numerals cannot fill the normal number of Sudoku box options. The reason is that Sudoku requires a 9x9 grid divided into 9 boxes, each of which is a 3x3 grid, and each box must contain the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once. Roman numerals, however, only use a limited set of symbols (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) and do not include the numbers 0 through 9. Therefore, Roman numerals cannot be used to fill the Sudoku boxes as they do not provide the necessary numerical range and structure required for a valid Sudoku solution."

"To determine if a 500GB USB device is enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to consider the average storage requirement for a single hour of high-quality Netflix content.

1. **Netflix Content Size**: High-quality 1080p video from Netflix typically ranges from 1.5GB to 3GB per hour.

2. **Storage Requirement for 10 Hours**: Taking the average of 2.5GB per hour, 10 hours of video would require:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times 2.5 \text{ GB/hour} = 25 \text{ GB}
   \]

3. **Comparison with USB Capacity**: A 500GB USB device has a storage capacity of 500GB.

Since 25GB is significantly less than the 500GB capacity of the USB device, a 500GB USB device is more than enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day.

Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine if Jon Brower Minnoch could have broken a chair before the Voyager 2 launch, we need to consider the mass of the Voyager 2 spacecraft and Minnoch's physical capabilities.

The Voyager 2 spacecraft had a launch mass of approximately 795 kilograms (1,753 pounds). Jon Brower Minnoch weighed only about 10 pounds at the time of his death in 1983, which is an extremely low weight for a human. Given his severe underweight condition and the significant mass difference between a human and a spacecraft, it is highly improbable that he could have broken a chair, let alone a spacecraft.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"
"Given that hedgehogs are primarily nocturnal and are known for their curious nature, they are more likely to explore and interact with a variety of animals, including those without a spinal cord. While their primary defense mechanism involves their spines, which are not directly related to the presence or absence of a spinal cord, their behavior is more influenced by their curiosity and the need to avoid threats rather than the specific anatomy of the animal.

Therefore, a hedgehog would not avoid animals without a spinal cord. The correct answer is:

In the United States, the education system generally prioritizes core academic subjects such as mathematics, science, language arts, and social studies. While arts education is available and often integrated into the curriculum, it is not typically prioritized as a core subject. This means that while many schools offer art classes and extracurricular activities, they are often considered elective subjects rather than mandatory parts of the core curriculum. However, there is a growing movement to increase the importance of arts education, and some states and districts have implemented policies to ensure more comprehensive arts education. Nonetheless, the current system does not prioritize art as a core subject in the same way as core academic subjects."

There is no substantial historical or textual evidence to support the claim that the story of Jesus was influenced by Egyptian mythology."
"In biblical history, Methuselah is indeed known for his exceptionally long lifespan, living for 969 years. However, this lifespan is rooted in myth and religious tradition rather than historical or scientific fact.

"To determine if King Kong was climbing at a higher altitude than Eiffel Tower visitors, we need to compare their elevations:

1. **King Kong**: In the context of the films, King Kong is often depicted as being very tall. For the purpose of this comparison, let's assume King Kong is at a height of 30 meters (approximately 98 feet) when he climbs.

2. **Eiffel Tower Visitors**: The Eiffel Tower stands at a height of approximately 330 meters (1,083 feet) above sea level. The highest level accessible to visitors is the first level, which is about 57 meters (187 feet) above sea level.

Given these heights:
- King Kong is at 30 meters.
- The highest accessible level for Eiffel Tower visitors is 57 meters.

Since 30 meters is lower than 57 meters, King Kong would be climbing at a lower altitude than what Eiffel Tower visitors can reach.

"To determine if Michael Bloomberg could fund the debt of Micronesia for a decade, we need to consider the scale of both entities' financial capacities.

1. **Michael Bloomberg's Wealth**: As of 2023, Michael Bloomberg's net worth is approximately $10 billion. This is a significant sum, but it pales in comparison to the scale of Micronesian debt and the country's economic size.

2. **Micronesian Debt and Economy**: Micronesia's debt is relatively small compared to its GDP. For instance, in 2021, Micronesia's GDP was around $1.2 billion, and its debt was approximately $100 million. This means that even if Bloomberg were to contribute the full amount of Micronesian debt, it would still be a fraction of the country's GDP.

Given these factors, it is highly unlikely that Michael Bloomberg could fund the debt of Micronesia for a decade with his personal wealth.

An armadillo's shell is indeed a strong and protective feature, but it is not suitable as a shield for a human for several reasons:

1. **Size and Weight**: The shell of an armadillo is relatively small and lightweight, making it impractical to use as a shield for a human body.

2. **Mobility**: Armadillos are not designed to move quickly or maneuver in complex ways, which would make it difficult for a human to use an armadillo as a shield effectively.

3. **Durability**: While the shell is tough, it can be damaged or broken, leaving the user exposed.

4. **Versatility**: A human would need a shield that can be used in various situations, such as in a fight or confrontation. An armadillo's shell is not versatile enough for these purposes.

Therefore, while the armadillo's shell is a strong and protective feature, it is not practical or effective as a shield for a human."

To elaborate as an expert in understanding metaphors and symbolism in the arts, it's important to recognize that while the question of drowning in a Swan Lake performance might seem literal, it often carries deeper symbolic meanings. In the context of the ballet, the Swan Lake performance is a metaphorical journey through themes of transformation, love, and the supernatural. The swans, representing Odette and Odile, symbolize purity and illusion, while the lake itself can be seen as a metaphor for the subconscious or the realm of the supernatural. Thus, the question of drowning in the performance is more about the emotional and symbolic depths of the story rather than a literal occurrence."
"A: (A) No

Furniture is generally made from materials that are robust and suitable for everyday use, such as wood, metal, or plastic.

- **Statue of Liberty**: 93 meters (305 feet)
- **Statue of Unity**: 182 meters (597 feet)
- **Lighthouse of Alexandria**: 130 meters (426 feet)

If we hypothetically place all three structures at the same height, the Statue of Liberty would be the lowest at 93 meters, followed by the Lighthouse of Alexandria at 130 meters, and the Statue of Unity would be the tallest at 182 meters.

Therefore, the Statue of Unity would not be hypothetically more level (at the same height) with the Statue of Liberty than the Lighthouse of Alexandria.

Wool can typically be machine washed, but it's important to handle it with care. Here are some considerations:

1. **Machine Washing**: Use a gentle cycle and a wool or delicates detergent. Avoid fabric softeners, as they can damage the wool fibers.
2. **Hand Washing**: Hand washing is also an option, especially for delicate items or when you want to ensure the garment is treated with extra care. Use a gentle detergent and a basin or sink with enough water to submerge the garment. Gently agitate the wool in the water, then rinse thoroughly.
3. **Drying**: Wool should be air-dried or tumble-dried on a low heat setting. Avoid drying wool in direct sunlight, as it can cause color fading and shrinkage.
4. **Ironing**: Wool can be ironed, but it's best to do so on a low heat setting and using a pressing cloth to protect the fabric.

So, while wool can be machine washed, it's not necessary to hand wash it only. The choice between machine washing and hand washing depends on the specific garment and your preference for care."
"Given the context of Islamic history and theology, it is important to clarify the numbers in question. Reza Shah, the first monarch of Iran, was a Shia Muslim. Shia Islam recognizes 12 Imams, who are considered the spiritual and political leaders of the Shia community. On the other hand, Jesus had 12 apostles, who were his closest followers and disciples.

Comparing these numbers:
- Number of Imams Reza Shah believed in: 12

The first Duke of Valentinois, Cesare Borgia, was born in 1475 and died in 1507. The Hundred Years' War, which lasted from 1337 to 1453, was a series of conflicts between the House of Lancaster in England and the House of Plantagenet in France. Since Cesare Borgia lived long after the end of the Hundred Years' War, he did not play a key role in that conflict."
"Based on my understanding of United States military policies, the United States Military Academy, such as West Point, generally does not outright reject applicants with multiple sclerosis. However, the admissions process is highly competitive and rigorous.

"During the Cuban revolution, the United States did not experience a population boom. The revolution primarily affected Cuban politics and society, and its immediate consequences were felt within Cuba and the broader Latin American region. The population growth in the United States during that period was driven by various domestic factors, including economic prosperity and immigration, rather than events in Cuba. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No"

Sainsbury's and Tesco are both significant players in the UK grocery retail market, but they are not directly related companies. A merger or acquisition of this scale would be highly complex and financially challenging. Sainsbury's, while a major player, does not have the financial resources or strategic interest to acquire Tesco, which is a much larger and more complex entity. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that Sainsbury's would be able to acquire Tesco."

"Given the context of market analysis and feasibility studies, Poland Spring can indeed make money in the Sahara. The Sahara Desert, while challenging, is home to significant water resources, particularly in the form of underground aquifers. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Water Extraction**: Companies can extract water from these aquifers and bottle it for sale. Poland Spring, with its established brand and marketing power, can leverage its reputation to attract customers.

2. **Local Demand**: There is a significant demand for water in the Sahara, especially for local communities, businesses, and travelers. Poland Spring can target these markets effectively.

3. **Infrastructure**: While the environment is harsh, the presence of existing infrastructure, such as pipelines and storage facilities, can facilitate the extraction and distribution of water.

4. **Regulatory Environment**: Understanding and complying with local regulations regarding water extraction and bottling operations is crucial. However, with proper planning and compliance, this can be a viable business model.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) Yes"

"To determine if you can save every HD episode of Game of Thrones on a Samsung Galaxy A10e, we need to consider the storage capacity and the file size of the episodes.

The Samsung Galaxy A10e has 32GB of internal storage. Each HD episode of Game of Thrones, assuming an average length of 1 hour and a resolution of 1080p, would require approximately 1.5GB of storage. 

Given that there are 16 seasons of Game of Thrones, with each season containing around 10-12 episodes, we can estimate the total storage needed. Let's use the higher number of episodes per season for a worst-case scenario:

- Total episodes: 16 seasons * 12 episodes/season = 192 episodes
- Total storage required: 192 episodes * 1.5GB/episode = 288GB

Since the Galaxy A10e has only 32GB of internal storage, it is clear that it does not have enough storage to save every HD episode of Game of Thrones.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"

To elaborate further in my role as an expert on the lives of 20th-century US presidents, it is important to note that the concept of ""lolcats"" did not exist during the presidency of George H. W. Bush. The term ""lolcats"" refers to humorous cat images with text captions, which became popular in the early 2000s. Given the timeline and the historical context, it is highly improbable that the 40th President of the United States would have been involved with or forwarded such content to his friends."
"To address the question of whether the number of states in Ancient Greece was underwhelming compared to the number of states in the United States in 1900, we need to compare the two:

1. **Ancient Greece**: The city-states of Ancient Greece, such as Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes, are often considered to have been independent city-states or poleis. This gives us a total of approximately 13 city-states.

2. **United States in 1900**: By 1900, the United States had 45 states, including the original 13 colonies that formed the United States and the additional states that joined the Union after the American Revolution and the Civil War.

Comparing these numbers:
- Ancient Greece: 13 states
- United States in 1900: 45 states

It is evident that the number of states in the United States in 1900 was significantly larger than the number of states in Ancient Greece.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"During a pandemic, door-to-door advertising can indeed be considered inconsiderate for several reasons:

1. **Health Risks**: Door-to-door canvassing involves close contact with individuals, which can increase the risk of spreading the virus, especially among those at higher risk due to age or pre-existing health conditions.

2. **Social Distancing**: The practice of door-to-door canvassing often involves standing close to people's homes, which goes against the social distancing guidelines recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.

3. **Public Health Concerns**: During a pandemic, public health officials are urging people to stay at home and limit their interactions to reduce the spread of the virus. Door-to-door canvassing can be seen as a disruption to this effort.

4. **Privacy Concerns**: People may feel uncomfortable or annoyed by door-to-door canvassing, especially if they are already dealing with stress and anxiety related to the pandemic.

"To analyze whether Harry Potter or The Matrix was a better investment for Warner Bros., we need to consider several financial metrics such as box office performance, merchandise sales, streaming rights, and overall franchise longevity.

The Harry Potter franchise has grossed over $7.7 billion worldwide, with a significant portion of that coming from the box office. The series has also generated substantial revenue through merchandise, theme parks, and streaming rights. Warner Bros. has continued to invest in the Harry Potter universe, with the release of the latest film in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,"" which was a critical and commercial success.

On the other hand, The Matrix franchise has grossed over $3.7 billion worldwide, with a notable box office performance but less consistent merchandise and streaming rights revenue. However, The Matrix has also seen continued success with the release of ""The Matrix Resurrections,"" which was a critical and commercial success.

Given the financial performance and the long-term potential of both franchises, Warner Bros. likely saw value in both. However, the Harry Potter franchise has shown more consistent and substantial financial returns.

Therefore, the refined answer is:

"In the context of feudal systems, the status of Japanese serfdom compared to English serfdom is not directly comparable. Japanese feudalism, particularly under the Bakufu system, was more about the relationship between samurai and the daimyo, focusing on military service and land grants rather than personal servitude. English serfdom, on the other hand, was characterized by peasants who were bound to the land and required to work on the lord's estate in exchange for protection and basic necessities. 

Given these differences, it is not accurate to say that Japanese serfdom had a higher status than English serfdom. The Japanese system, while involving a form of dependency, was structured differently and did not have the same level of personal servitude as English serfdom.

Therefore, the answer is:

"Given the depth of the Red Sea's deepest point at approximately 4,267 meters (14,000 feet) below sea level, diving to such depths would indeed be extremely challenging and technically demanding. The pressure at this depth is immense, far beyond the limits of a typical human diver without specialized equipment and extensive training.
