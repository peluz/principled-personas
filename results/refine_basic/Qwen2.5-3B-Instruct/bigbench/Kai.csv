"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
9. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
11. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
12. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. So, house 3 is occupied by the person wearing high heels.

Now, let's use Clue 11 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the root beer lover and the person who is eating mangos. Since the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be next to each other.

Given that the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the coffee drinker, and the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3 and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(B) 2**."
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

So, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. The violinist lives in House 1.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 1.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.
4. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
7. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.
8. The violinist lives in the first house.

From these, we can deduce:
- House 1: Violinist (and also the person who ate spaghetti)
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice (and also the history book buff)
- House 2: Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone (since they must be next to each other)

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist and the violinist is in House 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1. This leaves House 2 for the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips must live in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"The person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"The mystery book reader lives in the third house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 3."
"The person who has a computer lives in house 2. So, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house (reaffirmed).
6. **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are in the same house, which contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, Clue 5 must be incorrect, and the root beer lover does not live in the third house. This means the root beer lover must live in one of the other houses.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. So, the tea drinker must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.

Let's place the tea drinker in the first or fourth house. If the tea drinker is in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."

"The person who only drinks water lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."

The correct answer, considering the options provided, is not directly listed. But if we strictly follow the options given:

- (A) 2
- (B) 3

"The bird keeper lives in House 1.

So, the correct answer is (D) 1."
"The soccer player lives in house 1. 

So, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The cat lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives.
8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and is directly left of the person who had fried rice. This means the person who had fried rice lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live next to each other. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must be in the first and second houses. Given that the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house, the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

From Clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had fried rice is in the second house, the person who had stew must be in the fourth or fifth house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the bird keeper must be in the first or second house. But since the person who had pizza is in the second house, the bird keeper must be in the first house.

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the bird keeper is in the first house, the person who has a television must be in the fourth or fifth house. Given that the person who had fried rice is in the second house, the person who has a television must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 9, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the person who had stew must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the person who has a television is in the fourth house, the person who had stew must be in the fifth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with a phone
- House 2: Person with pizza
- House 3: Cat lover
- House 4: Person with a television
- House 5: Person with stew

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Pianist does not live in the first house.**
2. **Person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.**
3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other, and the person eating kiwis to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist next to each other, and the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio next to each other.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, we need to place the person eating oranges directly left of the person with a television.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The correct answer is (A) 8."

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the minivan driver lives in house 4. From Clue 10, the root beer lover lives in house 3. 

From Clue 8, the basketball player lives directly left of the truck driver, so the truck driver must be in house 2 and the basketball player in house 1.

From Clue 3, the swimmer lives directly left of the sedan owner. Since the swimmer is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the truck driver, so the sedan owner must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in house 1, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 3 or 4. But house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, so the bouquet of lilies must be in house 4.

From Clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other. Since the bouquet of lilies is in house 4, the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. Since the coffee drinker cannot be in house 1 (Clue 7) and the tennis player cannot be in house 1 (Clue 6), the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the tennis player in house 3.

From Clue 4, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 4, the truck driver must be in house 3.

So, the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(A) 3**."

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red (in house 2) lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the person who likes white. Since the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house (Clue 2), and the person who likes white is in house 1, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"The person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

So, the correct answer is (A) 3."
"The root beer lover lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"The person who has a computer lives in house 2.

So, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
   - This means the golfer must be in House 2 and the science fiction book fanatic in House 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - This means the pizza-eater and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the golfer is in House 2, the pizza-eater and history book buff must be in House 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means the guitarist and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce:
- House 1: Pizza-eater (PE) and History book buff (HBB)
- House 2: Golfer (G)

Now, considering Clue 3:
- The guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

Given the constraints, the only feasible arrangement is:
- House 1: Pizza-eater (PE) and History book buff (HBB)
- House 2: Golfer (G), Guitarist (Guitarist), Person with bouquet of daffodils (D)

Since the golfer is in House 2 and the guitarist is to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils, the percussionist must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"

"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 3. 

So, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints and the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house. So, the person who likes white lives in one of the first three houses (houses 1, 2, or 3).

2. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist, and there are two houses between them. This means the pianist cannot be in the first house, and the person who likes green cannot be in the first house. Also, the pianist cannot be in the third house, and the person who likes green cannot be in the third house.

3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist. This means the guitarist cannot be in the first house, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies cannot be in the first house.

4. The person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other. This means they cannot be in the first or last house.

5. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza cannot be in the first house, and the person who likes blue cannot be in the first house.

6. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the person who likes white cannot be in the first house, and the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in the fourth house.

7. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the third house. This means the person who has a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in the third house.

8. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who had stew cannot be in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the first house.

9. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who is wearing sandals cannot be in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the first house.

Given these constraints, let's try to place the person who likes white in the first three houses:

- If the person who likes white is in house 1, then the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2 (since the person who likes white is to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes). This would place the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils in house 3 and house 4, respectively, which is not possible since the person who had pizza cannot be in the first house and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils cannot be in the third house.

- If the person who likes white is in house 2, then the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 3. This would place the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils in house 1 and house 4, respectively, which is possible.

- If the person who likes white is in house 3, then the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 4. This would place the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils in house 1 and house 2, respectively, which is possible.

Given the constraints, the most logical placement is that the person who likes white lives in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes white lives is (B) 2."
"The person who only drinks water lives in House 1.

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

From clue 3, the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer. So, the second house is:
- Root beer

From clue 1, the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3. Since the third house is taken by yellow, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is:
- Blue

Since the second house is taken by root beer and the third house is taken by yellow, the person who likes white must be in the first or fourth house.

- White

This leaves the fourth house for the person who likes blue.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes blue lives is 4.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

5. **Clue 4**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

6. **Clue 1**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

7. **Clue 3**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater
- The guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.
- The percussionist and science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

Let's place the known elements:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater

Since the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively, and the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, the only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. The romance book lover lives in the 5th house.
2. The person who owns horses lives in the 2nd house.
3. The fish enthusiast lives in the 3rd house.
4. The person who likes blue and the history book buff live next to each other.
5. The person who likes yellow and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live next to each other.
6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
7. The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
8. The person who likes red and the romance book lover live next to each other.
9. The person who likes white and the person who owns horses live next to each other.
10. The person who has a vase of tulips lives one house to the right of the romance book lover.

Let's start placing the known elements:

- Romance book lover (5th house)
- Fish enthusiast (3rd house)
- Person who owns horses (2nd house)
- Person who likes blue and the history book buff (next to each other, so 1st and 2nd or 2nd and 3rd)

Since the person who owns horses is in the 2nd house, the person who likes blue and the history book buff must be in the 1st and 2nd houses. Since the romance book lover is in the 5th house, the person who likes blue must be in the 2nd house and the history book buff in the 1st house.

- 1st house: History book buff
- 2nd house: Person who likes blue
- 3rd house: Fish enthusiast
- 4th house: ?
- 5th house: Romance book lover

Next, we need to place the remaining elements:

- The person who likes yellow and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are next to each other.
- The person who likes yellow is to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
- The person who likes yellow and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are next to each other, so they must be in the 1st and 2nd houses or 2nd and 3rd houses or 3rd and 4th houses or 4th and 5th houses.

Since the person who likes yellow is to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies, and the person who likes yellow and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are next to each other, the only possible positions are 1st and 2nd houses or 2nd and 3rd houses.

Let's try 1st and 2nd houses:
- 1st house: Person who likes yellow
- 2nd house: Person who has a bouquet of daffodils

This leaves the 3rd house for the fish enthusiast, the 4th house for the person who likes red, and the 5th house for the romance book lover.

Now, we need to place the remaining elements:

- The person who likes red and the romance book lover live next to each other.
- The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives one house to the right of the romance book lover.

Since the romance book lover is in the 5th house, the person who likes red must be in the 4th house. The person who likes red and the romance book lover are next to each other, so the person who likes red is in the 4th house and the romance book lover is in the 5th house.

The person who likes red is in the 4th house, so the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the 5th house, which is already taken by the romance book lover. This means the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the 4th house.

Now, the person who likes red is in the 4th house, and the person who has a rose bouquet is in the 4th house. The person who likes red is in the 4th house, so the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the 4th house.

The person who likes red is in the 4th house, the person who has a rose bouquet is in the 4th house, and the person who likes red and the romance book lover are next to each other, so the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the 4th house.

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the mystery book reader must be in the fourth house, which is a contradiction because the saxophonist and the mystery book reader cannot both be in the same house. Therefore, we need to reassess.

Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the mystery book reader must be in the fifth house. This means the saxophonist and the mystery book reader are not in the same house, and the saxophonist is in the fourth house.

From Clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the romance book lover must be in the third house, and the percussionist must be in the second house.

"The person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

(C) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. The saxophonist lives in the third house (Clue 4).
2. The flutist lives in the second house (Clue 9).
3. The cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other (Clue 3).
4. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who had fried rice (Clue 6).
5. The person who had fried rice lives directly left of the person who had pizza (Clue 6).
6. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist (Clue 10).
7. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist (Clue 10).
8. The person who ate fried rice lives directly left of the person who had pizza (Clue 6).
9. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist (Clue 8).
10. There is one house between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the root beer lover lives (Clue 12).
11. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 13).
12. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red (Clue 14).
13. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker (Clue 15).

From Clue 4, we know the saxophonist is in house 3. From Clue 6, the person who had pizza and the person who had fried rice are next to each other, and the person who had fried rice is to the left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza is in house 2 and the person who had fried rice is in house 1.

From Clue 8, the person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist (house 3). So, the person who likes yellow is in house 2.

From Clue 10, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist. The coffee drinker must be in house 1, and the percussionist must be in house 2.

From Clue 12, there is one house between where the person who likes yellow lives (house 2) and where the root beer lover lives. The root beer lover must be in house 4.

From Clue 13, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. The person who likes milk must be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 5.

From Clue 14, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red. The coffee drinker is in house 1, and the person who likes red must be in house 5.

From Clue 15, the cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. The cellist must be in house 1.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist, Person who had pizza, Person who likes yellow, Coffee drinker
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Person who likes root beer
- House 5: Person who ate grilled cheese, Person who likes milk, Person who had fried rice

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"The person who likes white lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (A) 1.
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"The person who drives a minivan lives in house number 1. 

So, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"The dog owner lives in house 3.

So, the correct answer is (B) 3."
"The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who had pizza:

1. **Carnations in House 1.**
2. **Apples in House 2.**
3. **Banana not between pianist and person eating apples.**
4. **Stew and grilled cheese next to each other.**
5. **Guitarist not in House 3.**
6. **Pizza to the right of saxophonist.**
7. **Piano not in House 5.**
8. **Tulips not in House 3.**
9. **Daffodils next to roses.**
10. **Banana not in House 4.**
11. **Two houses between banana and pianist.**
12. **Pizza to the right of saxophonist.**
13. **Pizza not in House 5.**

Let's start by placing the person who has carnations in House 1. This leaves us with the following:

- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Apples
- House 3: Not daffodils
- House 4: Not daffodils
- House 5: Not daffodils

Since the person who has apples (House 2) lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who had stew and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other, we can deduce the following:

- House 2: Apples
- House 3: Not daffodils
- House 4: Not daffodils
- House 5: Not daffodils

Given that the person who had pizza lives to the right of the saxophonist, and the person who had pizza does not live in House 5, we can place the saxophonist in House 4, and the pizza in House 5.

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The history book buff lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
3. **Clue 12**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
4. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. **Clue 9**: The flutist does not live in the first house.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
11. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who likes green lives.
12. **Clue 11**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.

Let's start by placing the history book buff in the second house:
1. History book buff (2)

Next, we need to place the person who had pizza and the person who ate fried rice. According to Clue 10 and Clue 12, the person who had pizza must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the percussionist must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Also, there is one house between the history book buff and the person who ate spaghetti (Clue 14).

Let's place the person who had pizza in the first house:
1. Pizza (1)
2. History book buff (2)
3. Spaghetti (3)
4. ?

Now, the person who ate fried rice must be in the fourth house:
1. Pizza (1)
2. History book buff (2)
3. Spaghetti (3)
4. Fried rice (4)

Next, we need to place the person who likes blue and the percussionist. According to Clue 6 and Clue 7, the person who likes blue must be to the left of the percussionist, and the person who likes blue must be to the left of the person who had pizza. Since the person who had pizza is in the first house, the person who likes blue must be in the second house, and the percussionist must be in the third house:
1. Pizza (1)
2. Blue (2)
3. Percussionist (3)
4. Fried rice (4)

Now, we need to place the person who likes yellow and the person who has a rose bouquet. According to Clue 1, the person who has a rose bouquet must be directly left of the person who likes yellow. The only remaining house is the fourth, but the person who likes yellow cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 5). Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in the third house, and the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the second house:
1. Pizza (1)
2. Yellow (2)
3. Percussionist (3)
4. Fried rice (4)

Finally, we need to place the person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. According to Clue 5, the person who likes white must be directly left of the person who likes yellow, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice. The only remaining house for the person who likes white is the first house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the third house:
1. White (1)
2. Yellow (2)
3. Daffodils (3)
4. Fried rice (4)

The only house left for the person who likes blue is the second house, and the only house left for the person who had pizza is the first house, which is already occupied. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be in the third house, and the person who had pizza must be in the first house:
1. White (1)
2. Blue (2)
3. Daffodils (3)
4. Fried rice (4)

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the third house, and the cellist (musical instrument) must live in the first house.

The number of the house where the cellist lives is **1**.

So, the correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"The correct option is (A) 3.

To summarize the reasoning:
1. The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
2. The flutist is to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
4. There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.

By analyzing these clues, we deduced that the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, the violinist in house 1, the flutist in house 3, and the person eating grapes in house 1 (which is a contradiction, so it must be house 2). Therefore, the pianist must be in house 3.

So, the pianist lives in house 3."
"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Based on the clues provided, the person who likes red lives in the third house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(D) 3"
"The root beer lover lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"The person who has the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4."
The pianist lives in house 2. So the correct answer is (D) 2.
"The person who ate fried rice lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

So, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"The romance book lover lives in house 2.

So, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who has a phone lives in House 1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"The person who likes yellow lives in house 2. So, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who owns horses lives in the fifth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"The person who drives a truck lives in House 5. 

So, the correct answer is (C) 5."
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

(C) 3"
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"The person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (B) 2."
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"The guitarist lives in house number 3.

So, the correct answer is (C) 3."
"The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza

2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
   - Radio cannot be in house 4.

3. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who is eating a banana step by step:

1. **Pianist and Horse Owner**: The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. **Apples and Kiwis**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Baseball Player and Fried Rice**: The baseball player and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
4. **Apples in Second House**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the second house.
5. **Fried Rice and Oranges**: The person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
6. **Dog Owner and First House**: The dog owner does not live in the first house.
7. **Bird Keeper in Second House**: The bird keeper lives in the second house.
8. **Horse and Grilled Cheese**: The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
9. **Stew and Banana**: The person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
10. **Saxophonist and Grilled Cheese**: The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other.
11. **Tennis Player and Baseball Player**: The tennis player and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
12. **Basketball Player and Cat Lover**: The basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover.
13. **Saxophonist and Golfer**: There is one house between where the saxophonist lives and where the golfer lives.
14. **Mangos and Horse**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
15. **Tennis Player in First House**: The tennis player lives in the first house.
16. **Percussionist in Fourth House**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
17. **Pianist Not in Third House**: The pianist does not live in the third house.
18. **Apples and Golfer**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
19. **Pizza and Fifth House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 15, the tennis player lives in the first house. From clue 16, the percussionist lives in the fourth house. From clue 17, the pianist does not live in the third house. From clue 18, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. From clue 19, the person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

Given that the pianist does not live in the third house, and considering the positions of the other musicians and athletes, the pianist must live in the second house. This leaves the third house for the saxophonist, as the saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other, and the saxophonist and the golfer live one house apart.

The person who is eating a banana must live somewhere to the right of the pianist, and since the pianist lives in the second house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the third, fourth, or fifth house. Given that the percussionist lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating a banana must live in the fifth house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is **5**."
"The person who had pizza lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in house number 3.

So, the correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3**: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4**: The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. **Clue 6**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. **Clue 8**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 10, we know the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses, respectively, or the second and third houses, respectively. However, Clue 9 tells us the fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house and the flutist in the third house.

Now, let's place the fish enthusiast and the person eating a banana. From Clue 5, the fish enthusiast must be to the right of the person eating a banana. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person eating a banana must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: ?
- Third house: Fish enthusiast, Flutist

Next, we place the person wearing running shoes. From Clue 8, the fish enthusiast (third house) lives to the right of the person wearing running shoes. Therefore, the person wearing running shoes must be in the second house.

Now, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Fish enthusiast, Flutist

Since the flutist must be to the right of the fish enthusiast, the flutist must be in the third house, and the fish enthusiast in the second house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person eating a banana
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Fish enthusiast, Flutist

Now, we need to place the pianist, cat lover, and the person who is a cat lover. From Clue 10, the fantasy book enthusiast (first house) lives to the left of the flutist (third house), and the fantasy book enthusiast (first house) lives to the left of the flutist (third house). The cat lover lives in the first house, so the person eating a banana must be the cat lover.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Cat lover (Person eating a banana)
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Fish enthusiast, Flutist

Now, the pianist must be in the second or third house. Since the person wearing running shoes is in the second house, the pianist must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Cat lover (Person eating a banana)
- Second house: Person wearing running shoes
- Third house: Pianist, Flutist

Since the flutist is in the third house, the pianist must be in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Cat lover (Person eating a banana)
- Second house: Pianist
- Third house: Flutist

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4."
"The person who had stew lives in house 1. So, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"The person who likes milk lives in house 3. 

So, the correct answer is (A) 3."
"The person who has a computer lives in House 2.

So, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of the people in the houses:

1. The golfer does not live in the third house.
2. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.
3. The golfer and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

The number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**.
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Swimmer

2. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not apples

3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
   - Possible positions: (1, 3), (2, 4)

4. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not loafers

5. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - Possible positions: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)

6. **Clue 7**: The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - House 1: Phone, House 2: Sandals

7. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
   - House 1: Oranges, House 2: Computer

8. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not lilies

9. **Clue 10**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not loafers

10. **Clue 11**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
    - Possible positions: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)

12. **Clue 12**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
    - Possible positions: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)

From Clue 4, we know the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 7, the phone is in House 1 and the sandals are in House 2. From Clue 8, the person eating oranges is in House 1 and the computer is in House 2.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Computer, Sandals
- **House 3**: Not apples, Not boots, Not lilies, Not bananas, Not gameboy, Not rose bouquet
- **House 4**: Swimmer

From Clue 3, there is one house between boots and kiwis. Since kiwis cannot be in House 3 (Clue 9), kiwis must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 is occupied by oranges. So, kiwis must be in House 2, and boots must be in House 3.

Now, we have:
- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Computer, Sandals
- **House 3**: Boots, Not kiwis
- **House 4**: Swimmer

From Clue 6, the vase of tulips must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 is occupied by phone and oranges, the vase of tulips must be in House 2. This leaves the cricketer in House 3.

From Clue 11, the rose bouquet must be in House 3, and the banana must be in House 4. This leaves the gameboy in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges, Gameboy
- **House 2**: Computer, Sandals, Vase of Tulips, Cricketer
- **House 3**: Boots, Banana, Rose Bouquet, Cricketer
- **House 4**: Swimmer, Banana, Gameboy, Cricketer

The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house (Clue 5). Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers must live in House 1.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is **1**.

**Final Answer: (A) 1**"
The bird keeper lives in house 4. So the correct answer is (B) 4.
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the only possible adjacent houses are the second and third houses.

From Clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in the third house, and the history book buff must live in the second house.

This leaves the romance book lover to live in the first house, but we already know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

Thus, the romance book lover must live in the third house.

So, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."
"The coffee drinker lives in house number 2. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(D) 2"
"The person who is eating a banana lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"The correct option is (C) 1.

To elaborate on the reasoning without referencing the previous response:

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. Clue 6 tells us the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the flutist must be in house 1 and the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2.
2. Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck must be in house 3.
3. Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. Since the truck is in house 3, the gameboy must be in house 2.
4. Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 3.
5. Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person with the television must be in house 1 and the person with high heels must be in house 2.
6. Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 1."
"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their belongings:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house (house 5).
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (house 2).
3. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist, so the pianist must be in house 3.
4. **Clue 13**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils (house 2) lives directly left of the person who has a television (house 3).
5. **Clue 8**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
6. **Clue 7**: The person who has a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
8. **Clue 3**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
9. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
10. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 12**: The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.
12. **Clue 1**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pianist
- House 5: Grapes

Since the person who is eating grapes lives in house 5, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since they live directly left of the saxophonist, and the saxophonist must be in house 3).

Now, we need to place the remaining people:
- House 1: Violinist (since the violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other, and the violinist must be in house 1).
- House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pianist
- House 5: Grapes

The remaining person (the person who is eating mangos) must be in house 1 (since the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the violinist, and the violinist is in house 1).

So, the person who is eating apples must be in house 3, which is the house with the television.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

The number of the house where the romance book lover lives is (B) 2.
"The person wearing boots lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

From Clue 11, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house. From Clue 14, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover. From Clue 10, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.

Given these constraints, let's place the people:

- The person who has a vase of tulips (first house) cannot have a rose bouquet (Clue 14).
- The person who has a rose bouquet must be in the third or fourth house (Clue 10).
- The person who has a rose bouquet cannot be in the second house (Clue 14).
- The person who has a rose bouquet must be to the right of the person who owns a sedan (Clue 10).

"Given the clues, let's break it down:

1. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The violinist lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the violinist lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: ?

From Clue 3, the violinist lives in the second house, so the violinist is in House 2.

From Clue 1, the cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer cannot be in House 3, because the cellist would then be in House 3, which would make the cellist to the left of the cricketer. Therefore, the cricketer must be in House 1, and the cellist must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player lives in the second house, the basketball player is in House 2. This leaves the soccer player to live in House 1 or House 3. But we already know the cricketer lives in House 1 and the cellist lives in House 3.

Therefore, the soccer player must live in House 1.

The number of the house where the soccer player lives is **(A) 1**."

7. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
8. The dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.
9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
10. The person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
11. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.

From clue 11, we know the person who owns horses lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns horses.

From clue 2, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house, which is consistent with clue 11.

From clue 3, the flutist lives in the fourth house, which is consistent with clue 2.

From clue 4, the tennis player does not live in the fourth house. So, the tennis player must live in one of the other houses (1, 2, or 3).

From clue 5, the guitarist does not live in the third house. So, the guitarist must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 6, the violinist does not live in the third house. So, the violinist must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 7, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must live in the first or second house, and the guitarist must live in the third or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the guitarist must live in the third house. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the first or second house.

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live directly next to each other. This means they must be in adjacent houses.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player must live in the first or second house, and the fish enthusiast must live in the third or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live directly next to each other. This means they must be in adjacent houses.

Given all these constraints, let's summarize:
- Fourth house: Person who owns horses (clue 11)
- Third house: Guitarist (clue 7)
- Second house: Cricketer (clue 7)
- First house: Tennis player (clue 4)
- First or second house: Fish enthusiast (clue 9)
- First or second house: Basketball player (clue 9)
- First or second house: Root beer lover (clue 8)
- First or second house: Person who only drinks water (clue 10)

Since the fish enthusiast must live somewhere to the right of the basketball player, and the basketball player must be in the first or second house, the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.

1. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house (house 4).
2. The person who is wearing boots lives in the second house (house 2).
3. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3 or 4. Since the person who had pizza is in house 4, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 3.
4. The person who had stew does not live in the second house (house 2), so the person who had stew must be in house 1, 3, or 5.
5. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels, so the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 1 or 2, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3, 4, or 5.
6. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes, so if the person with carnations is in house \(i\), the person with running shoes is in house \(i+1\).
7. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the first house (house 1).
8. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, so if the person who had pizza is in house 4, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 5.
9. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
10. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
11. The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.

- House 2: Boots (person with boots)
- House 3: Television (person with television)
- House 4: Pizza (person who had pizza)

Michael Vick was convicted of dog fighting and faced a significant prison sentence. The specific sentence he received was 230 months (over 19 years) in prison. This was a substantial punishment for his crimes.

"The question about the status of Japanese serfdom compared to English serfdom is nuanced. In Japan, the feudal system was centered around the samurai class, who were warriors and not necessarily tied to the land in the same way as serfs in medieval England. The Japanese feudal system was more about military service and land grants, rather than a system of personal servitude.

In England, serfdom was a system where peasants were bound to the land and had limited rights. They were often required to work on the lord's land in exchange for protection and basic necessities. The status of serfs in England was generally lower than that of the nobility but higher than that of free peasants.

Given these differences, it would be inaccurate to say that Japanese serfdom had a higher status than English serfdom. The Japanese feudal system, while involving a form of dependency, was structured differently and did not have the same level of personal servitude as English serfdom.
