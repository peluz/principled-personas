"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

We know:
1. The flutist lives in house number 2.
2. The person with the vase of tulips lives next to the guitarist.
3. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives next to the person with the carnations.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

Let's start by placing the flutist in house number 2.

- Flutist: House 2

Now, the pianist must be in either house 3 or house 4 because there is one house between the flutist and the pianist.

- If pianist is in house 3:
  - Guitarist must be in house 2 (but house 2 is already taken by the flutist).
  - This doesn't work.

So, the pianist must be in house 4.

- Pianist: House 4

Now, the guitarist must be in house 3.

- Guitarist: House 3

This leaves house 1 for the person with the bouquet of lilies and house 4 for the person with the carnations.

- Bouquet of lilies: House 1
- Carnations: House 4

Since the person with the vase of tulips must be next to the guitarist (house 3), the vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the cellist lives.

We have three houses, and we need to place people with different characteristics in each house. Here are the clues again:

1. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
2. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
3. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
4. There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
5. The person who likes green lives in the first house.
6. The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. The percussionist does not live in the second house.
8. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

Let's start with what we know:

- The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
- The person who likes green lives in the first house.
- So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis.

Now, let's look at the second house:

- The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
- The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

Since the first house is taken by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis, the second house must be taken by the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy. They must be next to each other, so the person who likes blue is in the second house and the person who has a gameboy is in the third house.

Now, let's place the person who only drinks water and the root beer lover:

- The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
- The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

Since the second house is taken by the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy, the root beer lover and the person who only drinks water must be in the third house. This means the person who is eating grapes must be in the first house, but we already know the first house is taken by the person who likes green and is eating kiwis.

So, the only place left for the person who is eating grapes is the third house. This means the person who is eating grapes is in the third house.

Now, we know:
- First house: Green (person who likes green)
- Second house: Blue (person who likes blue) and Gameboy (person who has a gameboy)
- Third house: Root beer (person who drinks root beer) and Kiwis (person who eats kiwis)

The cellist must live in the third house because there is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives, and the person who has a gameboy is in the third house.

So, the cellist lives in the third house.

The number of the house where the cellist lives is **(C) 3**."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the tea drinker lives.

We have 4 houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:

1. The person in house 3 is wearing high heels.
2. The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live next to each other.
3. The person who is eating apples lives in house 1.
4. The person who is eating grapes lives next to the coffee drinker.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who drives a truck lives next to the person who ate fried rice.
7. The person who drives a truck lives next to the tea drinker.
8. The person who drives a truck lives next to the tea drinker.
9. The person who drives a truck lives next to the tea drinker.
10. The person who had pizza lives next to the coffee drinker.
11. The root beer lover lives next to the person who is wearing running shoes.
12. The person who is wearing high heels lives in house 3.

From clue 3, we know the person in house 3 is wearing high heels. So, house 3 is occupied by the person wearing high heels.

Now, let's use clue 2. The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live next to each other. Since house 3 is taken by the person wearing high heels, the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 4, the person who is eating grapes lives next to the coffee drinker. This means the coffee drinker and the person who is eating grapes must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 6, the person who drives a truck lives next to the person who ate fried rice. This means the person who ate fried rice and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 7, the person who drives a truck lives next to the tea drinker. This means the person who drives a truck and the tea drinker must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 8, the person who drives a truck lives next to the tea drinker. This means the person who drives a truck and the tea drinker must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 9, the person who drives a truck lives next to the tea drinker. This means the person who drives a truck and the tea drinker must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 10, the person who had pizza lives next to the coffee drinker. This means the person who had pizza and the coffee drinker must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 11, the root beer lover lives next to the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the root beer lover and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 12, the root beer lover lives next to the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the root beer lover and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in houses 1 and 2.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Person who is eating apples
- House 2: Person who is eating mangos
- House 3: Person who is wearing high heels
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

The tea drinker must be in house 4 because the person who drives a truck lives next to the tea drinker, and the person who drives a truck is in house 2 or 3. Since house 3 is taken by the person wearing high heels, the tea drinker must be in house 4.

So, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(C) 4**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house. So, the fifth house is taken by the person who only drinks water.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house. So, the third house is taken by the person who ate spaghetti.

From clue 7, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other. Since the fifth house is taken by the person who only drinks water, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in houses 1 and 2.

From clue 3, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew. So, if the person who had stew is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2. If the person who had stew is in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 1.

From clue 5, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Person who only drinks water

Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house, the answer is:

(A) 5"
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives.

1. **Clue 1**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the soccer player and the person eating oranges can't be in houses 1 and 3, but they must be in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges.

Now, let's use these clues to figure out the arrangement:

- From Clue 1, the soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2.
- From Clue 4, the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges. Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person with daffodils must be in house 2.

So, the person with daffodils is in house 2.

Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

1. We know the violinist lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so they must be in either House 1 or House 3.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house (House 3).
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
5. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
6. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.
7. The violinist lives in the first house (House 1).
8. The history book buff lives in the third house (House 3).

From these clues, we can deduce the following:
- The violinist is in House 1.
- The person who ate spaghetti is not in House 2, so they must be in House 1 or House 3.
- The person who ate fried rice is in House 3.
- The history book buff is in House 3.
- The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone must be next to each other.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the percussionist.

Since the history book buff is in House 3, the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone must be in Houses 1 and 2. The person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 because it's to the left of the percussionist, and the percussionist can't be in House 1 (where the violinist is) or House 3 (where the history book buff is). So, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the gameboy lives.

1. We know the mystery book reader lives in the second house.

4. The history book buff lives next to the person with the bouquet of lilies.
5. The percussionist lives next to the person with the computer.
6. The fish enthusiast isn't in the first house.
7. The person with the gameboy is next to the person with the rose bouquet.
8. The cellist isn't in the third house.

Let's start by placing the mystery book reader in the second house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: ?

Since the bird keeper can't be in the first or third house, and the fish enthusiast can't be in the first house, the bird keeper must be in the third house and the fish enthusiast must be in the first house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, the history book buff must be next to the person with the bouquet of lilies. Since the history book buff is in the second house, the bouquet of lilies must be in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

The percussionist must be next to the person with the computer. Since the percussionist is in the second house, the computer must be in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, the gameboy must be next to the person with the rose bouquet. Since the gameboy is in the second house, the rose bouquet must be in the third house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

This means the gameboy is in the second house.

So, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 2.

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing sandals lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means if the history book buff is in house 1, the convertible driver must be in house 2.
   - If the history book buff is in house 2, the convertible driver must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person wearing boots must live in house 2.

Now, let's use these clues:

- Since the person wearing boots lives in house 2, the person driving a convertible must live in house 1 (because the convertible driver must be directly left of the history book buff, and the history book buff cannot be in house 1).
- Therefore, the person driving a truck must live in house 2 (since the person driving a truck is the only other car type left).

So, we have:
- House 1: Convertible driver (wearing sandals)
- House 2: Truck driver (wearing boots)

The person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the basketball player lives.

1. The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff lives in House 4 and the mystery book reader lives in House 3.
   - House 3: Mystery book reader
   - House 4: History book buff

4. The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - Since the mystery book reader is in House 3, the swimmer cannot be in House 3.
   - The swimmer must be in House 2.

5. The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

Now we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Swimmer
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 2, and the only person left is the basketball player.

So, the basketball player lives in House 2.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the mystery book reader lives.

We know:
1. The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
2. The person wearing high heels does not live in the second or fourth house.
3. The history book buff lives to the right of the person wearing loafers.
4. The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. The person wearing sandals lives next to the romance book lover.

Let's place the people based on these clues:

- The third house is for the mystery book reader.
- The person wearing high heels can't be in the second or fourth house, so they must be in the first house.
- The person wearing loafers can't be in the fourth house, so they must be in the second house.
- The person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be next to each other. Since the first and second houses are taken, they must be in the third and fourth houses.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person wearing high heels
- Second house: Person wearing loafers
- Third house: Mystery book reader
- Fourth house: Person wearing sandals

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out which house the person with the computer lives in.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person with a different device and a different favorite color. The clues are:
1. The person who likes green lives next to the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives next to the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow doesn't live in the second house.

Let's start by considering the possible positions for the person who likes yellow. They can't be in the second house, so they must be in either the first or the third house.

### Case 1: The person who likes yellow is in the first house.
- If the person who likes yellow is in the first house, then the person who has a gameboy must be in the second house (because they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in the third house (because they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).
- But this doesn't work because the person who has a gameboy (in the second house) is next to the person who has a computer, and the person who has a computer can't be in the second house (because the second house is already taken by the gameboy person).

### Case 2: The person who likes yellow is in the third house.
- If the person who likes yellow is in the third house, then the person who has a gameboy must be in the second house (because they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in the first house (because they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).
- Now, the person who has a computer must be in the second house (because they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement works because:
- The person who likes green (in the first house) is next to the person who has a gameboy (in the second house).
- The person who has a gameboy (in the second house) is next to the person who has a computer (in the second house).
- The person who likes yellow (in the third house) is not in the second house.

So, the person who has a computer lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

1. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
2. The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
3. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
5. The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
6. The person who likes white lives two houses away from the coffee drinker.
7. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
8. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are in the same house, which contradicts clue 5. Therefore, clue 5 must be incorrect, and the root beer lover does not live in the third house. This means the root beer lover must live in one of the other houses.

From clue 6, the mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
From clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.

Let's place the tea drinker. From clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. So, the tea drinker must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.

If the tea drinker lives in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the cat lover lives.

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
3. The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
4. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. So, house 1 has:
- Fantasy book enthusiast
- Person who likes green
- Person who had pizza

From clue 3, the fish enthusiast lives in house 2. So, house 2 has:
- Fish enthusiast
- Person who has a radio
- Person who ate spaghetti

From clue 4, the person who had pizza does not live in house 1, so the person who had pizza must live in house 2. This means the person who had pizza is the person who ate spaghetti.

Now, we know the person who has a radio must be in house 1 because the person who likes green is directly left of the person who has a radio. So, the person who has a radio is the person who likes green.

This leaves the person who is a cat lover to live in house 1.

So, the number of the house where the cat lover lives is **1**."

- House 4: ?
- House 5: ?

- House 3: Spaghetti
- House 4: Red
- House 5: ?

From clue 5, the flutist lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the flutist.

From clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other. Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 11, the person eating oranges doesn't live in the second house. So, the person eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

From clue 13, the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the flutist, the cat lover must be in a different house.

Let's summarize the constraints:
- House 1: Flutist
- House 2: Person drinking water
- House 3: Person eating oranges
- House 4: Person drinking root beer

From clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the flutist is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 11, the person eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4. Since the person eating oranges can't be in the second house, the person eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who had stew lives.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We also know what each person is eating and what flowers they have in their foyer. Let's look at the clues again:

1. The person with a rose bouquet lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
2. The person who eats oranges lives next to the person who eats apples.
3. The person with a vase of tulips doesn't live in house 5.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who had stew live next to each other.
5. The person with daffodils doesn't live in house 5.
6. The person who had pizza lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a vase of tulips live next to each other.
9. There are two houses between where the person who eats oranges lives and where the person who eats kiwis lives.
10. The person who eats oranges lives next to the person who has carnations.
11. The person who eats apples lives next to the person who eats mangos.

Now, let's try to figure out the arrangement:

- From clue 6 and clue 4, grilled cheese and pizza must be next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- From clue 8 and clue 4, grilled cheese and tulips must be next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- From clue 7 and clue 4, grilled cheese and spaghetti must be next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- From clue 4, grilled cheese and stew must be next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.

Since grilled cheese and pizza, grilled cheese and tulips, grilled cheese and spaghetti, and grilled cheese and stew all must be next to each other, the only possible arrangement is that grilled cheese is in house 1, pizza is in house 2, stew is in house 3, and tulips are in house 4. This leaves house 5 for the person with daffodils.

Now, let's check the other clues:

- Oranges and apples must be next to each other. They can't be in house 5, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. But since grilled cheese is in house 1, oranges and apples can't be in house 1. So, they must be in houses 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- Oranges and kiwis must be two houses apart. So, they can be in houses 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.
- Oranges and carnations must be next to each other. They can't be in house 5, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. But since grilled cheese is in house 1, oranges and carnations can't be in house 1. So, they must be in houses 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.
- Apples and mangos must be next to each other. They can't be in house 5, so they must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. But since grilled cheese is in house 1, apples and mangos can't be in house 1. So, they must be in houses 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5.

After checking all the clues, the only arrangement that fits all of them is:

- House 1: Grilled cheese
- House 2: Pizza
- House 3: Stew
- House 4: Tulips
- House 5: Daffodils

So, the person who had stew lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the fish enthusiast lives.

1. The cat lover lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the cat lover.
2. The tulip owner lives next to the dog owner. This means if the dog owner is in house 5, the tulip owner must be in house 4.
3. The daffodils owner doesn't live in the second house. So, the daffodils owner must live in either house 3 or house 4.
4. The lilies owner lives to the right of the horse owner. This means the horse owner can't be in house 4 (where the tulip owner lives), so the horse owner must be in house 3.
5. The horse owner is in house 3, so the lilies owner must be in house 4 (since the lilies owner lives to the right of the horse owner).
6. The tulip owner is in house 4, so the dog owner must be in house 5.
7. The daffodils owner can't be in house 2, so the daffodils owner must be in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Daffodils
- House 3: Horse
- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Dog

The only house left for the fish enthusiast is house 2.

So, the fish enthusiast lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing high heels lives.

1. The person with a phone lives in the first house.
   - So, the person in house 1 has a phone.

2. The person wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 does not wear boots.

3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other.
   - This means they must be in houses 1 and 2 because they can't be in the same house.

From clue 1, we know the person in house 1 has a phone. So, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots (since the person in house 2 does not wear boots).

Now, clue 3 tells us that the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since the person in house 1 has a phone, the person in house 1 must be the one who owns horses (because the person in house 1 cannot have a phone).

So, the person in house 1 owns horses and has a radio. This means the person in house 2 must have a radio and wear boots.

Since the person in house 1 owns horses and has a radio, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots and have a phone. This leaves the person in house 1 to be wearing high heels.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Grilled Cheese and Computer**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other.
2. **Grilled Cheese in Third House**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
3. **Apples in First House**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the first house.
4. **Apples and Boots**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
5. **Blue and Phone**: There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives.
6. **Loafers and Computer**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house, and the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live next to each other.
7. **Pizza in Second House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.
8. **Mangos and Yellow**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
9. **Computer and Phone**: The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
10. **Grilled Cheese and Computer**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live next to each other.

Let's start by placing the person who had pizza. Since they do not live in the second house, they must live in the first or third house.

- If the person who had pizza lives in the first house, then the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house (since grilled cheese and computer live next to each other and grilled cheese cannot be in the third house).
- If the person who had pizza lives in the third house, then the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house (again, grilled cheese cannot be in the third house).

Let's assume the person who had pizza lives in the first house. Then:
- Grilled cheese lives in the second house.
- Computer lives in the first house (since grilled cheese and computer are next to each other).

Now, the person who ate grilled cheese (in the second house) and the person who has a computer (in the first house) are next to each other, so the person who has a computer must be the one who likes blue (since there is one house between the person who likes blue and the person who has a phone).

So, the first house (pizza) is empty, the second house (grilled cheese) has a computer, and the third house (loafers) has a phone.

Now, the person who likes blue must live in the first house, and the person who has a phone must live in the third house. This leaves the person who likes yellow to live in the second house.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in the second house.

The number of the house where the person who likes green lives is **1**.

So, the correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the bird keeper lives.

We have 4 houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We also know the sports and pets each person has, and there are some clues to help us figure out the arrangement.

1. The baseball player lives in the second house.
2. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Let's use these clues to figure out the arrangement:

- House 2: Baseball player (from clue 2)
- House 1: Not basketball player (from clue 1)
- House 3: Not basketball player and not swimmer (from clue 2 and 3)
- House 4: Cat lover (from clue 6)

Now, let's place the other people:

- House 1: Not basketball player, not swimmer, not bird keeper (from clues 1, 2, and 5)
- House 3: Not basketball player, not swimmer, not bird keeper (from clues 1, 2, and 5)
- House 4: Cat lover (from clue 6)

Since the baseball player is in House 2, the only person left for House 1 is the bird keeper (from clue 5 and 7).

So, the bird keeper lives in House 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the soccer player lives.

We have three houses, and each house has a person with a different characteristic. Here are the clues again:

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
2. There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
5. The violinist does not live in the first house.
6. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start by placing the baseball player and the person who likes blue. From clue 2, the baseball player is in house 2 and the person who likes blue is in house 3.

Now, let's place the sedan and SUV. From clue 3, the sedan and SUV must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But house 2 is already taken by the baseball player, so the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 3. This means house 3 is already taken by the person who likes blue.

So, house 1 has the computer owner, house 2 has the sedan owner, and house 3 has the person who likes blue.

Next, we need to place the violinist. From clue 5, the violinist cannot be in house 1. So, the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. But house 2 is already taken by the sedan owner, so the violinist must be in house 3. This means house 3 is now taken by the person who likes blue and the violinist.

Now, we need to place the guitarist. From clue 7, the guitarist must be to the right of the person who likes white. The person who likes white must be in house 1 or 2. But house 2 is already taken by the sedan owner, so the person who likes white must be in house 1. This means the guitarist must be in house 3.

Finally, we need to place the soccer player. The only house left is house 1, and the person who likes white is in house 1. So, the soccer player must be in house 1.

Therefore, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

(A) 1"
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the television lives.

1. The pianist does not live in the first house.

5. The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
6. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.
7. The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, let's place the remaining people:

- **Person eating oranges (O)** and **Person eating kiwis (K)** are next to each other.
- **Person eating kiwis (K)** is to the left of **Person wearing boots (B)**.
- **Person wearing high heels (H)** and **Person with a radio (R)** are next to each other.
- **Person eating oranges (O)** is directly left of **Person with a television (T)**.

Let's try placing the remaining people:

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, let's check if this arrangement satisfies all the clues:

1. The pianist (P) is in house 1.
2. The person eating oranges (O) is in house 4, and the person eating kiwis (K) is in house 5, so oranges is to the right of kiwis.
3. The person wearing high heels (H) is in house 2, and the pianist (P) is in house 1, so they are next to each other.
4. The person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live next to each other, but we don't have information about running shoes or percussionist yet.
5. The person eating kiwis (K) is in house 5, and the person wearing boots (B) is in house 6, so kiwis is to the left of boots.
6. The person wearing high heels (H) is in house 2, and the person with a radio (R) is in house 7, so they are next to each other.
7. The person eating oranges (O) is in house 4, and the person with a television (T) is in house 8, so oranges is directly left of television.

All the clues are satisfied with this arrangement. Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The answer is (A) 8."
"Let's go through the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns a sedan lives.

1. The tea drinker does not live in the first house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.
3. The person who likes red does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
5. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
6. There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

12. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.
13. The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes milk lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the milk drinker.

From clue 2, the person who is eating apples also lives in the third house. This contradicts clue 7, so there must be a mistake. Let's assume the person who is eating apples lives in the second house instead.

Now, let's place the milk drinker in the third house and the person who is eating apples in the second house.

From clue 1, the tea drinker does not live in the first house. So, the tea drinker can live in the first, fourth, or fifth house.

From clue 4, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the milk drinker is in the third house and the person who is eating a banana is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the second house and the person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house.

From clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the fourth house, the root beer lover and the person who is eating kiwis must be in the first and fifth houses. Since the person who likes milk is in the third house, the root beer lover must be in the first house and the person who is eating kiwis must be in the fifth house.

From clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth (fifth house).

From clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes red must be to the left of the person who only drinks water, and the person who likes red is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must be in the second house.

From clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red is in the first house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the first house.

From clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who likes blue is in the first house and the person who drives a truck is in the fifth house, the person who likes blue must be in the first house and the person who drives a truck must be in the fifth house.

From clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who is eating mangos is in the second house and the person who likes green is in the fifth house, the person who is eating mangos must be in the second house and the person who likes green must be in the fifth house.

From clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow is in the fourth house and the person who owns a sedan must be in the fifth house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the fifth house.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the fifth house.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation:

1. We know the person eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The person eating bananas lives in the third house because the person eating bananas can't be in the second house.
3. This means the person eating mangos must be in the second house.
4. The person driving a truck can't be in the first or third house, so they must be in the second house.
5. The person driving a truck is in the second house, so the person driving a truck can't be in the first house either.
6. The person driving a truck is in the second house, and the person eating mangos is also in the second house, so the person driving a truck must be the one eating kiwis.
7. This leaves the first house for the person who owns an SUV.

So, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and we know some things about the people who live in them:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who ate fried rice.
3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
4. The cricketer doesn't live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the third house is occupied by the fried rice eater.

From clue 2, the spaghetti eater must be in the second house because they live next to the fried rice eater.

From clue 3, the first house is occupied by the swimmer.

So, the only house left for the cricketer is the second house.

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

Now, let's place the known elements:

- House 5: Blue
- House 4: White
- House 1: SUV (since it cannot be in the first house)
- House 2: Running shoes (since it cannot be in the first house and there are two houses between sedan and running shoes)
- House 3: Green (since it cannot be in the first house and there is one house between green and truck)

So, we have:
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue

Next, we need to place the truck and sandals:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Since the truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in a house to the right of the truck, we can place:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Finally, we need to place the truck and sandals:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

Since the truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and the person who is wearing sandals must be in a house to the right of the truck, we can place:

- House 3: Green
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue
- House 1: SUV
- House 2: Running shoes

4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house, which matches the person who had pizza.

So, the history book buff lives in house number 1.

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing running shoes lives.

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house. So, the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 1.
2. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house. So, the person who owns a sedan can live in houses 1, 2, 4, or 5.
3. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. This means the minivan driver and the high heels wearer must be next to each other.
4. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible. This means the sandals wearer and the convertible driver must be next to each other.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other. This means the running shoes wearer and the boots wearer must be next to each other.
6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. So, the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 4.

Now, let's use these clues to figure out the rest:

- The person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.
- The person who is wearing boots must live next to the person wearing running shoes, so the boots wearer lives in house 2.
- The person who is wearing sandals must live next to the person who drives a convertible, so the sandals wearer lives in house 3.
- The person who drives a minivan must live next to the person who is wearing high heels, so the minivan driver lives in house 5.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Running shoes
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: SUV
- House 5: High heels, Convertible

Therefore, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house number 1.

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the basketball player lives.

1. The cricketer lives in the first house. So, house 1 is the cricketer.
2. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. This means the sedan owner and the cat lover are not next to each other.
3. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. This means the sedan owner and the horse owner are next to each other.
4. The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player and the truck driver are not next to each other.

Let's place the people in the houses:

- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: (Sedan owner, Cat lover, Horse owner, Truck driver)
- House 3: (Sedan owner, Cat lover, Horse owner, Truck driver)

Since the cricketer is in house 1, the sedan owner and the horse owner must be in houses 2 and 3. Also, the cat lover must be next to the sedan owner or the horse owner.

If we put the sedan owner in house 2, then the horse owner must be in house 3 (because the horse owner and the sedan owner must be next to each other). This leaves the cat lover to be in house 2, but that would mean the cat lover and the sedan owner are next to each other, which is not allowed. So, the sedan owner must be in house 3, and the horse owner must be in house 2.

This leaves the cat lover to be in house 1, but that would mean the cat lover and the cricketer are next to each other, which is not allowed. So, the cat lover must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Sedan owner

Since the truck driver lives in house 3, the basketball player must live in house 2.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person with the vase of tulips lives in.

1. We know the radio is in the 4th house.
2. The bouquet of daffodils is in the 2nd house.
3. The fish enthusiast is in the 1st house.
4. The percussionist is in the 3rd house.
5. The pianoist is in the 4th house.
6. The guitarist is in the 5th house.

Now, let's look at the clues that help us place the vase of tulips:

- The vase of tulips is somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
- The saxophonist can't be in the 1st house (because the fish enthusiast is there) or the 2nd house (because the bouquet of daffodils is there).
- The saxophonist can be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th house.

Since the saxophonist can't be in the 1st or 2nd house, and the pianoist is in the 4th house, the saxophonist must be in the 3rd house.
- So, the saxophonist is in the 3rd house.
- The vase of tulips must be in the 4th, 5th, or 6th house, but since the pianoist is in the 4th house, the vase of tulips must be in the 5th house.

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in the 5th house.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler clues:

- House 3: Milk drinker (Clue 1)
- House 2: Running shoes (Clue 2)
- House 1: Root beer drinker (Clue 4 and Clue 5)
- House 4: Fried rice eater (Clue 4 and Clue 5)

Since the root beer drinker and the fried rice eater are next to each other (Clue 4), and the root beer drinker is in House 1, the fried rice eater must be in House 2. But we already know House 2 has running shoes, so the fried rice eater must be in House 3.

- House 1: Root beer drinker
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Fried rice eater
- House 4: SUV owner (Clue 5)

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the high heels wearer must be in House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Fried rice eater
- House 4: SUV owner

The person who is wearing loafers lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 7). The only place left for the loafers is House 2, and the grilled cheese eater must be in House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Grilled cheese eater
- House 4: SUV owner

Now, the only person left is the person who owns a sedan. Since there are two houses between where the sedan owner lives and where the person who only drinks water lives, and the only house left is House 4, the sedan owner must be in House 4.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the cellist lives.

We have 4 houses, and each house has a different person living in it. Here are the clues again:

8. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
9. The flutist does not live in the fourth house.
10. The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.

From clue 10, we know the tea drinker lives in house 4. From clue 3, the saxophonist lives in house 2. From clue 8, the pizza eater lives in house 3 (since the pizza eater is to the right of the saxophonist, who is in house 2).

Now, clue 4 tells us the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the pizza eater is in house 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1 (because the pizza eater is to the right of the running shoes person).

Clue 2 tells us the person who had pizza (in house 3) lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes (in house 1). This is correct because house 3 is to the right of house 1.

Clue 5 tells us the cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in house 4, the cellist must be in house 3 (because house 3 is directly left of house 4).

Clue 6 tells us the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 2 (because house 2 is directly left of house 3).

Clue 7 tells us the cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 4 (because house 4 is directly right of house 3).

So, the cellist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.

- **House 3 (Root beer lover):** Root beer lover.
- **House 2 (Swimmer):** The swimmer must be to the left of the sedan owner, and the sedan owner must be to the left of the truck driver. Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 2.

   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.

3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. So, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

Now, we know:

- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

- House 3: The mystery book reader

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

But we already know house 2 is taken by the mystery book reader, so this clue is a bit confusing. Let's move on.
- Clue 3 tells us the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV. Since the SUV owner is in house 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 2.

But we already know house 3 is taken by the SUV owner, so this clue is also confusing. Let's move on.
- Clue 8 tells us the bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the bird keeper is in house 3, the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in house 2. But we already know house 2 is taken by the mystery book reader, so this clue is also confusing.

- Clue 9 tells us the person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other. Since the person who drives a minivan is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1. But we already know house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible, so this clue is also confusing. Let's move on.
- Clue 10 tells us the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1, the romance book lover must be in house 4. But we already know house 4 is taken by the person who is eating grapes, so this clue is also confusing. Let's move on.
- Clue 11 tells us the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes. Since the person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 2, the person who is eating grapes must be in house 4. But we already know house 4 is taken by the person who is eating grapes, so this clue is also confusing. Let's move on.

From all these clues, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Person who drives a convertible
- House 2: Person who is eating mangos
- House 3: Person who owns an SUV
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

So, the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the root beer lover lives.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:

1. The person with a television lives next to the person who drinks tea.
2. The person who eats kiwis lives next to the person who drinks coffee.
3. The person who drinks tea doesn't live in the second house.
4. The person with a television lives next to the guitarist.
5. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who eats a banana lives.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips lives next to the person who has a radio.
7. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From clue 7, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives in house 2. So, house 2 is taken.

From clue 1, the person with a television lives next to the person who drinks tea. Since house 2 is taken by the rose bouquet, the person with a television must be in house 1 and the person who drinks tea must be in house 3.

From clue 3, the person who drinks tea doesn't live in house 2, so house 3 is taken by the person who drinks tea.

From clue 4, the person with a television lives next to the guitarist. Since house 1 is taken by the person with a television, the guitarist must be in house 2. But house 2 is taken by the rose bouquet, so this doesn't work. Let's try again: the person with a television must be in house 3, and the guitarist must be in house 1.

From clue 5, there is one house between where the flutist lives and where the person who eats a banana lives. Since house 1 is taken by the guitarist and house 3 is taken by the person who drinks tea, the flutist must be in house 2, and the person who eats a banana must be in house 3.

From clue 6, the person who has a vase of tulips lives next to the person who has a radio. Since house 2 is taken by the rose bouquet, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1, and the person who has a radio must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with a radio, eating bananas, and having a vase of tulips.
- House 2: Person with a rose bouquet.
- House 3: Person with a television, guitarist, and eating kiwis.

The root beer lover must live in house 1. Therefore, the answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
3. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
5. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
6. There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.
7. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clue 7, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must live somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the third house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's look at the other clues:
- Clue 3 says the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means apples and sandals must be in adjacent houses.
- Clue 4 says the person who is eating apples does not live in the third house, so apples must be in either the first or the fourth house.
- Clue 5 says the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means mangos and sandals must be in adjacent houses.
- Clue 6 says there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. This means if apples are in the first house, sandals and boots must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. But this doesn't fit with the sandals and mangos being adjacent. So, apples must be in the fourth house, and sandals and mangos must be in the first and second houses, respectively.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person eating mangos
- Second house: Person eating sandals
- Third house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic
- Fifth house: Person eating a banana

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. The person who ate fried rice doesn't live in the first house. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house.
2. The person who owns an SUV doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house.
3. The flutist lives next to the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the flutist must live in the first house.
4. The person who wears loafers lives next to the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who wears loafers must live in the first house.

So, we can summarize:
- First house (number 1): Flutist, wears loafers, owns an SUV
- Second house (number 2): Person who likes white, wears sandals, owns an SUV

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the violinist lives.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. Here are the clues again:

1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other.
2. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who eats mangos.
3. The person who only drinks water does not live in the first house.
4. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
5. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. The cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who eats apples.
9. The person who eats apples lives directly left of the violinist.

From clue 4, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house (house 3).

From clue 1, the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house (clue 3), the person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who drives a minivan must live in house 1.

From clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the sedan owner cannot be in house 1 (clue 2), the sedan owner must be in house 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3. But house 3 is occupied by the root beer lover, so the sedan owner must be in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

From clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who eats apples. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the person who eats apples must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, so this is a contradiction. Let's recheck the sedan owner and the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 6, the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. This means the cellist and saxophonist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the cellist must be in house 1, and the saxophonist must be in house 2.

From clue 9, the person who eats apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who eats apples is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

From clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover

The violinist must be in house 2 because the person who eats apples lives directly left of the violinist, and the person who eats apples is in house 2.

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing loafers lives.

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - So, house 3: Yellow

2. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means boots can't be in house 3, 4, or 5.

3. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - So, if fish enthusiast is in house 1, phone is in house 2, and vice versa.

4. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - So, if television is in house 1, fried rice is in house 2, and vice versa.

5. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
   - So, house 2: Not white

6. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - So, if sandals are in house 1, gameboy is in house 2, and vice versa.

7. There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - So, if spaghetti is in house 1, loafers is in house 3, and vice versa.

8. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
   - So, house 3: Not stew

9. The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.
   - So, if cat lover is in house 1, loafers is in house 2, and vice versa.

10. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
    - So, house 5: Grilled cheese

11. The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.
    - So, if cat lover is in house 1, dog owner is in house 2, and vice versa.

12. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
    - So, house 2: High heels

13. The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house.
    - So, house 5: Not red

14. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - So, if loafers are in house 2, gameboy is in house 3, and vice versa.

15. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
    - So, if fish enthusiast is in house 1, radio is in house 2, and vice versa.

16. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television.
    - So, if horses are in house 1, television is in house 2, and vice versa.

17. The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.
    - So, house 4: Blue

18. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
    - So, house 3: Not boots

19. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
    - So, if stew is in house 5, white is in house 4, and vice versa.

From the clues, we can see that:
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Not boots, not yellow, not stew
- House 4: Blue, loafers, not white
- House 5: Grilled cheese, not red, not stew
- House 6: Not white, not red, not stew

Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 5 (since the loafers must be to the right of the cat lover, and the cat lover must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is already occupied by high heels).

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

The answer is (E) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and two people living in them. Each person has a different device and a different type of flower in their foyer. We know the following:

1. The person with the lily bouquet doesn't live in the first house.
2. The person with the television lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the first house (house 1) has a television. So, the person in house 1 has a television.

Since the person in house 1 has a television, the person in house 2 must have the computer (because there's only one computer and one television).

Now, the person in house 1 has a television, so the person in house 2 must have the computer.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues and figure out where each person lives step by step.

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
   - This means the golfer is in House 2 and the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - This means they must be in adjacent houses. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1, the pizza-eater and the history book buff must be in House 1 and House 2 or House 2 and House 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means the guitarist and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

Now, let's combine these clues:

- From Clue 1, we know the golfer is in House 2 and the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1.
- From Clue 2, the pizza-eater and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in House 1, the pizza-eater and the history book buff must be in House 1 and House 2.
- From Clue 3, the guitarist and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

Given these, the only way to fit all the clues is:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic (SFF), Pizza-eater (PE), Person with bouquet of daffodils (D)
- House 2: Golfer (G), History book buff (HBB), Guitarist (Guitarist)

So, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist is in House 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

The correct answer is: (B) 1"
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the violinist lives in house 4.
2. The dog owner does not live in house 2.
3. The fish enthusiast and the horse owner live next to each other.
4. The flutist lives next to the TV owner.
5. The TV owner lives next to the radio owner.
6. The guitarist is to the right of the percussionist.
7. The gameboy owner lives next to the TV owner.
8. The violinist lives in house 4.
9. There are two houses between where the phone owner lives and the horse owner.
10. The bird keeper lives in house 5.

Let's start by placing the violinist in house 4:
- House 4: Violinist

Now, we need to place the phone owner and the horse owner. Since there are two houses between them, they could be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4, but house 4 is taken by the violinist, so they must be in houses 1 and 3:
- House 1: Phone owner
- House 3: Horse owner

Next, the fish enthusiast and the horse owner are next to each other, so they must be in houses 1 and 3:
- House 1: Phone owner
- House 3: Horse owner

Now, the flutist lives next to the TV owner, and the TV owner lives next to the radio owner. This means the TV owner and radio owner must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since house 3 is taken by the horse owner, the TV owner and radio owner must be in houses 2 and 4:
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Horse owner
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

The gameboy owner lives next to the TV owner, so the gameboy owner must be in house 2:
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Horse owner
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

The guitarist is to the right of the percussionist, so the percussionist must be in house 1 and the guitarist in house 2:
- House 1: Phone owner
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Horse owner
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

So, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The answer is: **(A) 1**"
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the violinist lives.

1. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
2. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
4. The basketball player does not live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. So, house 1 is:
- Lilies

From clue 4, the basketball player does not live in house 1, so the basketball player must live in house 2.

Now, let's look at clue 1 and clue 2 together. The person with the radio lives somewhere to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must be to the left of both the violinist and the person with the radio.

Since the person with the bouquet of lilies is in house 1, the person eating apples must be in house 2. So, house 2 is:
- Apples

This means the person with the radio and the violinist must be in house 1. But since the person with the radio is to the right of the person eating apples, the person with the radio must be in house 1 and the violinist must be in house 2.

So, the violinist lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the tennis player lives in the 3rd house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the 5th house.
3. The golfer lives in the 4th house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

Let's fill in the houses based on these clues:

- Tennis player: 3rd house
- Grilled cheese: 5th house
- Golfer: 4th house

Now, we need to place the other people:

- Stew and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 2, with one house between them. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the tennis player is in the 3rd house, the only option is 1 and 2. So, Stew is in the 1st house and Spaghetti is in the 2nd house.
- Pizza must be to the left of the cricketer.
- Fried rice and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 2, and since Spaghetti is in the 2nd house, Fried rice must be in the 1st house.
- Soccer player must be to the left of the tennis player, so the soccer player must be in the 1st house (but it's already taken by Stew), so the soccer player must be in the 2nd house (but it's

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing loafers lives.

1. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. So, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who likes white lives in the first house and the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, the baseball player must live in the first house.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house, the person who only drinks water must live in the first house.

Now, let's summarize the characteristics:
- **House 1:** Person who only drinks water, person who likes white, person who ate spaghetti
- **House 2:** Person who only drinks water (lives in house 1), person who ate spaghetti (lives in house 2), person who likes red, person who plays baseball (lives in house 1), person who wears loafers

From the clues, we know the person who wears loafers must be in the second house because the person who only drinks water is already in the first house.

So, the number of the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is **(A) 2**."
"Let's break down the clues and figure out where the root beer lover lives step by step.

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3. Let's denote the people as A, B, and C, corresponding to houses 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house (house 2). So, the root beer lover can be in house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house (house 2). So, the person eating oranges can be in house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. If the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
- **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means if the coffee drinker is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 3. If the coffee drinker is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 3).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 2).

This configuration does not work because the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2.

- If the root beer lover is in house 3:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing loafers lives.

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 has the spaghetti eater.

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - This means the loafers wearer can't be in House 1.
   - The loafers wearer can be in either House 2 or House 3.

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - So, the fried rice eater can't be in House 2.
   - This means the fried rice eater must be in House 1 or House 3.

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 1.
- Boots wearer is in House 2.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Spaghetti eater
- House 2: Boots wearer
- House 3: Fried rice eater

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

  - If Pizza eater is in house 1 and stew eater is in house 3:

11. There are two houses between the person who only drinks water and the person who wears boots.
12. The person who only drinks water lives next to the person who likes milk.

Let's start filling in the houses:

- House 3: Dog owner
- House 5: Root beer lover

Now, we need to place the other people:

- The person wearing sandals cannot be in House 2, so they must be in House 1 or House 4.
- The coffee drinker and the person with a rose bouquet must be next to each other. They can't be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 and House 2 or House 4 and House 5. But House 5 is taken by the root beer lover, so they must be in House 1 and House 2.
- The person with running shoes and the bird keeper must be next to each other. They can't be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 and House 2 or House 4 and House 5. But House 5 is taken by the root beer lover, so they must be in House 1 and House 2.
- The person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person with the bouquet of lilies must be one house apart. They can't be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 and House 2 or House 4 and House 5. But House 5 is taken by the root beer lover, so they must be in House 1 and House 2.
- The person with the vase of tulips must be somewhere to the left of the dog owner, so they must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 and House 2 are already taken by the coffee drinker and the person with running shoes, so they must be in House 4.
- The person who only drinks water and the person who likes milk must be two houses apart. They can't be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 and House 2 or House 4 and House 5. But House 5 is taken by the root beer lover, so they must be in House 1 and House 2.
- The person who wears loafers must be next to the bird keeper, so they must be in House 1 or House 2. But House 1 and House 2 are already taken by the coffee drinker and the person with running shoes, so they must be in House 4.

So, the only house left for the person with the bouquet of lilies is House 4.

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. The mystery book reader lives in house 1.
2. The tennis player does not live in house 1, so the tennis player must live in house 2.

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the cricketer lives.

1. The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - So, the first house has someone eating kiwis.
   - The second house has someone eating apples.

2. The bird keeper and the person wearing high heels live next to each other.
   - This means they are in the same house.
   - Since the first house has kiwis, the bird keeper and high heels must be in the first house.

3. The tennis player and the person eating apples live next to each other.
   - The tennis player must be in the first house because the apples are in the second house.
   - So, the first house has the tennis player and someone eating kiwis.
   - The second house has the dog owner and someone eating apples.

4. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - So, the second house has the science fiction book fanatic.

5. The dog owner does not live in the first house.
   - The dog owner must be in the second house.

Now we know:
- First house: Tennis player, eating kiwis.
- Second house: Dog owner, eating apples, science fiction book fanatic.

Since the tennis player is in the first house and the dog owner is in the second house, the only person left for the cricketer is in the first house.

So, the cricketer lives in the first house.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Clue 10**: The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 13**: The person who had pizza lives in the fifth house.
3. **Clue 9**: The person who is eating oranges lives in the second house.
4. **Clue 12**: The swimmer lives in the second house.
5. **Clue 7**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer, so the cricketer must be in the third, fourth, or fifth house.
6. **Clue 6**: There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the bird keeper lives.
7. **Clue 11**: The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the person eating apples.
8. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the dog owner lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

From Clue 10, we know:
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 5: Pizza eater
- House 2: Oranges eater
- House 1: Not mentioned yet
- House 4: Not mentioned yet
- House 6: Not mentioned yet

From Clue 12, we know:
- House 2: Swimmer

From Clue 9, we know:
- House 2: Oranges eater

From Clue 13, we know:
- House 5: Pizza eater

From Clue 14, we know:
- House 1: Not mentioned yet
- House 6: Not mentioned yet

From Clue 6, we know:
- There are two houses between the spaghetti eater and the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper can't be in house 1 or 2, and the spaghetti eater can't be in house 4 or 5.

From Clue 11, we know:
- The bird keeper is to the right of the person eating apples. So, the person eating apples can't be in house 5, and the bird keeper can't be in house 1.

Let's try to fit the rest:
- House 1: Not mentioned yet
- House 2: Oranges eater
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Not mentioned yet
- House 5: Pizza eater
- House 6: Not mentioned yet

Since the fish enthusiast is in house 3, the bird keeper must be in house 5 or 6. But house 5 is taken by the pizza eater. So, the bird keeper must be in house 6.

This means the person eating apples must be in house 4, and the person eating kiwis must be in house 1.

So, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating grapes lives is **1**.

The answer is: (E) 1"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

1. The person who likes green lives in the first house. So, the first house is for someone who likes green.
2. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes blue. This means if someone likes blue, the person who had pizza is in the house next to it.
3. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.
5. The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.
6. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes red.
7. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
8. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
9. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
10. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
11. The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
12. The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live directly next to each other.
13. The person who had pizza and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.

Let's put these clues together:

- House 1: Green (person who likes green)
- House 2: Blue (had pizza)
- House 3: Red (or Carnations)
- House 4: Fried Rice (person who ate fried rice)

Now, we need to fit the rest of the clues:

- House 2: Blue (had pizza)
- House 3: Red (or Carnations)
- House 4: Fried Rice

Since the person who had pizza is in House 2, and the person who likes blue is in House 2, we can place the rest:

- House 3: Red (or Carnations)
- House 4: Fried Rice

Now, we need to place the person who likes red and the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the person who likes red is to the left of the person who has a carnations arrangement, and the person who likes red can't be in House 4 (because House 4 is Fried Rice), the person who likes red must be in House 3, and the person who has a carnations arrangement must be in House 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Green
- House 2: Blue (had pizza)
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Fried Rice

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. The person eating grapes doesn't live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person driving a convertible also lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the baseball player lives in the second house. And from Clue 3, the person driving a convertible also lives in the second house. So, the person eating grapes must be the baseball player, and they live in the second house.

Since the person eating grapes lives in the second house, the person eating mangos must live in the first house.

So, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who likes white lives.

1. The person who likes blue lives in the second house. So, the person who likes blue is in house 2.
2. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis. Since blue is in house 2, the person eating kiwis must be in house 1.
3. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating apples must be in house 1 (but that's impossible because only one person can be in house 1). So, the person eating apples must be in house 3, and the person eating oranges must be in house 2. But we already know the person eating oranges is in house 3, so this must be a mix-up. Let's correct it: The person eating apples is in house 1, and the person eating oranges is in house 3.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green is in house 1 (because the person eating kiwis is in house 1), the person who likes white must be in house 3.

So, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have two houses, and we need to figure out which house the person with the rose bouquet lives in. Here are the clues again:

1. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
2. The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person with the gameboy must be in house 1.
- The mystery book reader must be in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player must be in house 1 (because the mystery book reader is in house 2).

From clue 1, we know:
- The root beer lover must be in house 2 (because the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the root beer lover is to the right of the person with the rose bouquet).

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, Gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Root beer, Rose bouquet

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the dog owner lives.

1. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The cat lover does not live in the second house.

From clue 4, we know the fish enthusiast and the dog owner are next to each other. So, they could be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

From clue 2, there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner. This means the truck and the dog owner can't be in houses 1 and 2, because there wouldn't be enough space for two houses between them. So, the truck and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From clue 3, the truck and the sedan are next to each other. So, if the truck is in house 2, the sedan must be in house 3. If the truck is in house 3, the sedan must be in house 4.

Now, let's use clue 1. The minivan must be to the right of the fish enthusiast. So, if the fish enthusiast is in house 1, the minivan must be in house 2. But we already said the truck and the sedan are in houses 2 and 3. So, the fish enthusiast can't be in house 1. If the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the minivan must be in house 3. But then the truck and the sedan would be in houses 3 and 4, which doesn't fit clue 2. So, the fish enthusiast must be in house 3, and the minivan must be in house 4.

Now we have:
- House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
- House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
- House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

So, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler clues:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow. So, the third house is:
- Yellow

From clue 3, the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer. So, the second house is:
- Root beer

Now, we know the third house is yellow and the second house is root beer. This leaves us with the first and fourth houses. 

From clue 1, the person who likes blue must be to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since yellow is in the third house, blue must be in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the person who likes white must be to the right of the person who only drinks water. This doesn't give us a specific house yet, but it tells us the white person is after the water person.

So, the only house left for the person who likes white is the first house, and the only house left for the person who only drinks water is the first house as well. But since the white person must be to the right of the water person, the first house must be:
- Water
- White

This leaves the fourth house for the person who likes blue.

So, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know the following about the people:

1. One person is wearing boots, one is wearing sandals, and one is wearing loafers.
2. One person has a cat, one has a dog, and one has a bird.
3. One person likes green, one likes blue, and one likes white.
4. One person eats oranges, one eats grapes, and one eats mangos.
5. One person plays basketball, one plays baseball, and one plays cricket.

We also have some clues:

1. The cricket player lives somewhere to the right of the person who eats oranges.
2. The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The person who eats grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
5. The person who wears sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
6. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
7. The person who wears loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who eats grapes.

Let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives.

### Clue 6
- The person who likes blue lives in the second house (house 2).

### Clue 1
- The cricket player lives somewhere to the right of the person who eats oranges.

### Clue 2
- The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.

### Clue 3

### Clue 5
- The person who wears sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

### Clue 7
- The person who wears loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who eats grapes.

### Deduction

1. Since the person who likes blue lives in house 2, we know:
   - House 1: Unknown
   - House 2: Person who likes blue
   - House 3: Unknown

2. The cricket player must be in house 3 because they live to the right of the person who eats oranges. So:
   - House 1: Unknown
   - House 2: Person who likes blue
   - House 3: Cricket player

3. The baseball player must be in house 1 because they live to the left of the cat lover. So:
   - House 1: Baseball player
   - House 2: Person who likes blue
   - House 3: Cricket player

4. The person who eats grapes must be in house 3 because they live to the right of the basketball player. So:
   - House 1: Baseball player
   - House 2: Person who likes blue
   - House 3: Cricket player, Person who eats grapes

5. The person who wears sandals must be in house 3 because they live to the right of the dog owner. So:
   - House 1: Baseball player
   - House 2: Person who likes blue
   - House 3: Cricket player, Person who eats grapes, Person who wears sandals

6. The person who wears loafers must be in house 3 because they live to the right of the person who eats grapes. So:
   - House 1: Baseball player
   - House 2: Person who likes blue
   - House 3: Cricket player, Person who eats grapes, Person who wears sandals, Person who wears loafers

### Conclusion

The person who likes white must be the bird keeper, and since the bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (as house 1 is taken by the baseball player), the bird keeper must be in house 3.

So, the bird keeper lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to find out where the tennis player lives.

1. The dog owner lives in the fourth house.
2. The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
3. The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.
4. The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker, so the cellist lives in the fourth house.
5. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk, so the root beer lover lives in the first house and the person who likes milk lives in the second house.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer, so the grilled cheese eater lives in the third house.
7. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
9. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.

12. There is one house between where the pianist lives and where the bird keeper lives.
13. There are two houses between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
14. The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.

From clue 1, the dog owner lives in the fourth house.
From clue 2, the cricketer lives in the fourth house.
From clue 3, the coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.
From clue 4, the cellist lives in the fourth house.
From clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the first house and the person who likes milk lives in the second house.

So, the tennis player lives in the first house.

The answer is (D) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the history book buff lives in.

We have the following clues:
1. The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the tennis player.
2. The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
3. The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
4. The golfer and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house.
6. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
7. The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.
8. The cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white.
9. The cricketer lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
10. There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives.
11. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the fifth house.
12. There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who likes green lives.
13. There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives.

Let's start by placing the person who likes blue in the fifth house because of clue 7:
- House 5: Blue

Next, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who likes white, and the cricketer also lives directly left of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, we can place the cricketer in House 4, white in House 3, and fantasy book enthusiast in House 2:
- House 5: Blue
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 3: White
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast

Now, the tennis player lives directly left of the person who is eating kiwis. So, we can place the tennis player in House 3 and kiwis in House 2:
- House 5: Blue
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 2: Kiwis

The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges. The person who is eating oranges must be in House 1, and the mystery book reader must be in House 4 or House 5. Since House 5 is already taken by blue, the mystery book reader must be in House 4:
- House 5: Blue
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 2: Kiwis
- House 1: Oranges

The person who is eating mangos does not live in the fourth house, so they must be in House 1, 2, or 3. Since oranges are in House 1, mangos must be in House 2 or 3. But since kiwis are in House 2, mangos must be in House 3:
- House 5: Blue
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 2: Kiwis
- House 1: Oranges
- House 3: Mangos

The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green. Since oranges are in House 1 and kiwis are in House 2, the swimmer must be in House 1 and the person who likes green must be in House 5:
- House 5: Blue
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 2: Kiwis
- House 1: Oranges
- House 3: Mangos
- House 1: Swimming
- House 5: Blue

There are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the tennis player lives. The tennis player is in House 3, so the romance book lover must be in House 1 or House 2. Since oranges are in House 1 and kiwis are in House 2, the romance book lover must be in House 2:
- House 5: Blue
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 2: Kiwis
- House 1: Oranges
- House 3: Mangos
- House 1: Swimming
- House 2: Romance book lover

Finally, there are two houses between where the romance book lover lives and where the mystery book reader lives. The romance book lover is in House 2 and the mystery book reader must be in House 4:
- House 5: Blue
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 3: Tennis player
- House 2: Kiwis
- House 1: Oranges
- House 3: Mangos
- House 1: Swimming
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 4: Mystery book reader

So, the person who is eating mangos lives in House 3, and the history book buff must live in the remaining house, which is House 1.

The number of the house where the history book buff lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (E) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. There are three people, each with a different instrument, device, and pet. The clues are:
1. The cellist lives next to the person with the gameboy.
2. The dog owner doesn't live in house 1.

Let's think about it:
- If the cellist is in house 1, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 2 (because they are neighbors and the cellist is to the left).
- If the cellist is in house 2, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 1 (because they are neighbors and the cellist is to the left).

But we know the dog owner can't be in house 1. So, the only way to fit all the clues is if the cellist is in house 1 and the person with the gameboy is in house 2. This means the dog owner must be in house 2.

So, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns an SUV lives.

1. The person with a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - So, house 3: Gameboy

2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - So, house 1: Minivan

3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the phone and SUV must be next to each other, and the phone must be to the left of the SUV.

4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

Now, let's fill in the houses we know:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be next to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, the only place left for the phone is house 2. So, house 2 must have the phone, and house 3 must have the SUV.

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with carnations lives.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a different person with a different flower and a different device. Here are the clues again:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
2. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a television.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the third house.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a radio.
5. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the fourth house.
6. The person who has a computer lives in the second house.
7. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

Let's use these clues to figure out the houses:

- House 2: Computer (Clue 6)
- House 3: Tulips (Clue 3)
- House 1: Phone (Clue 2, since the phone is left of the television, and the computer is in house 2)
- House 5: Lilies (Clue 1, since the lilies are to the right of the phone, and house 5 is the only place left for the lilies)
- House 4: Daffodils (Clue 4, since the daffodils are to the right of the radio, and house 4 is the only place left for the daffodils)

Now, we need to place the rose bouquet and carnations arrangement. Since the rose bouquet is directly left of the carnations arrangement, and we know the computer is in house 2, the only place left for the rose bouquet is house 1, and the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.

So, the person with carnations arrangement lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the dog owner lives.

1. The cricketer lives in the second house.
2. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
3. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fifth house.
5. The fish enthusiast lives in the second house.
6. The bird keeper lives in the first house.
7. The person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other.
8. There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
9. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house.
10. The baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
11. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.
12. There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.

From clue 5, we know the fish enthusiast lives in the second house. But clue 1 says the cricketer lives in the second house. This means there's a contradiction here, so the fish enthusiast must be someone else. Let's assume the fish enthusiast lives in the third, fourth, or fifth house.

From clue 6, the bird keeper lives in the first house. So, the bird keeper is in house 1.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer is in house 2, the person with loafers must be in house 1. But house 1 is already taken by the bird keeper, so this is a contradiction. Let's assume the cricketer is in house 3 and the person with loafers is in house 2.

From clue 8, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives. Since the bird keeper is in house 1, the person with sandals must be in house 3 or 2. But house 2 is taken by the cricketer, so the person with sandals must be in house 3.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house. So, the person with running shoes must be in house 5.

From clue 10, the baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person with sandals is in house 3, the baseball player must be in house 4 or 5. But house 5 is taken by the person with running shoes, so the baseball player must be in house 4.

From clue 11, the cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the golfer is in house 4, the cat lover must be in house 5.

From clue 12, there is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. Since the person with boots is in house 5, the person who owns horses must be in house 4 or 3. But house 4 is taken by the cat lover, so the person who owns horses must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Bird Keeper
- House 2: Cricketer, Loafers
- House 3: Horses, Dog Owner
- House 4: Cat Lover, Golfers
- House 5: Running Shoes, Baseball Player

The dog owner lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who had pizza lives.

1. **Root Beer Lover and Water Lover**: The root beer lover does not live in house 1, so they must live in house 2.
2. **Grapes and Computer**: The person eating grapes lives directly left of the person with the computer. So, the computer must be in house 1 and the grapes in house 2.
3. **Radio and Truck**: The person with the radio and the person driving the truck live next to each other.
4. **Radio and Pizza**: The person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza.

From clue 2, we know:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Grapes

From clue 4, the person with the radio must be in house 1 (because they live to the left of the person who had pizza) and the person who had pizza must be in house 1.

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who likes green lives.

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 is the tea drinker.

2. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the milk drinker and the spaghetti eater can't be next to each other.

3. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the yellow liker can't be next to each other.

4. The person who likes white and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - So, the white liker and the water drinker must be in adjacent houses.

5. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the tea drinker (House 1) and the pizza eater (House 2) are next to each other.

6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the spaghetti eater and the water drinker can't be next to each other.

7. The person who likes green does not live in the first house.
   - So, the green liker can't be in House 1.

8. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.
   - So, the grilled cheese eater can't be in House 1.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- The green liker can't be in House 1.
- The green liker can't be in House 4 (since the grilled cheese eater is there).
- The green liker can't be in House 2 (since the pizza eater is there).
- The green liker must be in House 3.

So, the person who likes green lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."

12. The person who likes white lives in the third house.
13. The fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From Clue 4, we know the dog owner lives in the third house. So, the person who only drinks water must live in the second house (Clue 2).

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. And from Clue 11, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers. So, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the second house, and the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 12, the person who likes white lives in the third house. This means the person who likes white is in the third house, and the person who likes red must be in the second house (Clue 3).

From Clue 1, the person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house. Since the person who likes white is in the third house, the person who likes yellow must be in the first house.

From Clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner is in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first house.

From Clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. The person who owns a sedan must be in the first house (Clue 13), so the person who likes milk must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. The person who is wearing sandals must be in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must be in the second house. So, the person who likes root beer must be in the first house, and the person who likes coffee must be in the fourth house.

So, the only house left for the person who likes red is the second house.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a different person living in it with different characteristics. We need to use the clues to figure out the arrangement.

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
   - So, House 3: Person wearing running shoes.

2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the person who likes milk can't be in House 5, and the person who drinks water can't be in House 1.

9. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Person wearing running shoes.

10. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.

From the clues, we can deduce that the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 1, and the person who is eating grapes must be in House 2.

So, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in **House 1**.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. The people play different sports, eat different foods, and have different flowers in their houses. Here are the clues again:

1. The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The soccer player lives in the third house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.

Let's use these clues to figure out the arrangement:

- From clue 3, we know the soccer player lives in house number 3.
- From clue 1, the golfer and the basketball player are next to each other, and the golfer is to the left of the basketball player. So, they must be in houses 1 and 2.
- From clue 2, the person who has lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese are next to each other, and the person with lilies is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. So, the person with lilies must be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.
- From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese (in house 2) must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4.
- From clue 5, the person who has tulips does not live in house 3. Since the soccer player is in house 3, the person with tulips must be in either house 1 or house 2. But we already know the person with lilies is in house 1, so the person with tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with lilies
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who ate fried rice also lives in the third house (Clue 9 contradicts Clue 7, so we'll stick with Clue 9).

Now, let's see where the other people can live:

- The third house is taken by the person who ate fried rice.
- The fourth house is taken by the person who ate spaghetti.
- The fifth house is taken by the person who likes red.

So, the remaining houses are the first, second, and fifth houses. Let's look at the clues again:

- The saxophonist does not live in the fifth house (Clue 1).
- The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house (Clue 5).
- The person who likes yellow lives two houses away from the person who likes white (Clue 8).
- The person who likes blue lives in the first house (Clue 10).
- The person who likes yellow lives in the second house (since the fifth house is taken by the person who likes red and the fourth house is taken by the person who ate spaghetti).
- The person who likes white lives in the fifth house (since the second house is taken by the person who likes yellow and the fifth house is taken by the person who likes red).

So, the first house is taken by the person who likes blue, the second house is taken by the person who likes yellow, and the fifth house is taken by the person who likes red.

This leaves the third house, which is taken by the person who ate fried rice.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing running shoes lives.

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - So, the third house is occupied by the tea drinker.

2. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who had stew is in a house with a lower number than the person who ate spaghetti.

3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - This means the root beer lover is in a house with a higher number than the person who is wearing sandals.

4. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - This means the person who only drinks water is in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese.

5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the person who is wearing running shoes is in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew.

6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - This means they are in adjacent houses.

7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.
   - So, the person who ate grilled cheese can only be in house 2, 3, or 4.

Since the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1 (Clue 7), and the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 4), the only option left for the person who ate grilled cheese is house 2.

Now, the person who only drinks water must be in house 4 because it's the only house left and it must be next to the person who is wearing high heels.

So, we have:
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Only drinks water

This leaves house 1 for the person who had stew and house 3 for the tea drinker.

Now, the only person left is the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the person who is wearing running shoes must be to the left of the person who had stew (Clue 5), and the person who had stew is in house 1, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

8. The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
10. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the fifth house.
11. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
12. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
13. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

From clue 1, we know the cricketer lives in the third house. From clue 2, the person who is wearing loafers also lives in the third house. From clue 5, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. From clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the fifth house. From clue 11, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house. From clue 12, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. From clue 13, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

Now, let's fill in the houses:

- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- First house: root beer lover (since the root beer lover does not live in the first house and the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio, the root beer lover must be in the first house)
- Second house: tea drinker (since the tea drinker must be somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk, and the root beer lover is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the second house)
- First house: root beer lover
- Second house: tea drinker
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk (since the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in the fifth house)
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Sixth house: person who had stew (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the sixth house)
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who had stew
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Seventh house: person who had stew
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, and the third house is occupied by the cricketer, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the eighth house)
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers
- Ninth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Ninth house: person who had stew
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the tenth house)
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese
- Eleventh house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives in the ninth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the eleventh house)
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From the above, the person with the computer lives directly next to the soccer player. Since the soccer player and the person with the computer live next to each other, and the cricketer lives in the third house, the soccer player must be in the second house, and the person with the computer must be in the fourth house.

So, the person with the computer lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, house 1 and house 2. One person in each house has different lunch and likes different books.

- House 1: One person ate pizza and likes science fiction books.
- House 2: One person ate fried rice and likes history books.

The clue tells us that the person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction books. This means the person who likes science fiction books must be in house 1, because house 2 is to the right of house 1.

So, the person who likes science fiction books and ate pizza lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We know the following:

1. The pianist lives in the first house.
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the pianist lives in house 1. So, house 1 has the pianist.

From clue 2, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. This means the person who owns horses must be in house 1, and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

From clue 3, the person who likes white does not live in the second house. Since the second house is house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1.

So, in house 1, we have the person who owns horses (let's call this person ""Horses owner"") and the person who likes white (let's call this person ""White liker""). In house 2, we have the root beer lover (let's call this person ""Root beer lover"").

Since the person who owns horses is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 1.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the percussionist lives.

1. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. So, house 4 is for pizza.
2. The person who had stew lives in the second house. So, house 2 is for stew.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist. This means the guitarist can't be in house 4, and the violinist can't be in house 1.
4. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
5. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
6. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house. This is already given.

So, we have:
- House 4: Pizza
- House 2: Stew

Now, the guitarist and violinist must be in houses 1 and 3, but not in houses 4 and 1. So, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the violinist in house 3.

This leaves:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist

Now, the history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist. The only place left for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic is house 3 and house 4, but house 3 is already taken by the violinist. So, the history book buff must be in house 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 4.

This leaves house 1 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 2 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Violinist
- House 4: Pizza

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns horses lives.

1. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - So, the first house has someone who likes white.

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - So, the second house is not for the person wearing boots.

3. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
   - So, the third house is not for the bird keeper.

4. The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the first and second houses have these two people.

5. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person who likes green is in the first house, and the person who is wearing running shoes is in the second house.

6. The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means the dog owner is in the third house.

7. The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the third house has the person who owns horses, and the second house has the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

8. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the first house has the person who is wearing sandals, and the second house has the person who has a vase of tulips.

From clue 4, we know the first house has someone who likes white and the second house has someone who has daffodils. From clue 5, the first house has someone who likes green and the second house has someone who is wearing running shoes. From clue 7, the third house has the person who owns horses and the second house has the person who has daffodils. From clue 6, the dog owner is in the third house. From clue 8, the first house has someone who is wearing sandals and the second house has someone who has a vase of tulips.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Likes white, Wearing sandals
- House 2: Has daffodils, Wearing running shoes
- House 3: Owns horses, Wearing boots

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who likes milk lives.

1. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. The person who eats mangos lives directly left of the person who eats apples.
3. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who eats apples lives in the third house.

From clue 4, we know the person who eats apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement looks like this:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person who eats apples

From clue 2, the person who eats mangos must live directly left of the person who eats apples. Since the person who eats apples is in the third house, the person who eats mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person who eats mangos
- House 3: Person who eats apples

From clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person who eats mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person who eats mangos
- House 3: Person who eats apples

From clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person who eats mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing boots lives.

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - So, House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

2. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means they must be in Houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means they must be in Houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1: Carnations arrangement

5. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means they must live in either House 1 or House 2.

6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 4, we know the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in House 1. So, House 1: Carnations arrangement.

From Clue 1, the science fiction book fanatic lives in House 2. So, House 2: Science fiction book fanatic.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6).
- The person who likes white must be in House 3 (Clue 3).

Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips, and the person who likes white must be in House 3, the only place left for the person who likes red is House 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 3: Person who likes red

This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1 because they cannot be in House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. The people have different flowers and drinks:

- One person has lilies.
- One person has tulips.
- One person has roses.
- One person drinks milk.
- One person drinks root beer.
- One person only drinks water.

We know the following clues:
1. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
3. The person who has lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has tulips.
4. The person who has lilies lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person who only drinks water lives in house 1. So, house 1 is occupied by the person who only drinks water.

From clue 4, the person who has lilies lives in house 2. So, house 2 is occupied by the person who has lilies.

Now, we need to place the person who likes milk. From clue 1, there is one house between the person who only drinks water (house 1) and the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes milk must be in house 3. This means house 3 is occupied by the person who likes milk.

Now, we need to place the person who has tulips and the person who has roses. The person who has lilies (in house 2) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has tulips. Since the person who has lilies is in house 2, the person who has tulips must be in house 1 or house 3. But house 1 is already taken by the person who only drinks water. So, the person who has tulips must be in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who has roses.

So, the person who has roses lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's go through the clues step by step to figure out where the cricketer lives.

1. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
2. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
4. The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

9. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
10. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
11. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.

From clue 9, we know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes green.

From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who has a radio must live in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the person who has a radio.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a phone lives in the second house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the third house or the fourth house. But the third house is already occupied by the person who likes yellow. So, the person who has a gameboy must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who likes yellow lives in the third house, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the fourth house. So, the cricketer must live in the third house.

From clue 1, the person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the person who has a radio, the person who is wearing boots must live in the first or the fourth house. But the first house is already occupied by the person who likes green, so the person who is wearing boots must live in the fourth house.

So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots, the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the second house is occupied by the person who has a radio, and the first house is occupied by the person who likes green.

This leaves the second house for the cricketer.

Therefore, the cricketer lives in house 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and we need to figure out where the person who likes yellow lives. Here are the clues again:

1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in house 1. So, house 1 is yellow.

Now, let's use clue 2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff must be in house 3, and the romance book lover must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in the first house. Since the first house is yellow, the person who had pizza must be in either house 2 or house 3. But house 2 is green, so the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

The person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the computer lives.

1. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

First, let's place the tennis player and the television. Since the tennis player must be to the left of the television, the possible pairs are:
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 3
- Tennis player in house 2, television in house 3

Next, the golfer cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3. But since the tennis player is already in house 1, the golfer must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Golfer (G) in house 3

This leaves house 2 for the computer and house 3 for the radio and rose bouquet. Since the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses (Clue 3), and the radio and rose bouquet must be in adjacent houses (Clue 4 and Clue 5), we need to place the computer and tulips in house 2 and the radio and rose bouquet in house 3.

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- House 1: Tennis player (T)
- House 2: Computer (C) and Tulips (Tul)
- House 3: Radio (R) and Rose bouquet (Rb)

So, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given.

1. The swimmer lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Swimmer

2. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist can't be in house 5, and the carnations person can't be in house 1.

3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - If sandals are in house X, tulips are in house X+1.

4. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - If running shoes are in house X, daffodils are in house X+1.

5. The violinist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Violinist

6. The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - If basketball player is in house X, guitarist is in house X+1.

7. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - If high heels are in house X, lilies are in house X+1.

8. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - If loafers are in house X, percussionist is in house X+1.

9. The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Cricketer

10. The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
    - They must be in houses X and X+1.

11. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

12. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.
    - This means if sandals are in house X, cellist is in house X+3 or X-3 (but since houses are numbered 1 to 5, X-3 is not possible).

Now, let's use these clues to figure out the rest:

- House 1: Not possible for violinist, cricketer, or cellist.
- House 2: Violinist.
- House 3: Swimmer.
- House 4: Cricketer.
- House 5: Bouquet of daffodils.

Since the daffodils are in house 5, the running shoes must be in house 4 (since they live directly left of the daffodils).

So, house 4: Running shoes, Bouquet of daffodils.

Now, the only person left for house 1 is the person wearing sandals. The only person left for house 2 is the violinist. The only person left for house 3 is the swimmer. The only person left for house 5 is the person with the bouquet of lilies. The only person left for house 4 is the cricketer.

So, the only person left for house 1 is the person wearing sandals.

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (E) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. There are two people, and each has a different pet, ate a different lunch, and wears different shoes. Here are the clues:

1. The person wearing high heels lives next to the fish enthusiast.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese. So, the person in house 2 is wearing high heels and ate grilled cheese.

From clue 1, the person wearing high heels lives next to the fish enthusiast. Since the fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (because the person in house 2 is wearing high heels), the fish enthusiast is in house 1 and the person wearing high heels is in house 2.

So, the person in house 1 must be the dog owner (because the fish enthusiast is the fish enthusiast and the person in house 2 is the one who ate grilled cheese and wears high heels).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to find out where the cat lover lives.

11. The person who likes red and the romance book lover live next to each other.
12. The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue.
13. The person who owns horses lives in the 2nd house.

From clue 2, we know the 2nd house is for the person who owns horses. So, the 2nd house is occupied.

From clue 1, the romance book lover is in the 5th house.

From clue 7, the fish enthusiast is in the 3rd house.

From clue 11, the person who likes red and the romance book lover live next to each other. Since the romance book lover is in the 5th house, the person who likes red must be in the 4th house.

From clue 12, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who likes blue. Since the romance book lover is in the 5th house, the person who likes blue must be in the 4th house, and the mystery book reader must be in the 3rd house.

From clue 13, the person who owns horses is in the 2nd house, and we already know the fish enthusiast is in the 3rd house.

Now, we have:
- 2nd house: Person who owns horses
- 3rd house: Fish enthusiast
- 4th house: Person who likes red
- 5th house: Romance book lover

From clue 3, the person who likes yellow and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are next to each other. Since the 3rd house is for the fish enthusiast, the 4th house is for the person who likes red, and the 5th house is for the romance book lover, the 2nd house is for the person who owns horses, and the 3rd house is for the fish enthusiast, the 4th house must be for the person who likes yellow and the 5th house for the romance book lover.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils are next to each other. Since the 4th house is for the person who likes yellow, the 5th house is for the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

So, the 1st house must be for the cat lover.

Therefore, the cat lover lives in the 1st house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person eating oranges lives.

1. The person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other.
2. The person with a phone lives in the third house.
3. The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.
4. The flutist lives in the third house.
5. The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots.
6. The person wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
7. The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.

11. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person eating oranges.
12. The person eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
13. The science fiction book fanatic and the person wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From clue 2, we know the person with a phone lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person with a phone.

From clue 4, the flutist lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the flutist.

From clue 6, the person wearing running shoes also lives in the third house. This contradicts clue 2, so we need to re-evaluate. Since clue 2 states the phone lives in the third house, and clue 6 states the running shoes live in the third house, we need to consider the possibility that the phone and running shoes are different people.

From clue 1, the person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other. Let's denote the person eating grapes as G and the person eating oranges as O. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From clue 5, the person eating oranges (O) lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots (B). From clue 3, the saxophonist (S) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots (B). This means B must be to the right of S.

From clue 7, the romance book lover (R) lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic (SF). This means R and SF must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person wearing high heels (HH) lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast (FB) lives. This means HH and FB must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 5 (but since we only have 4 houses, it must be 1 and 4).

From clue 12, the history book buff (HB) lives somewhere to the left of the person eating oranges (O). This means HB must be in house 1 or 2.

From clue 13, the person eating kiwis (K) does not live in the first house. So K must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 14, the percussionist (P) lives in the fourth house. So P is in house 4.

From clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic (SF) and the person wearing running shoes (RS) live directly next to each other. Since RS lives in the third house, SF must live in the second house.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: HB (History book buff)
- House 2: SF (Science fiction book fanatic)
- House 3: RS (Running shoes)
- House 4: P (Percussionist)

Since the person eating oranges (O) must be to the right of the person wearing boots (B) and B must be to the right of S, and O must be to the right of B, the only possible positions for O and B are:
- O in house 4 (since P is in house 4)
- B in house 3 (since RS is in house 3)

This leaves the person eating grapes (G) and the person wearing boots (B) in houses 1 and 2. Since HB is in house 1, B must be in house 2, and G must be in house 1.

So, the person eating oranges lives in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who is eating apples lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. **Clue 3:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

Let's start by figuring out the positions of the people who had pizza and the person who likes yellow.

- **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. This means if the person who had pizza is in house 1, the person who likes yellow is in house 2. If the person who had pizza is in house 2, the person who likes yellow is in house 3, and so on.

Now, let's consider the person who likes white and the person who only drinks water.

- **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means if the person who had stew is in house 1, the person who only drinks water is in house 2. If the person who had stew is in house 2, the person who only drinks water is in house 3, and so on.

From Clue 8, the person who had stew does not live in the third house. So, the person who had stew can live in house 1 or house 4.

- If the person who had stew is in house 1, the person who only drinks water is in house 2. This means the person who likes white must live in house 4.
- If the person who had stew is in house 4, the person who only drinks water is in house 3. This means the person who likes white must live in house 1.

Now, let's consider the person who is eating oranges and the person who is eating apples.

- **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. This means if the person who is eating oranges is in house 1, the person who is eating apples is in house 2. If the person who is eating oranges is in house 2, the person who is eating apples is in house 3, and so on.

From Clue 1, the root beer lover and the person who likes milk must live next to each other. This means they can be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4.

- If the person who is eating oranges is in house 1, the person who is eating apples must be in house 2. But we already know the person who only drinks water is in house 2, so this is not possible.
- If the person who is eating oranges is in house 2, the person who is eating apples must be in house 3. But we already know the person who likes yellow is in house 3, so this is not possible.
- If the person who is eating oranges is in house 3, the person who is eating apples must be in house 4. This fits with the person who likes white living in house 1 and the person who only drinks water living in house 2.

So, the final configuration is:
- House 1: Person who likes white, eating grapes
- House 2: Person who only drinks water, eating apples
- House 3: Person who likes yellow, eating mangos
- House 4: Person who likes red, eating oranges

Therefore, the person who is eating apples lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

- **House 2:** SUV, Science fiction book fanatic, Truck, Mystery book reader
- **House 3:** History book buff, Fantasy book enthusiast, Fried rice, High heels

The person who had pizza lives in **House 4**.

So, the answer is (A) 4."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the violinist lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

From Clue 7, the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the saxophonist.

From Clue 6, the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

Now, let's use Clue 4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 1, the romance book lover (in the second house) lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house. But we already know the third house is occupied by the saxophonist. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the guitarist must be in the third house, and the history book buff must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is occupied by the romance book lover. So, the history book buff must be in the first house.

So, the final positions are:
- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Romance book lover
- **House 3:** Saxophonist
- **House 4:** Mystery book reader
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast

The violinist must be in the third house, as the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the gameboy lives.

We know:
1. The person with the television lives in house 4.
2. The person with loafers lives in house 2.
3. The person with the phone does not live in house 2.
4. The person with boots lives somewhere to the left of the person with loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person with the radio lives and where the person with sandals lives.

Let's fill in what we know:
- House 4: Television
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone (since the phone can't be in house 2)
- House 1: Boots (since boots must be to the left of loafers)

Now we have:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television

We need to place the radio and sandals. Since there are two houses between the radio and sandals, and we have houses 1, 2, 3, and 4 left, the only way to fit this is if the radio is in house 1 and sandals are in house 3. This fits all the clues.

So, the person with the gameboy must be in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler clues:

1. The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
   - So, the person in high heels lives in house number 2.

2. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - This means the coffee drinker can't be in house number 2. Since the high heels person is in house number 2, the coffee drinker must be in either house number 1 or house number 3.

3. The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes milk must be in either house number 2 or house number 3.

4. The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
   - This is consistent with the previous clue. The coffee drinker can't be in house number 1.

5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
   - So, the person in running shoes lives in house number 3.

Now, let's put it all together:
- The person in high heels lives in house number 2.
- The person in running shoes lives in house number 3.
- The person who likes milk cannot be in house number 1, so they must be in house number 2 (because the high heels person is there).
- The coffee drinker must be in house number 1 (since they can't be in house number 2 or 3).

So, the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). There are two people, one in each house. They like different types of books and wear different types of shoes.

1. The person wearing loafers doesn't live in house 1.
2. The mystery book reader doesn't live in house 2.

From clue 1, we know the person wearing loafers must live in house 2 because they can't be in house 1.

From clue 2, the mystery book reader can't be in house 2, so they must be in house 1.

That means the person in house 1 is the mystery book reader, and the person in house 2 is the one wearing loafers.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out which house the person who had pizza lives in.

We have the following clues:
1. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other.
2. The person who had pizza lives next to the person who is wearing sandals.
3. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house.
4. The person who has a vase of tulips lives next to the person who had pizza.
5. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
6. The person who is wearing running shoes lives next to the person who had stew.
7. The person who has a television lives next to the person who has a radio.
8. The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who has a rose bouquet live next to each other.
9. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
10. The person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who has a radio.

Let's start by placing the person who had pizza and the person who is wearing sandals based on clue 2 and clue 9:

- Clue 2: The person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S) must be next to each other.
- Clue 9: The person who is wearing boots (B) must be to the left of the person who had pizza (P).

Let's try different placements:

- If P is in house 1, then S must be in house 2 (since they are next to each other and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 2, then B must be in house 1 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is not possible because P and S must be next to each other, and B must be to the left of P. So, let's try another arrangement:

- If P is in house 2, then S must be in house 3 (since they are next to each other and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 3, then B must be in house 2 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is also not possible because P and S must be next to each other, and B must be to the left of P.

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4 (since they are next to each other and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is possible. Let's check the other clues with this arrangement:

- Clue 1: The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a gameboy (G) live next to each other.
- Clue 4: The person who has a vase of tulips (T) lives next to the person who had pizza (P).
- Clue 5: The person who has a carnations arrangement (C) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
- Clue 6: The person who is wearing running shoes (R) lives next to the person who had stew (St).
- Clue 7: The person who has a television (Tv) lives next to the person who has a radio (Rd).
- Clue 8: The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a rose bouquet (Rb) live next to each other.
- Clue 10: The person who ate spaghetti (Sp) lives next to the person who has a radio (Rd).

Let's place the remaining items:

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4.
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (Clue 9).
- If R is in house 2, then G must be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- If T is in house 1, then C must be in house 2 (Clue 4).
- If R is in house 2, then St must be in house 3 (Clue 6).
- If Rb is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 8).
- If Sp is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 10).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. One person lives in each house. We know some things about the people:

1. One person eats mangos, and one person eats apples.
2. One person has a rose bouquet, and one person has a lily bouquet.
3. One person plays the piano, and one person plays the saxophone.

We also have these clues:
1. The person with the rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person with the lily bouquet.
2. The saxophone player doesn't live in the first house.
3. The person who eats mangos lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person who eats mangos lives in house 1. So, house 1 has the mangos.

Now, clue 2 tells us the saxophone player doesn't live in house 1, so the saxophone player must live in house 2.

Clue 1 says the rose bouquet is to the left of the lily bouquet. Since the mangos are in house 1, the rose bouquet must be in house 1 and the lily bouquet in house 2. This matches clue 1.

So, the person who eats apples must live in house 2 because the mangos are in house 1 and the saxophone player is in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who eats apples lives is 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

From clue 16, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house, the person with a television must live in one of the houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who drives the truck lives.

1. The person with tulips doesn't live in the third house.
2. The person with an SUV lives next to the person with lilies.
3. The person with a sedan and the person with roses live next to each other.
4. The person with roses doesn't live in the second house.

Let's consider the houses from left to right: 1, 2, 3.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Clue 4**: The person with roses can't be in house 2. So, they can be in house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 2**: The person with an SUV and the person with lilies are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
- **Clue 3**: The person with a sedan and the person with roses are neighbors.

Let's try different placements:

1. **If the person with roses is in house 1:**
   - The person with roses is in house 1.
   - The person with lilies must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors and the person with roses is in house 1).
   - The person with an SUV must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors and the person with lilies is in house 3).
   - The person with tulips must be in house 2 (since they can't be in house 3 and the person with an SUV is in house 2).
   - This doesn't work because the person with roses and the person with a sedan can't be neighbors.

2. **If the person with roses is in house 3:**
   - The person with roses is in house 3.
   - The person with lilies must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors and the person with roses is in house 3).
   - The person with an SUV must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors and the person with lilies is in house 2).
   - The person with tulips must be in house 2 (since they can't be in house 3 and the person with an SUV is in house 1).
   - This doesn't work because the person with roses and the person with a sedan can't be neighbors.

3. **If the person with roses is in house 1:**
   - The person with roses is in house 1.
   - The person with lilies must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors and the person with roses is in house 1).
   - The person with an SUV must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors and the person with lilies is in house 2).
   - The person with tulips must be in house 2 (since they can't be in house 3 and the person with an SUV is in house 3).
   - This doesn't work because the person with roses and the person with a sedan can't be neighbors.

4. **If the person with roses is in house 3:**
   - The person with roses is in house 3.
   - The person with lilies must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors and the person with roses is in house 3).
   - The person with an SUV must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors and the person with lilies is in house 2).
   - The person with tulips must be in house 2 (since they can't be in house 3 and the person with an SUV is in house 1).
   - This works because the person with roses and the person with a sedan can't be neighbors.

So, the person with roses is in house 3, the person with lilies is in house 2, the person with an SUV is in house 1, and the person with tulips is in house 2.

Therefore, the person who drives the truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. So, House 4: Lilies.
2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house. So, House 5: Tulips.
3. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the second house. So, House 2 is not for the science fiction book fanatic.
4. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. So, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3 or 4.
5. The violinist does not live in the fourth house. So, the violinist cannot be in House 4.
6. The person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other. So, they must be in adjacent houses.
7. The piano player and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other. So, they must be in adjacent houses.
8. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader. So, the mystery book reader cannot be in House 1.
9. The history book buff lives directly left of the percussionist. So, the percussionist cannot be in House 1.
10. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. So, the cellist cannot be in House 5.
11. The piano player and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other. So, they must be in Houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. But since the piano player and the mystery book reader are next to each other, and the piano player can't be in House 5, the only possible pairs are (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5).

Let's try to fit everything:

- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips
- House 2: Not science fiction book fanatic
- House 3: Not science fiction book fanatic (since House 2 is not possible)
- House 1: Not science fiction book fanatic (since House 2 is not possible)
- House 4: Lilies (already assigned)
- House 5: Tulips (already assigned)
- House 3: Not science fiction book fanatic (since House 2 is not possible)
- House 2: Not science fiction book fanatic (since House 1 is not possible)
- House 1: Not science fiction book fanatic (since House 2 is not possible)

Now, let's fit the rest:

- The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. So, the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in House 3 or 4.
- The violinist does not live in the fourth house. So, the violinist cannot be in House 4.
- The person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
- The piano player and the mystery book reader live directly next to each other.

Let's try House 1 for the piano player and the mystery book reader:
- House 1: Piano player and mystery book reader
- House 2: Not science fiction book fanatic (so it could be violinist, flute, or cellist)
- House 3: Not science fiction book fanatic (so it could be violinist, flute, or cellist)
- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips

Since the piano player and the mystery book reader are next to each other, and the violinist is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, we can fit the rest:
- House 1: Piano player and mystery book reader
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Flute
- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips

So, the person who likes milk must be in House 3 because the piano player and the mystery book reader are next to each other and the violinist is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in House 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the basketball player lives.

1. The cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.
2. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
3. The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the person who likes white.
6. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white.
7. The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
8. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.
9. The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.
10. The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
11. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white.
12. The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
13. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
14. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives.

From clue 13, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

From clue 9, the person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 10, the person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

From clue 11, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating a banana, the person who likes white must be in the third house. So, the person who drives a minivan must be in the first house.

From clue 1, the cricketer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible. Since the person who drives a convertible is in the fourth house, the cricketer must be in the first house. But we already know the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow. So, the cricketer must be in the second house.

From clue 6, the swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white is in the third house, the swimmer must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is occupied by the person who is eating a banana. So, the swimmer must be in the first house.

From clue 7, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges. Since the second house is occupied by the person who is eating a banana, the person who is eating oranges must be in the fourth house. So, the person who is eating mangos must be in the third house.

Now, the only house left for the basketball player is the fourth house. The person who likes green lives in the fourth house.

So, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes blue lives step by step.

We know:
1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow lives next to the person who likes green.
3. The person who had stew lives next to the romance book lover.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese doesn't live in the second house.
5. The person who had stew lives next to the romance book lover.

From clue 2, since the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

From clue 3, the person who had stew lives next to the romance book lover. Since the person who likes yellow is in the second house, the person who had stew must be in the first house. This means the romance book lover is in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese doesn't live in the second house. Since the second house is taken by the romance book lover, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

From clue 5, the person who had stew lives next to the romance book lover. Since the person who had stew is in the first house and the romance book lover is in the second house, this is consistent.

So, we have:
- First house: Person who ate grilled cheese
- Second house: Person who had stew, romance book lover
- Third house: Person who likes green, fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person who likes green lives in the third house and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes blue lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the bird keeper lives.

1. The person with carnations is in the first house.
2. The person who likes yellow is in the third house.
3. The person with a vase of tulips and the bird keeper are next to each other.
4. There is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck.
5. The person with a sedan is next to the fish enthusiast.
6. The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue are next to each other.
7. The person with a rose bouquet is next to the person who owns horses.
8. The cellist is not in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the first house has carnations. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- First house: Carnations (person with carnations)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Second house: Vase of tulips and bird keeper
- Fourth house: Rose bouquet and person who likes blue (next to the person who owns horses)
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Second house: Percussionist or cellist
- Third house: Truck (next to the percussionist or cellist)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the mystery book reader lives.

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
2. The cellist lives in the first house.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. But from clue 2, we know the cellist also lives in house 1. This seems to be a contradiction because only one person can live in each house. So, let's think about it again.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist can't both be in house 1, let's assume the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1 and the cellist is in house 2.

Now, clue 3 tells us that the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (who likes green) is in house 1, the person who likes red must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast (likes green)
- House 2: Cellist (plays the cello), Person who likes red

This means the mystery book reader must be in house 1 because the fantasy book enthusiast is already there.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

3. **History book buff and person eating fried rice** must be three houses apart.

6. **Person wearing high heels and person eating grilled cheese** must be adjacent, with the high heels to the left.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. The people play different sports and like different kinds of books. Here are the clues:

1. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. The history book buff lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

From clue 3, the history book buff lives in the first house. So, the arrangement is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

Now, clue 1 tells us that there is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives. This means the science fiction book fanatic can't live in the first or third house because there would be no house between them and the swimmer. So, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Now, the swimmer must live in the first or third house. But since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the swimmer must live in the first house.

So, the swimmer lives in the first house.

The number of the house where the swimmer lives is (A) 1."

From the above deductions, we can see that the person who had stew is not mentioned in any clue. However, since the person who had stew is not in any specific house, and we have filled all the other houses, the person who had stew must be in the remaining house, which is House 1.

So, the person who had stew lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues and see where the person who ate fried rice might be.

We have two houses, and each house has a person. Here are the clues again:
1. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

We also know:
- One person ate fried rice and one ate spaghetti.
- One person has a cat and one has horses.
- One person likes history books and one likes romance books.
- One person wears sandals and one wears running shoes.

Let's think about the possible positions for the person who ate spaghetti and the person who owns horses.

### Clue 1: Sandals and Horses
- If the person in House 1 (Person 1) wears sandals, then the person in House 2 (Person 2) must own horses.
- If the person in House 2 (Person 2) wears sandals, then the person in House 1 (Person 1) must own horses.

### Clue 2: History Book Buff
- The history book buff must be to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.

### Possible Arrangements:
1. **Person 1 (House 1) owns horses, Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals:**
   - Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the history book buff (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the cat lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the romance book lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing running shoes (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals (Clue 1).

2. **Person 2 (House 2) owns horses, Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals:**
   - Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the history book buff (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the cat lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the romance book lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing running shoes (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals (Clue 1).

In both scenarios, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is **2**."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. There are two people, and each has different flowers, musical instruments, and cars. We know some clues:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
2. The flutist does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the sedan owner must be in house 1 and the person with the lilies must be in house 2. From clue 2, the flutist cannot be in house 1, so the flutist must be in house 2.

So, the person with the lilies is in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the romance book lover lives.

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.
   - So, house 4 has carnations.

2. The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
   - This means if the swimmer is in house 2, the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1.
   - If the swimmer is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 2.
   - If the swimmer is in house 4, the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 3.
   - If the swimmer is in house 5, the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 4.

3. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.
   - So, house 3 has a rose bouquet.

4. The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the mystery book reader is in house 1, the tennis player is in house 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
   - If the mystery book reader is in house 2, the tennis player is in house 3 or 4 or 5.
   - If the mystery book reader is in house 3, the tennis player is in house 4 or 5.
   - If the mystery book reader is in house 4, the tennis player is in house 5.
   - If the mystery book reader is in house 5, the tennis player is in house 6 (but house 6 is not there).

5. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - This means if the rose bouquet is in house 3, the daffodils are in house 4 or 5.

6. The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
   - So, the tennis player cannot be in house 4.

7. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
   - This means if the rose bouquet is in house 3, the daffodils are in house 2 or 4.

8. There are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the romance book lover lives.
   - This means if the mystery book reader is in house 1, the romance book lover is in house 3 or 5.
   - If the mystery book reader is in house 2, the romance book lover is in house 4 or 6 (but house 6 is not there).
   - If the mystery book reader is in house 3, the romance book lover is in house 5 or 7 (but house 7 is not there).
   - If the mystery book reader is in house 4, the romance book lover is in house 6 (but house 6 is not there).

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Mystery book reader.
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player.
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast.
- House 6: Romance book lover.

So, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is house 6.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{6}\)."

7. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.**
   - Computer in House 5, so cellist must be in House 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

From clue 5, the person who had pizza does not live in house 2. So, the person who had pizza must be in house 1 or 3. But since the golfer is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza (in house 3) must be to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. So, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.

From clue 3, the person who is wearing running shoes does not live in house 1. So, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. The person who owns a sedan must be in house 1 (since the golfer is in house 1 and the person who had pizza is in house 3). So, the person who owns a sedan is in house 1 and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. The person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2 (since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2). So, the cricketer must be in house 1.

"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given.

1. Fried Rice is in house 3.
2. White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.
3. Stew cannot be in house 2 or 4.
4. Stew cannot be in house 4.
5. Green cannot be in house 2.
6. Red lives directly left of Stew.
7. Fried Rice is in house 3.
8. There is one house between White and Yellow.

Let's start by placing Fried Rice in house 3:
- House 3: Fried Rice

Now, let's consider the positions for White and Yellow:
- White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.

Since Stew cannot be in house 2 or 4, and Red lives directly left of Stew, Stew must be in house 1 and Red in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Stew
- House 2: Red
- House 3: Fried Rice

Now, White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4. But since Stew is in house 1 and Red is in house 2, White and Yellow must be in houses 2 and 4.

So, we have:
- House 2: Red
- House 4: Yellow
- House 1: Stew
- House 3: Fried Rice

This leaves house 5 for White.

So, the person who likes white lives in house 5.

From clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in house number 2. So, house 2 is taken by the percussionist.

From clue 2, the person who likes red lives in house number 3. So, house 3 is taken by the person who likes red.

Now we have houses 1 and 4 left. From clue 4, the person who likes yellow does not live in house 2 (which is taken by the percussionist), so they must live in either house 1 or house 4. From clue 3, the basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. This means the tennis player can't be in house 3 (where the person who likes red lives), so the tennis player must be in house 1. This leaves house 4 for the basketball player.

So, the basketball player lives in house number 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person with carnations arrangement lives in.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a different person living in it with different things. Here are the clues again:

1. The person who has a computer lives directly left of the root beer lover.
2. The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
3. The root beer lover and the coffee drinker live directly next to each other.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a phone lives and where the person who has a television lives.
5. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
6. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the guitarist lives.
9. The cellist does not live in the fourth house.
10. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
11. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
12. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
13. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
14. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
15. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
16. The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.

Now, let's think about the clues one by one:

- Clue 7 tells us the person with carnations arrangement can't be in house 3.
- Clue 1 tells us the computer and root beer lover are next to each other.
- Clue 10 tells us the coffee drinker is to the right of the person who likes milk.
- Clue 12 tells us the root beer lover is to the left of the percussionist.
- Clue 13 tells us the root beer lover is to the left of the person with a bouquet of lilies.
- Clue 14 tells us the coffee drinker is one house away from the person with daffodils.
- Clue 15 tells us the person with carnations arrangement can't be in house 5.
- Clue 16 tells us the tea drinker is to the left of the pianist.

Let's try to fit these clues together:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, then the computer must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
- The coffee drinker must be in house 3 or 4 (Clue 10).
- The person with daffodils must be in house 1 or 2 (Clue 14).
- The person with carnations arrangement can't be in house 3 or 5 (Clue 7 and 15).
- The cellist must be in house 4 or 5 (Clue 8).
- The percussionist must be in house 4 or 5 (Clue 12).
- The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 3 or 4 (Clue 13).
- The person with a phone must be in house 3 or 4 (Clue 11).
- The tea drinker must be in house 1 or 2 (Clue 16).

By fitting all these clues together, the only house that fits all the conditions is house 1.

So, the person with carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who drives a minivan lives.

1. We know the saxophonist and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other. Let's start by placing them in houses 1 and 2.
2. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the cat lover. So, if the saxophonist is in house 1, the person with daffodils must be in house 2, and the cat lover is in house 3.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house.
4. The fish enthusiast does not live in the fourth house.
5. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the fifth house.
6. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns a sedan.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.

15. The person who drives a minivan does not live in the fourth house.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person with the vase of tulips lives in.

1. The dog owner lives in the second house.
2. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house.
5. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
6. The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
8. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
9. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives.
10. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.
11. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
12. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
13. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
14. The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.
15. The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
16. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
17. There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's place the dog owner in the second house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: ?
- House 5: ?

The fish enthusiast lives in the third house, so:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: ?
- House 5: ?

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the person who drives a truck, and there are two houses between the truck and the convertible. So, the truck is in House 4 and the convertible is in House 6 (but House 6 is not available, so it must be in House 5):
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio, and the gameboy is not in the second house. So, the gameboy is in House 1 and the radio is in House 2:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The person who has a bouquet of lilies cannot be in the fifth house, so it must be in House 1:
- House 1: Bouquet of lilies
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses, and the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. The convertible is in House 5, so the vase of tulips must be in House 4:
- House 1: Bouquet of lilies
- House 2: Radio
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Vase of tulips
- House 5: Convertible

The person who has a computer must be in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy must be in House 1:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Vase of tulips
- House 5: Convertible

The person who has a television must be in House 3, and the person who owns an SUV must be in House 5:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Vase of tulips
- House 5: SUV

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in House 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the dog owner lives.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:

1. The basketball player lives in the first house.
2. The saxophonist lives in the first house.
3. The person who had pizza lives directly to the left of the dog owner.
4. The person who only drinks water lives directly to the left of the fish enthusiast.
5. The tea drinker lives directly to the left of the cricketer.
6. There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

Let's start with what we know:

- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: ?
- House 3: ?

From clue 5, the tea drinker lives directly to the left of the cricketer. So, if the tea drinker is in house 2, the cricketer must be in house 3. But from clue 7, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk. This means the person who likes milk can't be in house 1, so the person who likes milk must be in house 2 or 3.

From clue 4, the person who had pizza lives directly to the left of the dog owner. So, if the pizza eater is in house 2, the dog owner must be in house 3. But if the pizza eater is in house 2, the cricketer must be in house 3, which means the tea drinker must be in house 2. This would mean the person who only drinks water must be in house 1, and the fish enthusiast must be in house 3. But then the cat lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 3, which doesn't fit clue 3 (one house between the cat lover and the guitarist).

So, let's try the other way around:

- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Cat lover (tea drinker, pizza eater)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (cricketer, dog owner)

This fits all the clues:
- The tea drinker is in house 2, and the cricketer is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The person who had pizza is in house 2, and the dog owner is in house 3.
- The person who had stew is somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk, and this fits with the cat lover and the fish enthusiast being in houses 2 and 3.

So, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

1. **History Book Buff in House 1:**
   - The person who likes history books lives in the first house (house 1). This means house 1 has a person who likes history books and a person who wears loafers.

2. **Cat Lover in House 2:**
   - The person who likes cats lives in the second house (house 2). This means house 2 has a person who likes cats and a person who likes romance books.

3. **High Heels and Daffodils:**
   - The person who wears high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the history book buff is in house 1, the person with high heels must be in house 1. This means the person with daffodils must be in house 2.

4. **Computer and Loafers:**
   - The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person who wears loafers. Since the person with loafers is in house 1, the person with a computer must be in house 2.

From the above clues, we can see:
- House 1: History book buff (loafers)
- House 2: Cat lover (daffodils)

Since the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1 (because house 2 is taken by the cat lover), the answer is:

(B) 1"
"Let's break down the clues step by step to find out where the person who had pizza lives.

1. **Carnations in House 1.**
2. **Apples in House 2.**
3. **Banana not between pianist and pizza.**
4. **Stew and grilled cheese next to each other.**
5. **Piano not in House 5.**
6. **Tulips not in House 3.**
7. **Guitarist not in House 3.**
8. **Pizza to the right of Saxophonist.**
9. **Banana not between pizza and daffodils.**
10. **Pizza not in House 5.**

Let's start by placing the known items:

- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Apples
- House 3: Not daffodils
- House 4: Not daffodils
- House 5: Not daffodils

Since the person who had pizza must be to the right of the saxophonist, and the saxophonist can't be in House 5, let's try placing the saxophonist in House 4. This means the pizza must be in House 5.

Now, let's place the remaining items:

- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Apples
- House 3: Not daffodils
- House 4: Not daffodils
- House 5: Pizza

Since the person who had pizza is in House 5, and the person who had stew and grilled cheese are next to each other, we can place them in Houses 4 and 5. But since pizza is in House 5, the person who had stew must be in House 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Apples
- House 3: Not daffodils
- House 4: Stew
- House 5: Pizza

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."

1. The history book buff lives in the second house.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
4. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
5. The person who likes white lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
7. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. The flutist does not live in the first house.
10. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
12. The guitar lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
13. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.

Let's start by placing the known people:

- Second house: History book buff
- Fourth house: Fantasy book enthusiast

Now, let's place the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who ate fried rice. Since the bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and there is one house between the history book buff and the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
1. Bouquet of daffodils
2. History book buff
3. Spaghetti
4. Fantasy book enthusiast

Next, let's place the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes yellow, and the person who likes white must be to the left of the bouquet of daffodils, the person who likes white must be in the first house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the second house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
1. White
2. Yellow
3. Spaghetti
4. Fantasy book enthusiast

Now, let's place the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who likes blue. Since the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the person who likes yellow, and the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist, the person who likes blue must be in the first house, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
1. White
2. Blue
3. Spaghetti
4. Fantasy book enthusiast

Now, let's place the person who had pizza and the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who had pizza must be in the first house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
1. Pizza
2. Blue
3. Spaghetti
4. Fantasy book enthusiast

Finally, let's place the flutist and the cellist. Since the flutist does not live in the first house, the flutist must be in the second, third, or fourth house. The cellist must be in the remaining house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
1. Pizza
2. Flutist
3. Spaghetti
4. Fantasy book enthusiast

The cellist must be in the third house.

Therefore, the cellist lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the pianist lives.

1. The pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
2. The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Let's try to place the people and fruits based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

**Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

**Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

**Clue 2:** The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
- If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
- If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).
- There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (Clue 4).

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and two people living in them. One person is eating kiwis, and the other is eating oranges. One person likes history books, and the other likes fantasy books. We know the following:

1. The person who eats kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The person who likes fantasy books does not live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the person eating kiwis lives in house 1. So, house 1 is taken by the person who eats kiwis.

Since the person who likes fantasy books cannot live in house 1, they must live in house 2.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. One person lives in each house. We know two things:
1. The root beer lover doesn't live in house 2.
2. The pianist lives next to the cellist.

Since the root beer lover can't be in house 2, they must be in house 1. If the pianist and the cellist are next to each other, and the root beer lover is in house 1, then the pianist must be in house 1 and the cellist must be in house 2.

So, the root beer lover lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

- The third house is not daffodils (since daffodils and running shoes are next to each other).
- The second house is not tulips (since tulips are to the right of daffodils).
- The first house is not sandals (since sandals are not in the fifth house).

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- The person with boots must be in the fourth house (since the fifth house is occupied by carnations and the fourth house is not occupied by sandals).
- The person with boots is in the fourth house, so the person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with sandals is not in the fifth house, so the person with sandals must be in the first house.
- The person with tulips is to the right of the person with daffodils, and the person with tulips is next to the person with loafers.
- The person with running shoes and the person with daffodils are next to each other, and the person with running shoes is one house away from the person with lilies.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the pianist lives.

We have 4 houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We need to figure out the house number where the pianist lives based on the clues given.

- Since the person who likes white is in house 2, green must be in house 3.
- The person who likes green (in house 3) and the person who eats oranges (in house 4) are one house apart, so oranges must be in house 4.

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

1. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
3. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. From clue 4, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots. From clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. From clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or third house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house (since the person who had stew cannot live in the second house).

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who likes white must live in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew.

Now, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots. The person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the second house (Clue 3), so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. Since the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

From clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This contradicts clue 2, which states that the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or second house. From clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: ?
- House 4: ?

Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live next to each other (clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 1 or 3. But the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (clue 1), so the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. One person drinks coffee, and the other drinks water.
2. One person wears sandals, and the other wears loafers.
3. One person likes science fiction books, and the other likes romance books.
4. The person who likes science fiction books lives in the first house (house 1).
5. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who wears sandals.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes science fiction books lives in house 1. So, house 1 has a science fiction book lover.

From clue 5, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 because the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who wears sandals. This means the person who wears sandals must be in house 1.

So, house 1 has the science fiction book lover and the person who wears sandals.
House 2 has the coffee drinker and the person who wears loafers.

Since the only other person left is the romance book lover, and the only house left for the romance book lover is house 2, the romance book lover must live in house 2.

So, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and two people living in them. One person plays the piano, and the other plays percussion. Also, one person has a radio, and the other has a phone.

The clue tells us that the percussionist lives next to the person with the radio. So, if we think about the houses:

- House 1: Person 1
- House 2: Person 2

If the percussionist is in House 1 (next to the radio), then the person with the radio must be in House 2. This means the person with the phone must be in House 1 because the piano player is in House 2.

So, the person with the phone lives in House 1.

The correct answer is:
(A) 1"
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who likes yellow lives.

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - So, the second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them. So, the person who likes white could be in house 1 and the person who owns a sedan could be in house 3, or vice versa.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means the person who likes yellow and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, with the person who likes yellow in the house directly to the left of the person who owns a sedan.

Now, let's combine these clues:

- The second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.
- The person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them. So, if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, the person who likes white must be in house 1. This means the person who likes yellow must be in house 2, because the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step using the clues given.

1. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Running shoes

2. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Sedan

3. The dog owner does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not dog owner

4. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - House 1: Running shoes
   - House 2: Sandals
   - House 3: Sedan
   - House 4: Bird keeper
   - House 5: High heels

5. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing running shoes lives and where the bird keeper lives.
   - Running shoes (House 1)
   - Bird keeper (House 4)
   - Two houses between House 1 and House 4: Houses 2 and 3

6. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Bird keeper
   - House 5: High heels

7. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
   - House 5: High heels
   - House 4: Bird keeper
   - House 3: Sedan
   - House 2: Sandals
   - House 1: Running shoes

8. The fish enthusiast does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Sedan

9. The person who is wearing high heels lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
   - House 5: High heels
   - House 4: Bird keeper
   - House 3: Sedan
   - House 2: Sandals
   - House 1: Running shoes

10. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the fifth house.
    - House 5: High heels

11. The fish enthusiast does not live in the fifth house.
    - House 5: High heels

12. The dog owner does not live in the first house.
    - House 1: Running shoes

13. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
    - House 5: High heels
    - House 4: Bird keeper
    - House 3: Sedan
    - House 2: Sandals
    - House 1: Running shoes

From the clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Running shoes (loafers)
- House 2: Sandals (high heels)
- House 3: Sedan (high heels)
- House 4: Bird keeper (loafers)
- House 5: Minivan (loafers)

The person who owns horses lives in the fifth house.

So, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person who drives a truck lives in.

1. We know the convertible is in the first house, so House 1 is a convertible.
2. The person wearing loafers is in the second house, so House 2 is loafers.
3. The bird keeper is in the first house, so House 1 is a bird keeper.
4. The grapes and fish enthusiast are next to each other, and the fish enthusiast is in House 5 (since the truck is in House 5 and the sedan is in House 3, which is next to the SUV).
5. The sandals are in House 4, and the truck is in House 5.
6. The dog owner is two houses away from the person eating oranges, and the person eating oranges is in House 4.
7. The sedan is next to the SUV, and the sedan is in House 3.
8. The person wearing high heels is two houses away from the person with the bouquet of lilies, and the bouquet of lilies is in House 1.
9. The person with the rose bouquet is next to the person with the bouquet of lilies, so the rose bouquet is in House 2.
10. The person with the vase of tulips is next to the person wearing boots, and the boots are in House 4.
11. The person with the bouquet of daffodils is next to the person with the horses, and the horses are in House 3.
12. The person wearing running shoes is not in House 1, and the person eating apples is in House 4.

So, the houses are:
- House 1: Bird Keeper
- House 2: Rose Bouquet
- House 3: Horses
- House 4: Sandals
- House 5: Truck

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know the following:
1. One person ate fried rice, one ate spaghetti, and one ate grilled cheese.
2. One person likes science fiction books, one likes fantasy books, and one likes mystery books.
3. The fried rice person lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book person lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the fried rice person lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Fried Rice
- House 3: ?

From clue 4, we know the fantasy book person lives in the second house. So, the arrangement is now:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: ?

From clue 2, the fried rice person (in the second house) lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the fried rice person is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the second house. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: ?

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the fried rice person is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Spaghetti Eater
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: ?

Now, the only person left to place is the grilled cheese eater. Since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in House 1 (because the science fiction book fanatic is there) and cannot be in House 3 (because the grilled cheese eater cannot be to the right of the fried rice eater), the grilled cheese eater must be in House 3:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Spaghetti Eater
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: Grilled Cheese Eater

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, house 1 and house 2. In house 1, there's a person with carnations, and in house 2, there's a person with a dog.

The clue tells us that the person with carnations is to the left of the person with a dog. Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person with the carnations must be in house 1.

So, the number of the house where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person wearing high heels lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.
   - If the person drinking water is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
   - This means if the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person liking yellow must be in house 2.
   - If the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person liking yellow must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

Now, let's use these clues together:

- From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2.
- From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2).
- From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

So, we have:
- House 1: Person drinking water, Person wearing sandals
- House 2: Person eating kiwis, Person liking yellow

Since the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person eating kiwis lives.

1. **Clue 1**: The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person wearing sandals can't be in house 2 (the right house), because there's no house to the right of house 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person wearing sandals can't be in house 2, they must be in house 1 (the left house).
   - Therefore, the person eating grapes must be in house 1 as well, because they live next to the person wearing sandals.

3. **Clue 3**: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - Since the person eating grapes is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 1 (because the tea drinker cannot be in house 2).
   - This means the person with the television must be in house 2.

Now, let's summarize what we know:
- House 1: Person eating grapes, tea drinker
- House 2: Person wearing high heels, person with a phone, person drinking water, person eating kiwis

Since the person eating grapes is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who is eating kiwis lives is **2**."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the guitarist lives.

1. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
2. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
4. The violinist does not live in the third house.

From clue 3, we know the tea drinker lives in house 1. So, the tea drinker is in house 1.

Now, let's use clue 1. The person who only drinks water must be in house 2 or 3 because they live to the right of the cellist. If the cellist is in house 2, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. But from clue 4, the violinist cannot be in house 3. So, the cellist must be in house 3, and the person who only drinks water must be in house 2.

Now we know:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Person who only drinks water
- House 3: Cellist

From clue 2, there is one house between where the violinist lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the cellist is in house 3, the violinist must be in house 2 or house 1. But house 1 is taken by the tea drinker, so the violinist must be in house 2. This means the guitarist must be in house 3.

So, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

1. The person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.
   - So, the third house is occupied by someone wearing sandals.

2. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the first house is occupied by someone else.

3. The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing sandals lives in the third house.

4. The tea drinker lives in the fifth house.
   - So, the fifth house is occupied by the tea drinker.

5. There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5.

6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person who only drinks water cannot be in the fifth house (where the tea drinker lives), and the person who is wearing boots cannot be in the first house.

7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
   - So, the third house is occupied by someone who likes milk.

Now, let's put it all together:
- Third house: Someone who likes milk (Clue 7)
- Third house: Someone wearing sandals (Clue 1)
- Fourth house: Someone who only drinks water (Clue 3)
- Fifth house: Someone who drinks tea (Clue 4)
- First house: Someone who is not wearing running shoes (Clue 2)
- Second house: Someone who is not the coffee drinker or the person who is wearing loafers (Clue 5)
- Fourth house: Someone who only drinks water (Clue 3)
- Fifth house: Someone who drinks tea (Clue 4)

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who is wearing boots
- Second house: Person who is wearing running shoes
- Third house: Person who likes milk (and wearing sandals)
- Fourth house: Person who only drinks water
- Fifth house: Person who drinks tea

Therefore, the person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person who had pizza lives in house 4.
2. The person who has a computer does not live in house 4, so the computer could be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.
3. The person who has a radio does not live in house 4, so the radio could be in houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.
4. The person who has a gameboy and the person who has a computer live next to each other.
5. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
6. There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
7. There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

Let's start by placing the pizza in house 4:
- House 4: Pizza

Now, let's place the computer and radio:
- The computer cannot be in house 4, so it must be in one of houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, numbered 1 and 2. One person lives in each house. We know the following:

- One person is a percussionist and plays a different musical instrument.
- One person ate grilled cheese for lunch.
- One person has a pet, either a dog or a bird.

We also have two clues:
1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.

From clue 1, we know:
- The bird keeper and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in the same house.
- Since the bird keeper can't be in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1.
- Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The percussionist can't be in house 2.

So, the percussionist must be in house 1.

Now we know:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese

This leaves the guitarist and the person who had pizza to be in houses 1 and 2. Since the percussionist is in house 1 and the grilled cheese eater is in house 2, the guitarist and the pizza eater must be in the remaining houses.

Since the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2 (because the guitarist can't be in house 1, and the pizza eater can't be in house 2).

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the bird keeper lives.

1. We know the bird keeper lives in house number 3 from clue 2.
2. The cat lover can't be in house 2, so they can be in house 1, 3, or 4.
3. The golfer and the truck driver can't be in adjacent houses.
4. The convertible driver can't be in house 1, so they can be in house 2, 3, or 4.
5. The baseball player can't be in house 3, so they can be in house 1, 2, or 4.
6. The convertible driver can't be in house 3, which is consistent with clue 5.
7. The sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player.
8. The soccer player can't be in house 3, so they can be in house 1, 2, or 4.
9. The fish enthusiast can't be in house 3, so they can be in house 1, 2, or 4.
10. The fish enthusiast must be to the left of the soccer player.

Let's place the bird keeper in house 3. Now we need to fit the rest of the clues:

- Convertible driver can't be in house 3, so they can be in house 1 or 2.
- Baseball player can't be in house 3, so they can be in house 1, 2, or 4.
- Sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player.
- Soccer player can't be in house 3, so they can be in house 1, 2, or 4.
- Fish enthusiast can't be in house 3, so they can be in house 1, 2, or 4.

If we put the convertible driver in house 1, the baseball player can be in house 2 (since they can't be in house 3). The sedan owner must be in house 4 (to the right of the baseball player). The fish enthusiast can be in house 2 (to the left of the soccer player), but house 2 is already taken by the baseball player. So the fish enthusiast must be in house 1, but house 1 is taken by the convertible driver. This doesn't work.

If we put the convertible driver in house 2, the baseball player can be in house 1 or 4. If the baseball player is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 4. The fish enthusiast can be in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the convertible driver), so the fish enthusiast must be in house 4. This leaves house 3 for the bird keeper, which works.

So, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

The answer is (A) 3."

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person eating kiwis lives.

1. We know the person eating grapes is in house 2.
2. The person who likes red and the person who likes green live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1 and the person who likes red must be in house 3.
3. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who eats a banana lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who eats a banana must be in houses 1 and 3 or houses 2 and 4. But since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who eats a banana must be in house 3.
4. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes yellow must be in house 4.
5. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This confirms that the person who likes white is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3.
6. The person who eats a banana is in house 3, and the person who likes white is in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: White
- House 2: Grapes
- House 3: Red
- House 4: Kiwis

Therefore, the person who eats kiwis lives in house 4. The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have two houses, and we need to figure out which house the person who had stew lives in. Here are the clues again:

1. The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.
2. The mystery book reader lives next to the cat lover.
3. The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live next to each other.

Let's think about it:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1, then the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2 because the running shoes person has to be to the right of the oranges person.
- If the person eating oranges is in house 1, the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be next to each other. And since the mystery book reader and the person who had stew are next to each other, and the mystery book reader is next to the cat lover, the only place left for the cat lover is house 3.
- So, the person who had stew must be in house 1 because the mystery book reader and the person who had stew are next to each other, and the mystery book reader is in house 2.

So, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."

From clue 4, the person with the TV is not in house 2, so the person with the TV must be in house 3.

Now, from clue 1, the person with the daffodils is next to the person with the phone. Since the person with the daffodils is in house 2 (from clue 2), the person with the phone must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Root beer lover (bouquet of tulips)
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (bouquet of daffodils)
- House 3: Person with the TV (bouquet of daffodils) (but this contradicts clue 1, so this must be a different person)

Since the person with the daffodils is in house 2, the person with the phone must be in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who likes root beer.

From clue 5, the person with the TV (which is in house 3) is next to the person with the tulip vase. Since the person with the tulip vase is in house 1, the person with the TV must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who likes root beer (bouquet of tulips)
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (bouquet of daffodils)
- House 3: Person with the TV (bouquet of daffodils)

Therefore, the person who likes milk must be in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the computer lives.

1. The person wearing loafers lives in the first house. So, the first house has loafers.
2. The person with a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos. This means the phone can be in house 1 or 2, but not in house 3.
3. The person eating grapes lives directly left of the person drinking water. This means grapes and water must be in adjacent houses.
4. The person wearing boots does not live in the third house.
5. The person eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk. This means kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses.
6. The person wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person with a gameboy.
7. The person eating kiwis does not live in the first house.

Let's try to place the items step by step:

- House 1: Wearing loafers (Clue 1)
- House 2: Phone (must be left of mangos, so phone can be in 1 or 2, but not 3)
- House 3: Mangos (must be right of phone, so phone can be 1 or 2, but not 3)

If the phone is in House 2, then the mangos must be in House 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Wearing loafers
- House 2: Phone
- House 3: Mangos

Now, grapes and water must be in adjacent houses. Since the phone is in House 2, grapes and water must be in House 1 and House 2. But House 2 already has the phone, so grapes must be in House 1 and water in House 2. This gives us:
- House 1: Wearing loafers, Grapes
- House 2: Phone, Water
- House 3: Mangos

Next, kiwis and milk must be in adjacent houses. Since kiwis are in House 1 and milk must be in House 3, this is not possible because House 3 already has mangos. So, kiwis must be in House 2 and milk in House 3. This gives us:
- House 1: Wearing loafers, Grapes
- House 2: Phone, Kiwis, Milk
- House 3: Mangos

Finally, boots must be in House 2 or House 3. Since House 3 already has mangos, boots must be in House 2. But we already have phone, kiwis, and milk in House 2, so boots must be in House 3. This gives us:
- House 1: Wearing loafers, Grapes
- House 2: Phone, Kiwis, Milk
- House 3: Boots, Mangos

The person with the phone is in House 2, and the person with the phone is not the one with the gameboy. So, the person with the phone is the one with the computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.

- The person who likes yellow lives directly next to the person who is eating apples (Clue 17).

Let's try placing the person who likes yellow in the fifth house (House 5).

1. House 1: Green likes
2. House 2: Apples eater
3. House 3: Pizza eater
4. House 4: Yellow likes
5. House 5: Mangos eater

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house (House 4).

Thus, the person who is eating mangos lives in the fifth house (House 5).

The answer is (A) 5."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the saxophonist lives.

1. The radio is in house 3.
2. The percussionist and guitarist are next to each other.
3. The person with a television is next to the person who likes red.
4. There's one house between the guitarist and the person who likes yellow.
5. There are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist.
6. The person with a phone is next to the person with a gameboy.
7. The person who likes green is in house 3.
8. The percussionist is next to the person who likes white.
9. The person who likes red is not in house 2.
10. The person with a computer is next to the person with a phone.
11. The person with a computer is not in house 2.
12. The person with a computer is to the left of the person with a phone.

Let's start with the information we have:

- House 3: Green (person who likes green)
- House 3: Radio (person who has a radio)
- House 3: Computer (person who has a computer)
- House 3: Phone (person who has a phone)
- House 3: Gameboy (person who has a gameboy)
- House 3: Television (person who has a television)

Since the percussionist and guitarist are next to each other, and the percussionist is next to the person who likes white, we can place them:

- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White (person who likes white)
- House 4: Cellist (since the cellist does not live in house 5 and cannot be in house 1)
- House 5: Violinist (since the violinist lives two houses away from the percussionist)

Now, we need to place the remaining people:

- The person who likes red is not in house 2, so they must be in house 1 or house 4.
- The person who likes yellow is next to the guitarist, and the guitarist is next to the percussionist, so the guitarist must be in house 1 or house 4.
- The person who likes red is next to the person who likes white, so the person who likes red must be in house 1 or house 4.
- The person who likes red is not in house 2, so they must be in house 1 or house 4.
- The person who likes yellow must be in house 4 or house 5.

Since the person who likes red is next to the person who likes white, and the percussionist is in house 2, the person who likes red must be in house 1 (since house 4 is taken by the cellist).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: Green (person who likes green)
- House 4: Cellist
- House 5: Violinist

The saxophonist must be in the remaining house, which is house 4.

Therefore, the saxophonist lives in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns horses lives.

1. **Clue 1**: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - The root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, but since the history book buff is in house 1 and the cat lover is in house 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

So, we have:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 3, there's no house to the right of house 3, so this is not possible.

2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
   - So, the dog owner can only be in house 1 or house 3.

3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner is in house 1, the vase of tulips must be in house 3.
   - If the dog owner is in house 3, the vase of tulips must be in house 2 or house 3, but since house 3 is already taken by the carnations, the vase of tulips must be in house 2.

Now, let's see which scenario fits all the clues:
- If the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper must be in house 2 (because house 3 is taken by the carnations).
- The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 (because the dog owner is in house 1 and the vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner).

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the bird keeper lives.

1. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - So, the first house has mangos.

2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - So, the first house is not for horses.

3. The bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in the first house, the person eating kiwis must be in the second house, and vice versa.

4. The person eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - So, the third house is not for bananas.

5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - So, the second house is not for horses.

6. The person eating a banana lives next to the dog owner.
   - This means if the banana eater is in the first house, the dog owner must be in the second house, and vice versa.

From clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in the first house because the dog owner cannot be in the first house (since the person eating a banana lives next to the dog owner). So, the first house has bananas.

Now, the first house is for bananas, so the second house cannot be for bananas. The second house is not for horses (clue 5), and it's not for mangos (clue 1). So, the second house must be for the person eating kiwis.

Since the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other, the bird keeper must be in the third house.

So, the bird keeper lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the romance book lover lives.

1. The romance book lover doesn't live in the third house.
2. The person who owns horses doesn't live in the third house.
3. The bird keeper lives next to the history book buff.
4. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

From clue 4, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house (house number 1).

So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: ?
- House 3: ?

Now, clue 3 tells us that the bird keeper lives next to the history book buff. This means the history book buff and the bird keeper must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the only possible adjacent houses are houses 2 and 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Romance book lover or bird keeper

From clue 2, the person who owns horses doesn't live in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in the third house (since the romance book lover cannot live in the third house, and the bird keeper must be in an adjacent house).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

Since the bird keeper lives in the third house, the romance book lover must live in the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(B) 2**."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house. (Clue 1)
   - So, the coffee drinker lives in house number 2.

2. The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. (Clue 2)
   - This means the apple eater and the water drinker are next to each other, with the apple eater to the left of the water drinker.

3. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house. (Clue 3)
   - So, the mangos eater can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

4. The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house. (Clue 4)
   - So, the mangos eater can live in houses 1 or 4.

5. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. (Clue 5)
   - This means the apple eater must be in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

6. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house. (Clue 6)
   - So, the kiwi eater can live in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Now, let's try to fit these clues together:

- If the mangos eater is in house 1, then the kiwi eater must be in house 4 (since they cannot be in house 3).
- The apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Mangos eater
  - House 2: Coffee drinker (Clue 1)
  - House 3: Apple eater
  - House 4: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The mangos eater is in house 1.
- The kiwi eater is in house 4.
- The water drinker is in house 4.

So, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is house number 2.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person eating a banana lives.

1. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
7. The soccer player lives in the third house.
8. The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
9. The person who likes white lives in the second house.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who is eating a banana.

From clue 9, the person who likes white lives in the second house, and the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house too. This means the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other, and since the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house, the person who is eating kiwis must live in the second house.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house, the person who is eating oranges must live in the first house, and the baseball player must live in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer cannot live in the fifth house, and the golfer must be to the left of the cricketer, the golfer must live in the first house, and the cricketer must live in the fourth house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives (second house) and where the person who likes blue lives (fourth house). This is consistent.

From clue 1, the person who likes white (second house) lives directly left of the person who likes red (fourth house). Since the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house, the person who likes red must live in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who likes white (second house) lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player (fourth house). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who likes white (second house) lives and where the person who is eating apples (fourth house). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From clue 6, the cricketer (fourth house) does not live in the fifth house, which is consistent.

From clue 9, the person who is eating kiwis (second house) and the person who is eating a banana (third house) live directly next to each other, which is consistent.

So, the person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the carnations arrangement lives.

We have three houses, and we need to place people with different characteristics in each house. Here are the clues again:

1. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. The soccer player lives in the second house.

Now, let's use these clues to figure out the arrangement:

- **Clue 8**: The soccer player lives in the second house.
  - So, the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

- **Clue 5**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
  - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the person with stew cannot be in the third house.

- **Clue 1**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
  - This means the person with high heels cannot be in the third house, and the person with stew cannot be in the first house.

- **Clue 6**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
  - This means the person with rose bouquet cannot be in the third house, and the person with spaghetti cannot be in the first house.

- **Clue 4**: The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
  - This means the mystery book reader can be in the first or third house.

- **Clue 3**: The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
  - This means the golfer cannot be in the first house, and the person with rose bouquet cannot be in the third house.

- **Clue 7**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
  - This means the person with running shoes cannot be in the first house, and the person with stew cannot be in the third house.

- **Clue 2**: There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
  - This means the golfer cannot be in the first or third house, and the person with daffodils cannot be in the first or second house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The second house is occupied by the soccer player.
- The first house can be the history book buff or the mystery book reader.
- The third house can be the person with stew, the person with running shoes, or the person with spaghetti.

Let's try placing the people:

1. If the first house is the history book buff, then the second house is the soccer player, and the third house is the person with stew.
2. The person with stew cannot be in the third house, so the person with stew must be in the first house.
3. The person with running shoes must be in the third house.
4. The person with high heels must be in the second house, but the second house is occupied by the soccer player, so the person with high heels must be in the first house.
5. The person with rose bouquet must be in the second house, but the second house is occupied by the soccer player, so the person with rose bouquet must be in the third house.
6. The person with spaghetti must be in the first house, but the first house is occupied by the history book buff, so the person with spaghetti must be in the third house.
7. The person with mystery book reader must be in the first house, but the first house is occupied by the history book buff, so the person with mystery book reader must be in the third house.

This arrangement doesn't work because the person with mystery book reader cannot be in the third house. Let's try another arrangement:

1. The first house is the person with mystery book reader.
2. The second house is the person with rose bouquet.
3. The third house is the person with stew.
4. The person with high heels must be in the second house, but the second house is occupied by the rose bouquet, so the person with high heels must be in the first house.
5. The person with running shoes must be in the second house, but the second house is occupied by the rose bouquet, so the person with running shoes must be in the third house.
6. The person with history book buff must be in the third house.

This arrangement works:

1. First house: Mystery book reader
2. Second house: Rose bouquet
3. Third house: Stew

So, the person with the carnations arrangement lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the percussionist lives.

1. The person with a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Let's start by considering the possible positions for the minivan and truck:

- From Clue 5, the minivan must be to the right of the truck. So, the truck could be in house 1 and the minivan in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 6, the flutist is directly left of the person who drives the minivan. So, if the minivan is in house 2, the flutist must be in house 1. If the minivan is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

Let's try the first scenario where the minivan is in house 2 and the flutist is in house 1:

- Clue 1 tells us the person with a phone must be to the left of the person with the minivan. So, the person with a phone must be in house 1.
- Clue 2 tells us the person with the truck and the person with the gameboy must be next to each other. Since the truck is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- Clue 3 tells us the person with the minivan and the cellist must be next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 3.
- Clue 4 tells us the person with high heels and the person with the television must be next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person with the television must be in house 1 and the person with high heels must be in house 2.
- Clue 7 tells us the person with boots must be to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

So, in this scenario, the percussionist lives in house 1.

Now, let's check the second scenario where the minivan is in house 3 and the flutist is in house 2:

- Clue 1 tells us the person with a phone must be to the left of the person with the minivan. So, the person with a phone must be in house 1.
- Clue 2 tells us the person with the truck and the person with the gameboy must be next to each other. Since the truck is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- Clue 3 tells us the person with the minivan and the cellist must be next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 3, the cellist must be in house 2.
- Clue 4 tells us the person with high heels and the person with the television must be next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 2, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 3. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person with the television must be in house 3 and the person with high heels must be in house 1.
- Clue 7 tells us the person with boots must be to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 3 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

This scenario also leads to the percussionist living in house 1.

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

12. The person eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.
13. The person eating oranges lives in house 3.
14. The person eating apples lives in house 4.

From the clues, we can see that the person eating apples lives in house 4.

So, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is **4**.

The correct answer is (A) 4."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet.
2. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker. This means the SUV driver is in the first house, and the coffee drinker is in the third house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker. This means the person with the rose bouquet is in the first house, and the coffee drinker is in the third house.
5. The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From Clue 2 and Clue 4, we know:
- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The person with the rose bouquet is in the first house.
- The coffee drinker is in the third house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the root beer lover).

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the rose bouquet, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

So, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who drives a truck lives.

1. **Blue and Spaghetti**: The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
2. **Stew and Lilies**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. **Rose and Truck**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
4. **Minivan and Stew**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
5. **Red and First House**: The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. **Minivan and Daffodils**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes red does not live in the first house, so they must live in either house 2 or house 3.

From clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. So, if the minivan person is in house 1, the daffodils person must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From clue 4, the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. So, if the minivan person is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2, and if the minivan person is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 1.

From clue 3, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. So, if the person who has a rose bouquet is in house 2, the person who drives a truck must be in house 3.

From clue 1, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

So, the configuration is:
- House 1: Person who likes blue (rose bouquet)
- House 2: Person who has a rose bouquet (blue)
- House 3: Person who likes red (truck)

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns a sedan lives.

14. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
15. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. From clue 8, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. From clue 9, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. From clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house, so the sedan owner must live in either the first, third, or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must live in either the first or third house.

From clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. From clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. From clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. From clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. From clue 7, the flutist lives in the third house. Therefore, the cellist must live in the second house (since the flutist lives in the third house and they must be next to each other).

Now, let's summarize the known information:
- Second house: Flutist
- Third house: Cellist
- Fourth house: Person who owns an SUV (and also the person who likes white)

Since the sedan owner cannot be in the second house (clue 15) and the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must be in the first house.

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white can't be in House 3 (since there's no house to the left of House 3), so they must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Grapes

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

   - This is already confirmed as House 3.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.
- The person who has a television must be in House 4.
- The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

From clue 1, we know the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

From clue 10, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1.

From clue 8, the bird keeper (house 2) must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (house 4). So, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4.

From clue 9, the person who owns horses lives in house number 4, which is correct since we already placed the person who ate spaghetti in house 4.

Now, we need to place the remaining people:
- The person who had pizza must be in house 3 (since there is one house between the violinist and the person with the rose bouquet, and the violinist can't be in house 1).
- The person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1.
- The person who ate spaghetti is in house 4.
- The person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 (since the dog owner is directly left of the person with the vase of tulips, and the dog owner can't be in house 1).

So, the only place left for the person who has a bouquet of lilies is house 3, and the person who is a saxophonist must be in house 3.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

Next, clue 3 tells us the baseball player and the person who eats grapes are next to each other. Since the person who eats grapes is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1. But we already know the saxophonist is in house 1, so this doesn't work. Let's try another arrangement.

Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the person who eats grapes must be in house 2. Now, clue 1 tells us the tea drinker and the person who eats grapes are next to each other, so the tea drinker must be in house 2.

So, house 1 has the baseball player, and house 2 has the tea drinker and the person who eats grapes.

Now, clue 5 tells us the romance book lover and the golfer are next to each other. Since the tea drinker is in house 2, the romance book lover and the golfer must be in houses 1 and 2. But we already know the baseball player is in house 1, so the romance book lover must be in house 1, and the golfer must be in house 2.

So, house 1 has the baseball player, and house 2 has the tea drinker and the golfer.

This leaves house 2 for the person who eats mangos.

Therefore, the person who eats mangos lives in house 2.

4. The person with the daffodil bouquet lives in the first house.

From clue 3 and clue 4, we know:
- The first house is occupied by the person with the daffodil bouquet and the person wearing boots.

Now, let's see where the other people live:
- The second house cannot have the person with the lily bouquet (clue 1) or the person wearing high heels (clue 2).
- The third house must have the person with the rose bouquet and the person wearing running shoes.

So, the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 5 houses, numbered 1 to 5.
2. Each house has a person with a different lunch, shoes, sport, and drink.
3. We need to figure out which house the tea drinker lives in.

Here are the clues again:
1. The coffee drinker does not live in the fourth house.
2. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
3. The basketball player and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
4. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
6. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
8. The person who only drinks water does not live in the fifth house.
9. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
10. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
11. The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
12. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
13. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player.
14. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing boots. According to clue 13, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player. So, if the person who is wearing boots is in house 1, the basketball player must be in house 2. But house 1 is the first house, and the person who is wearing boots cannot be in the first house because the root beer lover must be to the left of the person who only drinks water (clue 12), and the root beer lover must be in house 4 or 5. So, the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, and the basketball player must be in house 3.

Now, the root beer lover must be in house 4 or 5. According to clue 12, the root beer lover must be to the left of the person who only drinks water. So, the person who only drinks water must be in house 5, and the root beer lover must be in house 4.

Now, the cricketer must be to the right of the person who is wearing sandals (clue 11). The person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1 or 2. Since the person who is wearing boots is in house 2, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1. So, the cricketer must be in house 5.

Now, the person who only drinks water is in house 5, and the cricketer is in house 5. This means the cricketer is in house 5, and the person who is wearing sandals is in house 1.

Now, the person who had stew must be to the left of the tennis player (clue 14). The person who had stew must be in house 1 or 2. Since the person who is wearing sandals is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2. So, the tennis player must be in house 3.

Now, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person who had stew is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3. So, the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 4.

Now, the person who had pizza must be to the left of the cricketer (clue 7). The cricketer is in house 5, so the person who had pizza must be in house 4. So, the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 4.

So, the tea drinker must be in house 1 because the person who is wearing sandals is in house 1, and the tea drinker must be directly left of the person who had pizza (clue 5). The person who had pizza is in house 4, so the tea drinker must be in house 1.

Therefore, the tea drinker lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step, following the clues given.

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Tea drinker

2. The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
   - This means the person who had pizza lives in house 2, and the person who likes blue lives in house 1 (but we already know the tea drinker is in house 1).

3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.
   - House 5: Vase of tulips

4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Bouquet of lilies

5. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice lives in house 3, and the person who only drinks water lives in house 5 (but we already know the vase of tulips is in house 5).

6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 4, and the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 5 (but we already know the vase of tulips is in house 5).

7. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This confirms the previous placement.

8. The root beer lover does not live in the third house.
   - This means the root beer lover can live in houses 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10.

9. There is one house between where the person who liked white lives and where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives.
   - This means the person who likes white lives in house 3, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 4 (but we already know the grilled cheese eater is in house 4).

10. The person who likes red and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.
    - This means the person who likes red lives in house 4, and the person who likes yellow lives in house 5 (but we already know the vase of tulips is in house 5).

11. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow.
    - This means the coffee drinker lives in house 1 (but we already know the tea drinker is in house 1).

So, let's summarize:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Bouquet of lilies
- House 3: White lover
- House 4: Grilled cheese eater, Red lover
- House 5: Vase of tulips, Yellow lover

The person who likes green must be in the remaining house, which is house 6.

So, the person who likes green lives in house 6.

The answer is (C) 6."

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who eats grapes lives next to the person who drives a truck.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who wears boots lives next to the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives next to the person who drives a truck.

We have two houses, and each house has a person living in it. Let's denote the houses as House 1 and House 2, and the people as Person 1 and Person 2.

### Analyzing Clue 3

Clue 3 tells us that the person who likes yellow lives next to the person who drives a truck. This means:
- If Person 1 likes yellow, then Person 2 drives a truck.
- If Person 2 likes yellow, then Person 1 drives a truck.

### Analyzing Clue 1

Clue 1 tells us that the person who eats grapes lives next to the person who drives a truck. So, if Person 1 drives a truck, then Person 2 eats grapes. If Person 2 drives a truck, then Person 1 eats grapes.

### Analyzing Clue 2

Clue 2 tells us that the person who wears boots lives next to the mystery book reader. So, if Person 1 wears boots, then Person 2 is the mystery book reader. If Person 2 wears boots, then Person 1 is the mystery book reader.

### Combining Clues

Let's use Clue 3 and Clue 1 together:
- If Person 1 likes yellow, then Person 2 drives a truck, and Person 1 eats grapes (Clue 1).
- If Person 2 likes yellow, then Person 1 drives a truck, and Person 2 eats grapes (Clue 1).

This creates a contradiction because Person 1 cannot like yellow and eat grapes simultaneously. So, Person 1 cannot like yellow.

Therefore, Person 2 must like yellow.

Now, let's use Clue 1 again:
- If Person 2 likes yellow, then Person 1 drives a truck.

This means:
- Person 1 drives a truck.
- Person 2 eats grapes.

Now, let's use Clue 2:
- If Person 1 drives a truck, then Person 2 wears boots (Clue 2).

This means:
- Person 1 wears boots.
- Person 2 is the mystery book reader.

Finally, we need to determine the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the remaining characteristics are:
- Person 1 likes red.
- Person 2 likes yellow.
- Person 1 eats grapes.
- Person 2 drives a truck.
- Person 1 wears boots.
- Person 2 is the mystery book reader.

The only remaining characteristic is the fantasy book enthusiast. Since Person 2 is the mystery book reader, Person 1 must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 1**.

The correct answer is (B) 1."

From clue 7, the Minivan driver lives next to the Mystery book reader, and from clue 10, the Mystery book reader lives two houses away from the person who had stew. So, the person who had stew must be in house 5 (since house 3 is Green book lover, house 4 is Mystery book reader, and house 5 is the person who had stew).

From clue 12, the Minivan driver and the person who ate fried rice live next to each other. Since the Minivan driver is in house 4 (Mystery book reader), the person who ate fried rice must be in house 5 (Stew eater).

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 5.

3. The violinist lives in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the violinist lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: ?

From clue 3, the violinist lives in the second house, so the violinist is in House 2.

From clue 1, the cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer can't be in House 3 because the cellist would then be in House 3, which would make the cellist to the left of the cricketer. So, the cricketer must be in House 1, and the cellist must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player lives in the second house, the basketball player is in House 2. This leaves the soccer player to live in House 1 or House 3. But we already know the cricketer lives in House 1 and the cellist lives in House 3.

Therefore, the soccer player must live in House 1.

The number of the house where the soccer player lives is **(A) 1**."

"To answer this question, we need to think about the characters Apollo and D'Artagnan. Apollo is a god from Greek mythology, and D'Artagnan is a character from a novel. Since they are from different stories, we can't really say if they could fight each other.

Apollo is a god, so he might have some special powers or abilities. D'Artagnan is a human character who is a musketeer, which means he's trained in fighting.

If we assume that Apollo has some kind of supernatural power, it's hard to say if he could defeat D'Artagnan, who is a trained fighter. But if we think about it in a more realistic way, a god might be too powerful for a human to defeat.

So, the best answer would be that it's not certain if Apollo could defeat D'Artagnan.

The French Defense is a way of playing chess. It starts with certain moves that are different from other openings. A four-move checkmate is a very special and rare sequence of moves that can only happen in a very specific setup of the board and pieces. It's not something you would normally see in a game of chess.

So, the French Defense can't be used to defend against a four-move checkmate because it's not part of how the French Defense works. It's like trying to use a special tool to fix a problem that only happens with that tool—it just doesn't work that way.

A strong password needs to be tricky to guess. It should have a mix of different types of characters to make it harder for someone to figure out.

Binary numbers are just 0s and 1s, and the standard alphabet is just letters. If we use only these, we can't make a password that's very strong because it won't have numbers or special characters.

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"No, lunch on the beach is not a good activity to spot the full circle of a rainbow. Rainbows usually appear as a half-circle in the sky, and you need rain or water droplets to make a full circle. Being on the beach might give you a chance to see a rainbow, but it's unlikely to be a full circle."
"To answer this question, we need to know more about Abdulqawi Yusuf's daily routine. He was the Secretary-General of the International Court of Justice, which is based in The Hague. However, we don't have specific information about how often he went to The Hague on a typical work day.

The Hague is a big city, and the International Court of Justice has many important meetings and hearings. So, it's likely that he would go there on a typical work day, but we can't be sure without more details.

So, the best answer is:

(B) No

This is because we don't have enough information to say for sure."

In Sudoku, each box needs to have the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once. Roman numerals only have a few symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, M. These symbols don't include the numbers 1 through 9. So, we can't use Roman numerals to fill the Sudoku boxes because they don't have the right numbers.

So, the answer is:

"To figure out if a 500GB USB device is enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to think about how much space Netflix takes up.

Netflix shows are usually pretty big. If we imagine that one hour of Netflix takes up about 2.5 gigabytes (GB), then 10 hours of Netflix would take up:
\[ 10 \text{ hours} \times 2.5 \text{ GB/hour} = 25 \text{ GB} \]

Now, a 500GB USB device can store a lot more than 25GB. It can store:
\[ 500 \text{ GB} \]

So, a 500GB USB device is more than enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day.

The answer is:
(B) Yes"
"To answer this question, we need to think about the size and weight of the Voyager 2 spacecraft and how much Jon Brower Minnoch weighed.

Voyager 2 was a very big and heavy spacecraft. It weighed about 795 kilograms, which is a lot of mass. Now, imagine a chair. A regular chair is much lighter than that. Jon Brower Minnoch was very small and very light too. He weighed only about 10 pounds when he died.

If we think about breaking something, it would be much harder to break a chair with your body weight than to break a big spacecraft. Jon Brower Minnoch was so small and light that he couldn't even break a small chair, let alone a big spacecraft like Voyager 2.

So, the answer is:

(B) No"

United Airlines wasn't blameless in the worst crash in history. The crash of United Airlines Flight 232 on July 19, 1989, was a very serious incident. Even though the crash wasn't directly caused by United Airlines, the company faced a lot of criticism for how they handled the situation. The pilots had to make quick decisions, and the way United Airlines managed the landing at a smaller airport was seen as a mistake. This made United Airlines look bad, and they had to change how they did things to avoid similar problems in the future."

The answer is:
(A) No"
"Sure, let's think about this.

Beavers have big, strong teeth that keep growing because they chew on wood all the time. Smilodon, the saber-toothed tiger, had very sharp teeth that were perfect for tearing meat. Beavers' teeth are good for gnawing wood, not for tearing. So, Smilodon's teeth would be much better at cutting through flesh compared to beavers' teeth.

So, the story of Jesus and Egyptian myths are not connected."
"The correct answer is (B) No.

Methuselah was a very old person in a story from a long time ago. In the Common Era, which is how we count years from the time of Jesus, people have lived to be very old, but not as old as Methuselah.

"To answer this question, we need to think about the heights of King Kong and the Eiffel Tower visitors.

King Kong is a big character, but in movies, he can be very tall. Let's say he is at a height of 30 meters when he climbs.

- The technology and infrastructure for air travel were not as advanced back then.

So, it would be very challenging to complete such a journey in such a short time."

"Sure, let's clarify this for a middle school student.

A student in eleventh grade would not be able to run for president of the United States. The reason is that the Constitution of the United States says a person must be at least 35 years old to be president. Eleventh graders are usually around 16 or 17 years old, which is too young to be president.

So, the answer is:
(B) Yes"

"To answer this question, we need to think about how big each library is. The Library of Alexandria was a very big library, but it was much smaller than the Library of Congress. The Library of Alexandria had a lot of scrolls, but it's not clear how many. The Library of Congress, on the other hand, has millions of books and other materials. So, it would need much more space to store all those items.

Given this, the Library of Alexandria would need less shelf space than the Library of Congress.

So, the answer is:

(A) No"

So the answer is:
(A) Yes"
"Okay, let's think about this like we're in middle school.

Quiet from Metal Gear is a stealthy and smart character, but she's not really a teacher. She's more like a spy who knows how to stay quiet and be sneaky. If we were to pick a lecturer at Haub College, which is about science and nature stuff, Quiet might not be the best choice because her job is more about sneaking around and not teaching.

So, if we have to pick between ""No"" and ""Yes,"" the answer would be:

(A) No

Quiet probably wouldn't be a good choice for a lecturer at Haub College."
"Sure, let's think about this:

Watermelons are grown in places where it's warm enough for them to grow. Brazil is a big country with lots of land where watermelons can be grown. Antarctica, on the other hand, is a very cold place covered in ice and snow. It's so cold there that you can't grow watermelons or most other plants.

So, if we think about it, there are much more watermelons grown in Brazil than in Antarctica. 

The answer is:

"B) No

Silverfish are very small insects, about as big as a grain of rice. They can climb up walls, but they can't jump or fly. The Empire State Building is very tall, much taller than a silverfish could climb. So, a silverfish couldn't reach the top of the Empire State Building."
"No, someone could not theoretically use an armadillo as a shield. An armadillo's shell is strong and protects it from predators, but it's too small and not designed to protect a human. The shell is also not very flexible and can be damaged easily. Plus, a human needs a shield that can move and be used in different situations, which an armadillo's shell can't do."
"Sure! Let me explain this in a simpler way.

Siri, and other virtual assistants like it, are pretty smart but they don't know everything. They can answer simple questions and do basic calculations, but they don't understand complex math like geometry.

So, the answer is:
(B) No"
"No, a thousand dollars per episode for ""Days of Our Lives"" is not preferred to other soap operas. Most soap operas have much lower production costs per episode. ""Days of Our Lives"" is known for its long run and popularity, not for its high per-episode budget. Other soaps might have much lower costs."
"Based on what we know, black-tailed jackrabbits are found in North America, while European wildcats are found in Europe. Since these animals live in different parts of the world, it's unlikely that black-tailed jackrabbits would encounter European wildcats. European wildcats are predators that might hunt small mammals like rabbits, but we don't have specific information about how black-tailed jackrabbits react to European wildcats. 

So, the best answer is:

(B) No"
"A: No

1. **Statue of Liberty**: It's about 93 meters tall.
2. **Statue of Unity**: It's about 182 meters tall.
3. **Lighthouse of Alexandria**: It's about 130 meters tall.

If we imagine all three structures at the same height, the Statue of Liberty would be the shortest, followed by the Lighthouse of Alexandria, and then the Statue of Unity would be the tallest.

So, the Statue of Unity would not be at the same height as the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty is shorter than the Statue of Unity.

Therefore, the answer is (A) No."

If you iron wool, do it on a low heat and use a pressing cloth."
"To answer this question, we need to compare the number of Imams Reza Shah believed in with the number of Jesus's disciples.

Reza Shah, the first monarch of Iran, was a Shia Muslim. Shia Islam believes in 12 Imams, who are considered the rightful successors to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. So, Reza Shah believed in 12 Imams.

Jesus had 12 disciples, as mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible. These disciples were chosen by Jesus to be his closest followers and to spread his teachings.

Comparing the two:
- Number of Imams Reza Shah believed in: 12
- Number of Jesus's disciples: 12

Since both numbers are the same, the number of Imams Reza Shah believed in does not exceed the number of Jesus's disciples.

So, the correct answer is:

"The question is a bit tricky because World of Warcraft is a video game, not a physical object that has weight. A loaf of bread, on the other hand, is a physical object that has weight.

Since a video game doesn't have weight, we can't compare its weight to a loaf of bread. So, the answer is:

(B) No"
"To answer this question, let's think about when these animals lived. Rhinos are very old animals. They have been around for a very long time, even before dinosaurs. Scientists think rhinos first appeared about 50 million years ago.

Mongoose, on the other hand, are newer animals. They started to evolve around 40 to 45 million years ago. This is much more recent compared to rhinos.

So, if we look at when each animal first appeared, rhinos are older than mongoose. This means mongoose came from a later period than rhinos.

"To answer this question, we need to compare the number of people who pass through 30th Street Station every day with the capacity of Dorton Arena.

First, let's think about how many people pass through 30th Street Station. It's a big station in Philadelphia, and on a busy day, lots of people use it. If we imagine a busy weekday, about 100,000 to 150,000 people might pass through the station. On weekends, it could be even more, maybe up to 200,000 to 250,000 people.

Now, let's look at Dorton Arena. It's a big indoor sports arena, but it can only hold about 10,000 people at a time.

So, if we take the busiest day (let's say 250,000 people passing through the station), and we compare that to the 10,000 people that Dorton Arena can hold, it's clear that 250,000 people is much, much bigger than 10,000.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No"

"To answer this question, we need to think about what we know about Düsseldorf and smoggy days.

Düsseldorf is a city in Germany, and like many cities, it can have smoggy days. However, the number of smoggy days can vary from year to year. Some years might have more smoggy days, and some might have fewer.

Without specific information about the number of smoggy days in Düsseldorf for the current year or a recent year, we can't say for sure if it has only a small number of smoggy days each year.

So, based on this, the answer is:

(A) No"
"Sure, let's think about this. An ocelot is a small wild cat that can run very fast, but a kindergartner is a young child who is still learning to run. Even if a kindergartner runs their fastest, it's not going to be as fast as an ocelot. So, an ocelot can definitely outrun a kindergartner.

The largest ship from Christopher Columbus's voyages was the Santa María, which was about 55 meters long. The Statue of Liberty is much bigger, standing at about 46 meters tall, including its pedestal.

Since the ship is smaller than the statue, it wouldn't be able to haul the Statue of Liberty. So, the answer is:

(A) No"
"The question is a bit confusing because ""Holy Land"" can mean different things depending on the religion. If we're talking about the Land of Israel, which is a place of great religious significance, it's not clear if it belonged to Adamu's tribe. Adamu could be a person from a different culture or time period, and we don't know which Adamu we're talking about.

So, without more information, I would say:

(B) No

This is because we don't have enough details to know if the Holy Land belonged to Adamu's tribe."

"Sure, let's think about this!

Carl Friedrich Gauss was a very smart person, but we don't know for sure if his brain was different from a normal brain. The story goes that his brain was bigger than usual, but that doesn't mean it was abnormal. It's just that he had a special brain that helped him do amazing math and science stuff.

So, to answer the question: Did Gauss have a normal brain structure?

(A) No

This is because his brain was described as being larger than average, which is different from a normal brain."

"To answer this question, we need to think about who did more killings. Don King is a famous boxing promoter, but there's no information that he personally killed anyone. Charles Manson, on the other hand, was involved in a series of murders, including the famous Tate-LaBianca murders in 1969-1971, where he and his followers killed seven people.

So, Charles Manson did more killings than Don King in 1971.

The answer is:
(B) No"
"Sure, let's think about this.

In the story of The Wizard of Oz, the Scarecrow wanted a brain because he thought he was stupid. But in real life, a person with Cerebral Palsy doesn't necessarily mean they're stupid. They just have trouble moving their body in certain ways.

So, the answer is:
(A) No"

Marvel's Gateway sounds pretty cool, but the TARDIS from Doctor Who is really special. It's like a spaceship that can go anywhere and anytime, and it's part of a whole series of adventures. So, the Gateway might be jealous of the TARDIS because it's so famous and has so many stories about it."
"Sure, let's think about this.

""JAG"" has 191 episodes. If you watch one episode every day, it would take you 191 days to watch all of them. 

Now, if we divide 191 days by the number of days in a month (which is about 30 days), we get:

191 ÷ 30 = 6.37 months.

So, it would take you a little more than 6 months to watch all of ""JAG"". 

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"
"Sure, let's think about this.

The small intestine is very good at breaking down food, but it's not designed to break down things like cotton balls. The cotton ball is not food, so the small intestine won't try to break it down. Instead, it might get stuck or cause problems in the digestive system.

So, the answer is:
(A) No"
"Okay, let's think about this. The question is asking if children should be kept away from ""special brownies."" Without knowing what these special brownies are, it's hard to say for sure. But if these brownies are something that might not be good for kids, like having too much sugar or being too rich, then it might be better to keep them away from children. If they're just regular brownies that are safe and good for them, then it's okay for them to have them.

So, if we're thinking about keeping children away from them, the answer would be:

(A) Yes

But if the special brownies are safe and good for kids, then the answer would be:

"Based on the information given, the richest billionaire in 2020 had a net worth of about $280 billion. The cost of a property in Cambodia can range from $100,000 to $200,000 USD for a small apartment, and it can be much more expensive for a larger property or a villa. 

So, even if we consider the most expensive property in Cambodia, it would still be a very small fraction of the billionaire's wealth. Therefore, it's not too expensive for the richest billionaire to own a property in Cambodia.

The answer is:
(B) No"
"B) No

To explain simply: The 40th president of the United States, George H. W. Bush, was in office from 1989 to 1993. That's a long time ago. The funny cat pictures called ""lolcats"" didn't start until much later, in the early 2000s. So, it's very unlikely that George H. W. Bush would have sent those funny cat pictures to his friends."
"To answer this question, we need to compare the number of states in Ancient Greece with the number of states in the United States in 1900.

Ancient Greece had 13 city-states, which were independent city-states or poleis. These city-states included Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, and many others.

In 1900, the United States had 45 states. This number includes the original 13 colonies that formed the United States, plus the additional states that joined the Union after the American Revolution and the Civil War.

Comparing these two numbers:
- Ancient Greece: 13 states
- United States in 1900: 45 states

Clearly, the number of states in the United States in 1900 was much larger than the number of states in Ancient Greece.

So, the answer is:

"To answer this question, we need to think about what a sofer does and what a vegan diet is.

A sofer is someone who writes or inspects Torah scrolls. This job involves handling sacred texts, which might use materials like animal skin for parchment or gelatin in ink. Gelatin is made from animal products, so using it could make the job not suitable for a vegan.

A vegan diet means avoiding all animal products and by-products. So, if a sofer uses materials that are not vegan, like gelatin, it wouldn't be a good job for a vegan.

So, the answer is:
(A) Yes"
"B: No

Aristotle lived a long time before the House of Lords was even thought of. He was a smart man who lived in ancient Greece, but the House of Lords didn't exist when he was around. So, Aristotle couldn't have been a member of it."

"During the pandemic, door-to-door advertising can be considered inconsiderate. Here’s why:

1. **Close Contact**: When someone comes to your door, they might be standing close to you. This can increase the chance of spreading germs, especially if you or they are at higher risk of getting sick.

2. **Social Distancing**: The pandemic asks us to keep a safe distance from others. Door-to-door canvassing often involves standing close to people's homes, which goes against this advice.

3. **Public Health**: The pandemic is serious, and everyone is trying to follow rules to keep everyone safe. Door-to-door canvassing can be seen as a disruption to these efforts.

"To answer this question, we need to think about the costs involved in each option:

1. **Running for President of India:**
   - This can be very expensive. It might cost a lot of money for things like campaign materials, travel, and security. Even if we assume a small campaign, it could still cost a lot of money.

2. **Buying a new iPhone 11:**
   - This is a fixed cost. The iPhone 11 costs about ₹70,000 (approximately $950 USD).

Comparing these, it's clear that running for President of India would cost much more than buying a new iPhone 11. So, the answer is:

(A) Yes"

An open heart surgery usually takes about 4 hours. That's a long time, right? Now, imagine a ballet performance of ""Swan Lake."" Even if it's the longest version, it still only takes about 3 hours.

So, if we start the surgery at 12:00, by 2:00, the surgery would be over. But ""Swan Lake"" would still be going on at 2:00. 

That means the surgery would finish before the ballet is over. 

So, the answer is:

- **Testing**: People test the plane to make sure it's safe.
- **Rules**: There are rules about how planes should be made and used.
- **Airports**: We need places to land and take off the plane.

All these things need people working together, which means society. So, the answer is:

"The question ""Was Pi an acceptable number of children in 1980s China?"" is a bit confusing. Pi is a number used in math, like 3.14, and it doesn't make sense to talk about it in terms of how many children a family can have.

In the 1980s, China had a policy called the ""one-child policy,"" which meant families were only allowed to have one child. So, Pi, being a number, is not an acceptable number of children in that context.

(A) Izzi.
(B) Helga.
(C) Sam.
(D) Karl.
(E) Patrick.
(F) Lola.
(G) Melissa.

From the sequence of switches, we can see that Gertrude's partner at the end is Eve, but since Eve is not an option, we need to consider the last switch where Gertrude switches with Eve, and the only logical final partner for Gertrude is the one that fits the sequence of switches and the given options. The only option that fits is:
