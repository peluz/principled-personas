"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The flutist lives in the second house.
2. The person with a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

Let's start by placing the flutist in house number 2.

- **Clue 2** tells us that the person with a vase of tulips must be adjacent to the guitarist, and the guitarist must be to the left of the person with the vase of tulips. This means the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

- **Clue 3** states that the person with a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person with a carnations arrangement. This means the bouquet of lilies and the carnations arrangement must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

- **Clue 4** indicates that there is one house between the flutist (house 2) and the pianist. Therefore, the pianist must be in either house 3 or house 4.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the pianist is in house 3, then the guitarist must be in house 2 (which is occupied by the flutist), and the bouquet of lilies and the carnations arrangement must be in houses 1 and 4. This leaves house 2 for the person with the vase of tulips, which contradicts the clue that the person with the vase of tulips is adjacent to the guitarist.

- Therefore, the pianist must be in house 4. This leaves house 3 for the guitarist, house 1 for the person with the bouquet of lilies, and house 4 for the person with the carnations arrangement. The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2.

Thus, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating kiwis.

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes green lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Green.

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 7**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - This means the percussionist must live in either house 1 or house 3.

5. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
   - This means the person who only drinks water must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the root beer lover.
   - This means the person who has a television must be in a house to the left of the root beer lover.

7. **Clue 1**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the root beer lover must be to the left of the person who is eating grapes.

8. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the cellist lives and where the person who has a gameboy lives.
   - This means the cellist and the person with a gameboy must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4 (but since there are only 3 houses, this is not possible).

Given Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3.

Given Clue 7, the percussionist cannot be in house 2, so the percussionist must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the root beer lover, the person who only drinks water, and the person who has a gameboy.

Since the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3, and the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be next to each other, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: Green (person who likes green)
- House 2: Blue (person who likes blue)
- House 3: Root beer (person who drinks root beer), Gameboy (person who has a gameboy)

Therefore, the cellist must live in house 3.

**Final Answer**: The number of the house where the cellist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
9. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
11. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
12. **Clue 9**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person in the third house is wearing high heels, the third house is house number 3.

Now, let's use Clue 11 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the root beer lover and the person who is eating mangos. Since the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be next to each other.

Given that the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the coffee drinker, and the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3 and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(C) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
   - This directly tells us that the grilled cheese eater lives in house number 5.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who had pizza lives in one of the houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - This means the root beer lover and the person who had stew are neighbors, with the root beer lover being to the left of the person who had stew.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
   - This means the person who only drinks water lives in house number 5.

5. **Clue 5:** The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the coffee drinker and the person who ate spaghetti are neighbors, with the coffee drinker being to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti lives in house number 3.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 5: Grilled cheese eater, person who only drinks water
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 1: Person who had pizza (not in the first house)
- House 2: Person who had stew and the person who likes milk (must be neighbors)
- House 4: Person who only drinks water (not in the fifth house)

Since the person who only drinks water lives in house 5, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in houses 1 and 2. Given that the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are neighbors, they must be in houses 1 and 2.

Let's place the people:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with Clue 4.

Now, we need to place the root beer lover and the person who drinks coffee:
- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2, but since the person who had stew is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
- The coffee drinker must be in house 1 or 4, but house 4 is taken by the person who only drinks water, so the coffee drinker must be in house 1.

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with Clue 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Person who only drinks water (already placed)

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
   - This means the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges.

From Clue 1, the soccer player and the person eating oranges must be in houses 1 and 2. From Clue 4, the person with daffodils must be in a house to the right of the person eating oranges, which means the person eating oranges must be in house 1 and the person with daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 2, the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person with daffodils is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 1.

From Clue 3, the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos must be in house 1 (as the swimmer is in house 1 and the person with daffodils is in house 2), the person with tulips must be in house 3.

Thus, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

1. **Violinist lives in House 1.**
2. **History book buff lives in House 3.**
3. **Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone are next to each other.**
4. **Person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.**
5. **Person who ate spaghetti does not live in House 2.**
6. **Person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.**
7. **There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.**
8. **Person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.**

From these, we can deduce:
- Violinist in House 1.
- History book buff in House 3.
- Person with a bouquet of daffodils and person with a phone are next to each other.
- Person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1 or House 2.
- Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone must be in House 2 or House 3.
- Person who ate spaghetti cannot be in House 2.
- Person who ate fried rice must be in House 3.
- Person with a radio must be in House 2 or House 3.
- Person with a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the percussionist.

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist and the violinist is in House 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1. This leaves House 2 for the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips must live in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. **Clue 5:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. **Clue 6:** The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

Let's start by placing the person who lives in the second house (Clue 2). This person is the mystery book reader.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: ?

Next, we use Clue 3 and Clue 6 to place the bird keeper and the fish enthusiast. The bird keeper cannot be in House 1 or House 3, and the fish enthusiast cannot be in House 1. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in House 3, and the fish enthusiast must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 4 to place the history book buff. The history book buff must be directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the history book buff is in House 1, the bouquet of lilies must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Bird keeper

Next, we use Clue 5 to place the percussionist. The percussionist must be directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the percussionist is in House 2, the computer must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Next, we use Clue 7 to place the person who has a gameboy. The person who has a gameboy must be directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the gameboy is in House 2, the rose bouquet must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Finally, we use Clue 8 to place the cellist. The cellist cannot be in House 3. Since the cellist is not in House 3, the cellist must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Now, we need to place the person who has a gameboy. The gameboy is in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy is directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the rose bouquet is in House 3, the gameboy must be in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Percussionist

Therefore, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. This means the person driving a truck must live in house 1 because the person driving a truck is the only other car type left.

From Clue 1, since the person driving a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff, and the history book buff cannot be in house 1 (because the person driving a truck is in house 1), the history book buff must be in house 2. Therefore, the person driving a convertible must be in house 1.

Now, we know:
- The person in house 1 (convertible driver) is wearing sandals.
- The person in house 2 (truck driver) is wearing boots.
- The person in house 1 (convertible driver) is a mystery book reader.
- The person in house 2 (truck driver) is a history book buff.

Thus, the person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing loafers.
3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover.

From Clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

Now, let's use the other clues to determine the remaining houses:

- **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels cannot be in the second or fourth house. Therefore, they must be in the first or third house. Since the third house is occupied by the mystery book reader, the person wearing high heels must be in the first house.
- **Clue 4:** The person wearing high heels cannot be in the fourth house. This confirms the first house is occupied by the person wearing high heels.
- **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing loafers. This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the person wearing loafers cannot be in the fourth house.
- **Clue 5:** The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means the person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses.

Given these constraints, let's place the remaining people:

- The first house is occupied by the person wearing high heels.
- The third house is occupied by the mystery book reader.
- The person wearing high heels (first house) and the person wearing loafers (second house) must be to the right of each other. This means the person wearing loafers must be in the fourth house.
- The person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses. Since the first and fourth houses are occupied, the only remaining houses are the second and third. The person wearing sandals must be in the second house, and the romance book lover must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person wearing high heels
- Second house: Person wearing sandals
- Third house: Mystery book reader
- Fourth house: Person wearing loafers

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as A, B, and C, corresponding to the houses. We need to determine the arrangement of the devices and the favorite colors.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
- **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
- **Clue 3**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Given Clue 3, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes yellow must be in either house 1 or house 3.

### Case 1: The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement would mean:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow
- House 2: Person who has a gameboy
- House 3: Person who likes green

However, this contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

### Case 2: The person who likes yellow is in house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement would mean:
- House 1: Person who likes green
- House 2: Person who has a gameboy
- House 3: Person who likes yellow

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
6. **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are in the same house, which contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, Clue 5 must be incorrect, and the root beer lover does not live in the third house. This means the root beer lover must live in one of the other houses.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. So, the tea drinker must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.

Let's place the tea drinker in the first or fourth house. If the tea drinker is in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house numbers step by step:

1. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (House 1).**
2. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house (House 1), so the fish enthusiast must live in House 2.**
3. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house (House 1), so the person who had pizza must live in House 2.**
4. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
   - Since the fish enthusiast (who likes green) lives in House 2, the person who has a radio must live in House 1.

From these deductions:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who had pizza (in House 2) and the person who likes green (in House 2) are already determined, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in House 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in House 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in House 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in House 1 (since the fish enthusiast is in House 2).

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct arrangement of people, pets, books, lunch, favorite colors, and drinks. Let's break down the clues and use them to narrow down the possibilities.

1. **Dog owner** lives in the second house.
2. **Stew** does not live in the third, fourth, or fifth house (from clue 18).
3. **Milk** and **blue** are directly left and right of each other. Since **dog owner** is in the second house, **milk** and **blue** cannot be in the first or second house. Therefore, **milk** must be in the first house and **blue** in the third house.
4. **Bird keeper** and **history book buff** are directly left and right of each other. Since **bird keeper** cannot be in the first house (from clue 3), and **history book buff** cannot be in the third house (from clue 3), **bird keeper** must be in the first house and **history book buff** in the second house.
5. **Spaghetti** lives somewhere to the left of **red**. Since **red** cannot be in the first or second house (from clue 5), **spaghetti** must be in the first house and **red** in the fourth house.

10. **Coffee** lives somewhere to the right of the **dog owner**. Since **dog owner** is in the second house, **coffee** must be in the fifth house.
11. **Pizza** and **fantasy book enthusiast** live directly next to each other. Since **fantasy book enthusiast** cannot be in the first or second house (from clue 11), **fantasy book enthusiast** must be in the fourth house and **pizza** in the third house.
12. **Science fiction book fanatic** does not live in the second house. Since **science fiction book fanatic** cannot be in the first, second, or fifth house (from clue 12), **science fiction book fanatic** must be in the third house.
13. **Yellow** lives somewhere to the left of the **romance book lover**. Since **romance book lover** is in the second house, **yellow** must be in the first house.
14. **Tea** lives directly left of the **white**. Since **tea** is already in the first house, **white** must be in the second house.

### Final Arrangement

- **House 1**: Yellow, Tea, Stew
- **House 2**: White, Romance book lover, Root beer
- **House 3**: Science fiction book fanatic, Pizza, Fish enthusiast
- **House 4**: Fantasy book enthusiast, Horses, Spaghetti
- **House 5**: Coffee, Dog owner, Milk

From the final arrangement, we can see that the person who only drinks water lives in the **first house**.

Thus, the answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The flutist lives in the first house.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
9. **Clue 10:** The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
11. **Clue 12:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
12. **Clue 13:** The cat lover lives in the first house.

From Clue 8, we know the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house, we can write:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house. Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 1, 3, or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person eating kiwis is in the first house, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 5, the flutist lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis.

From Clue 6, the person who likes milk does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 7, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house. Therefore, the person who likes milk must live in either house 2 or 4.

From Clue 13, the cat lover lives in the first house. Since the first house is occupied by the person eating kiwis, the cat lover must be the person eating kiwis, which contradicts Clue 13. Therefore, the cat lover must be in a different house.

Let's summarize the constraints:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis
- House 2: Person drinking water
- House 3: Person drinking milk
- House 4: Person drinking root beer

From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges must live in either house 3 or 4.

From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water must live in either house 2 or 4.

Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 2. The person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who likes milk must live in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is eating oranges must live in house 4.

So, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Rose bouquet and grilled cheese are adjacent.**
2. **Oranges and apples are adjacent.**
3. **Tulips are not in house 5.**
4. **Grilled cheese and stew are adjacent.**
5. **Daffodils are not in house 5.**
6. **Pizza is directly left of grilled cheese.**
7. **Grilled cheese is to the right of spaghetti.**
8. **Grilled cheese and tulips are adjacent.**
9. **There are two houses between where the person who eats oranges lives and where the person who eats kiwis lives.**
10. **Oranges are to the right of carnations.**
11. **Apples are to the left of mangos.**

From Clue 6 and Clue 4, grilled cheese and pizza must be in houses 1 and 2. From Clue 8 and Clue 4, grilled cheese and tulips must be in houses 1 and 2. From Clue 7 and Clue 4, grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in houses 1 and 2. From Clue 4, grilled cheese and stew must be in houses 1 and 2.

Given these constraints, the only possible arrangement for grilled cheese and pizza, grilled cheese and tulips, grilled cheese and spaghetti, and grilled cheese and stew is in houses 1 and 2.

Next, let's place the other items:

- **Grilled cheese in house 1, pizza in house 2.**
- **Tulips cannot be in house 5, so they must be in house 3, 4, or 5.**
- **Stew must be adjacent to grilled cheese, so it must be in house 2 or 3. Since pizza is in house 2, stew must be in house 3.**
- **Spaghetti must be to the right of grilled cheese, so it must be in house 3.**
- **Tulips cannot be in house 5, so they must be in house 4 or 5.**
- **Daffodils cannot be in house 5, so they must be in house 1, 2, 3, or 4.**
- **Carnations must be adjacent to oranges, and oranges must be to the right of carnations.**
- **Apples must be to the left of mangos.**

Let's place the remaining items:

- **Grilled cheese in house 1, pizza in house 2, spaghetti in house 3, stew in house 3, tulips in house 4, daffodils in house 1, carnations in house 2, oranges in house 4, mangos in house 5.**

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues and logical deductions, we can determine the house where the fish enthusiast lives as follows:

1. The cat lover lives in house 1.
2. The person with tulips lives directly left of the dog owner, so the tulip owner must be in house 4 and the dog owner in house 5.
3. The person with daffodils does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 3 or house 4. Since the tulip owner is in house 4, the daffodils owner must be in house 3.
4. The person with lilies lives to the right of the person with horses. Since the horse owner must be in house 3 (as the daffodils owner is in house 3), the lilies owner must be in house 4 (which is already occupied by the tulip owner).
5. The horse owner must be in house 3, and the carnations owner must be in house 4 (which is already occupied by the tulip owner).

Thus, the only remaining house for the fish enthusiast is house 5.

The number of the house where the fish enthusiast lives is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their house numbers step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone lives in the first house.
   - This means the person in house 1 has a phone.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 does not wear boots.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person with horses lives in house 1 and the person with a radio lives in house 2, or vice versa.

From Clue 1, we know the person in house 1 has a phone. From Clue 2, the person in house 2 does not wear boots. From Clue 3, the person with horses and the person with a radio must be next to each other.

Since the person in house 1 has a phone, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots (because the person in house 2 does not wear boots). Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

Now, let's determine the pets and devices:
- House 1: Owns horses or has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots and has a phone.

Since the person in house 1 cannot have a phone (because the person in house 1 has a phone), the person in house 1 must own horses. The person in house 2 must have a radio.

So, the characteristics are:
- House 1: Owns horses, wears high heels, has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots, has a phone.

Therefore, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Grilled Cheese and Computer**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
2. **Grilled Cheese in Third House**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the third house.
3. **Apples in First House**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the first house.
4. **Apples and Boots**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the first house, and the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
5. **Blue and Phone**: There is one house between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who has a phone lives.
6. **Loafers and Computer**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house, and the person who is wearing loafers and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
7. **Pizza in Second House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.
8. **Mangos and Yellow**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
9. **Computer and Phone**: The person who has a computer lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
10. **Grilled Cheese and Computer**: The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.

Let's start by placing the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who has a computer. Since the grilled cheese person cannot be in the third house, and the computer person cannot be in the first house, the only possible positions are the first and second houses. Since the grilled cheese person and the computer person must be next to each other, the only valid pairings are:
- First house: Grilled Cheese
- Second house: Computer

Next, the person who is eating apples cannot be in the first house, and they must be to the right of the person who is wearing boots. The only possible positions for the person who is eating apples are the second or third house. Since the computer person is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the third house, and the person who is wearing boots must be in the first house.

Now, the person who is eating mangos must be directly left of the person who likes yellow. The only possible positions for the person who likes yellow are the third or fourth house. Since the person who is eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house.

The person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the third house, and they must be next to the person who has a computer. Since the computer person is in the second house, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the first house, but we already know the first house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots.

The person who has a phone must be directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the computer person is in the second house, the person who has a phone must be in the first house, but we already know the first house is occupied by the person who is wearing boots.

Thus, the only remaining house for the person who likes green is the second house.

Therefore, the person who likes green lives in the **second house**.

The answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The basketball player does not live in the first house.
2. The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
3. The baseball player lives in the second house.
4. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
6. The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Let's deduce step by step:

- From clue 3, the baseball player lives in the second house. So, the arrangement is:
  - House 1: ?
  - House 2: Baseball player
  - House 3: ?
  - House 4: ?

- From clue 1, the basketball player does not live in the first house. From clue 2, the basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the baseball player is in House 2, the basketball player must be in House 1. So, the arrangement is:
  - House 1: Basketball player
  - House 2: Baseball player
  - House 3: ?
  - House 4: ?

- From clue 2, the basketball player (House 1) lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. Since the basketball player is in House 1, the swimmer must be in House 2 or House 3. But since the baseball player is already in House 2, the swimmer must be in House 3. So, the arrangement is:
  - House 1: Basketball player
  - House 2: Baseball player
  - House 3: Swimmer
  - House 4: ?

- From clue 6, the tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the baseball player is in House 2 and the swimmer is in House 3, the tennis player must be in House 3 and the cat lover must be in House 4. This leaves the fish enthusiast to be in House 4. So, the arrangement is:
  - House 1: Basketball player
  - House 2: Baseball player
  - House 3: Swimmer
  - House 4: Cat lover

- From clue 5, the bird keeper does not live in the first house. From clue 7, the bird keeper does not live in the third house. This leaves House 4 as the only option for the bird keeper. So, the bird keeper must be in House 4.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **White and Computer**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
2. **Baseball Player and Blue**: There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. **Sedan and SUV**: The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. **Sedan and Gameboy**: The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
5. **Violinist and First House**: The violinist does not live in the first house.
6. **Guitarist and White**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
7. **Swimmer and SUV**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.

Let's start by placing the known elements:

- **Clue 2**: The baseball player is in house 2, and the person who likes blue is in house 3.
- **Clue 3**: The sedan and SUV must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the baseball player is in house 2, the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 3.
- **Clue 4**: The sedan and gameboy must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- **Clue 5**: The violinist cannot be in house 1, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3.
- **Clue 6**: The guitarist must be to the right of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white is in house 3, the guitarist must be in house 3.
- **Clue 7**: The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who owns an SUV is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 3.

From the above, we can deduce:
- House 1: Computer owner
- House 2: Sedan owner, Guitarist, Gameboy
- House 3: Person who likes blue, Person who owns an SUV, Swimmer

Since the person who owns an SUV is in house 3, the person who likes blue must be in house 3. The person who owns an SUV is also in house 3, and the swimmer must be in house 3.

This leaves the person who likes white in house 3, and the violinist in house 2.

Thus, the soccer player must be in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The cat lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.

8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and is directly left of the person who had fried rice. Therefore, the person who had fried rice must live in the second house.

From Clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live next to each other. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must be in the first and second houses. Given that the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house, the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

From Clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had fried rice is in the second house, the person who had stew must be in the first house, but we already know the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house. This means the person who had stew must be in the fourth house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had stew is in the fourth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fifth house, and the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the bird keeper is in the fourth house, the person who has a television must be in the third house.

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a television is in the third house, the person who owns horses must be in the second house, and the person who has a gameboy must be in the fourth house.

Summarizing the arrangement:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who owns horses
- House 4: Person who has a television
- House 5: Person who had stew

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's carefully deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

2. **Person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.**
3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other, and the person eating kiwis must be to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist next to each other, and the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio next to each other.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, we need to place the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist next to each other, and the person eating oranges is directly left of the person with a television.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Given the constraints, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The answer is (A) 8."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses.

1. **The tea drinker does not live in the first house.**
2. **The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.**
3. **The person who likes red does not live in the third house.**
4. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.**
5. **The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.**
6. **There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.**
7. **The person who likes milk lives in the third house.**

12. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
13. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.**

From Clue 7, we know the person who likes milk lives in the third house. Let's denote this as:

- House 3: Milk drinker

From Clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives in the third house. This is a contradiction because the milk drinker is already in the third house. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the setup.

Let's assume the person who is eating apples lives in the second house:

- House 2: Person who is eating apples

Now, the milk drinker must be in a different house. Let's try the fourth house:

- House 4: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is eating apples is in the second house, and the milk drinker is in the fourth house. Let's proceed with the remaining clues.

From Clue 1, the tea drinker does not live in the first house. Let's place the tea drinker in the second house:

- House 2: Tea drinker
- House 4: Milk drinker

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. Let's place the person who likes red in the first house:

- House 1: Person who likes red

- House 3: Person who is eating a banana

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the person who only drinks water must be in the third house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the fifth house:

- House 3: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Person who likes yellow

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. The root beer lover cannot be in the first or second house (Clue 1), and the person who is eating kiwis cannot be in the first or second house (Clue 2). Let's place the root beer lover in the third house and the person who is eating kiwis in the fifth house:

- House 3: Person who likes red
- House 5: Person who is eating kiwis

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the milk drinker is in the fourth house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fifth house:

- House 5: Person who is eating kiwis
- House 4: Person who likes milk

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the person who likes red is in the first house and the person who only drinks water is in the third house, this is consistent.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red is in the first house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the second house:

- House 2: Person who is eating apples
- House 1: Person who likes red

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who likes blue is in the second house and the person who drives a truck is in the third house, this is consistent.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who is eating mangos is in the second house and the person who likes green is in the fifth house, this is consistent.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow is in the fifth house and the person who owns a sedan is in the fourth house, this is consistent.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house.

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
5. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's deduce step by step:

- From Clue 1, the tea drinker lives in house 1.
- From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- From Clue 3, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.
- From Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.
- From Clue 5, the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's test the possible positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1 (Clue 5), then the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the placement of each person:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.
   - This directly tells us that the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

2. **Clue 2**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - If the SUV owner is in house 3, the person in house 2 must be the mystery book reader, and the person in house 1 must be the person who drives a convertible.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - Since the SUV owner is in house 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 2. But house 1 is already taken by the person who drives a convertible, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - The person who drives a convertible is in house 1, so the person who is eating mangos must be in house 2.

5. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - The person who drives a minivan must be in house 2 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible), and the dog owner must be in house 3.

6. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
   - The person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible, house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, and house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV). The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 4. Since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, the bird keeper must be in house 4.

7. **Clue 8**: The bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The bird keeper is in house 4, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. But house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to recheck the placement.

8. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - The person who drives a minivan is in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, the history book buff must be in house 1.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1 (since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos), and the romance book lover must be in house 4.

10. **Clue 11**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
    - The person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 3, and the person who is eating grapes must be in house 4.

Given all these clues, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Person who drives a convertible
- House 2: Person who is eating mangos
- House 3: Person who owns an SUV
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1**: The person with a television lives directly left of the tea drinker.
2. **Clue 2**: The person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
3. **Clue 3**: The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

6. **Clue 6**: The person with a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person with a radio.
7. **Clue 7**: The person with a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 7, we know the person with a rose bouquet lives in house 2. Let's deduce the rest:

- **Clue 1 and Clue 4**: The person with a television lives in house 1 and the guitarist lives in house 3.
- **Clue 2**: The person eating kiwis must live in house 3 (since the tea drinker cannot be in house 2 and the person eating kiwis must be to the right of the coffee drinker).
- **Clue 3**: The tea drinker cannot be in house 2, so the tea drinker must be in house 1.
- **Clue 1**: The person with a television (in house 1) is directly left of the tea drinker (in house 1), which is a contradiction. Therefore, the tea drinker must be in house 3, and the person with a television must be in house 2.
- **Clue 5**: The person eating a banana must be in house 1 (since there is one house between the flutist and the person eating a banana, and the flutist is in house 3).
- **Clue 6**: The person with a vase of tulips must be in house 3 (since the person with a radio must be in house 1).

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with a radio, eating bananas, and having a vase of tulips.
- House 2: Person with a television, guitarist, and eating kiwis.
- House 3: Person with a rose bouquet, tea drinker, and eating a banana.

The root beer lover must live in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 1"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.
3. The person eating apples lives directly left of the person wearing sandals.
4. The person eating apples does not live in the third house.
5. The person eating mangos lives directly left of the person wearing sandals.
6. There is one house between where the person eating apples lives and where the person wearing boots lives.
7. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.
8. The person eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From Clue 7, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house.

From Clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must live to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast, so the science fiction book fanatic must live in the fourth house.

From Clue 4, the person eating apples cannot live in the third house, so they must live in either the first or the second house.

From Clue 5, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person wearing sandals, so they must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 3, the person eating apples must live directly left of the person wearing sandals, so they must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 6, there is one house between where the person eating apples lives and where the person wearing boots lives. This means the person eating apples and the person wearing boots must be in houses 2 and 4 or 1 and 3.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the third house, the person eating apples cannot be in the third house. Therefore, the person eating apples must be in the first house, and the person wearing sandals must be in the second house.

This leaves the fourth house for the person eating a banana, and the fifth house for the person wearing boots.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."

3. The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.
4. The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.

From Clue 1, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house (number 2).

From Clue 2, the person who owns an SUV lives in the first house (number 1).

From Clue 3, the flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the flutist lives in the first house (number 1), the person who likes white must live in the second house (number 2).

From Clue 4, the person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house (number 2), the person who is wearing loafers must live in the first house (number 1).

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals must live in the second house (number 2).

The number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is **2**."

From Clue 4, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house (house 3).

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who only drinks water does not live in the first house (Clue 3), the person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who drives a minivan must live in house 1.

From Clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the sedan owner cannot be in house 1 (Clue 2), the sedan owner must be in house 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3. But house 3 is occupied by the root beer lover, so the sedan owner must be in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who is eating apples. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the person who is eating apples must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, so this is a contradiction. Let's recheck the sedan owner and the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 6, the cellist lives directly left of the saxophonist. This means the cellist and saxophonist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the cellist must be in house 1, and the saxophonist must be in house 2.

From Clue 9, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the violinist. Since the person who is eating apples is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 3.

From Clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover

The violinist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct house for the person wearing loafers:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Yellow

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means the person wearing boots cannot be in house 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Clue 3:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - This means the fish enthusiast and the person with a phone must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the person with a television and the person who ate fried rice must be in adjacent houses, but the television must be to the left of the fried rice.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not white

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - This means the person wearing sandals and the person with a gameboy must be in adjacent houses, but the sandals must be to the left of the gameboy.

7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - This means the person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4 or 4 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 2 and 4).

8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not stew

9. **Clue 9:** The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the cat lover must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Grilled cheese

11. **Clue 11:** The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.
    - This means the cat lover and the dog owner must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (but since the cat lover is already in house 4 or 5, the dog owner must be in house 1 or 2).

12. **Clue 12:** The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
    - House 2: High heels

13. **Clue 13:** The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Not red

14. **Clue 14:** The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - This means the person with a gameboy and the person wearing loafers must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

15. **Clue 15:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
    - This means the fish enthusiast and the person with a radio must be in adjacent houses, but the fish enthusiast must be to the left of the radio.

16. **Clue 16:** The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television.
    - This means the person who owns horses and the person with a television must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (but since the person with a television is already in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 1).

17. **Clue 17:** The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.
    - House 4: Blue

18. **Clue 18:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
    - House 3: Not boots

19. **Clue 19:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
    - This means the person who had stew and the person who likes white must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but since there are only 5 houses, it must be 4 and 5).

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 2: High heels
- House 3: Not boots, not yellow, not stew
- House 4: Blue, loafers, not white
- House 5: Grilled cheese, not red, not stew
- House 6: Not white, not red, not stew

Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 5 (since the loafers must be to the right of the cat lover, and the cat lover must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is already occupied by high heels).

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

The answer is (E) 5."
"Given the clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house.
2. The person who has a television lives in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the first house (house 1) has a television. Therefore, the second house (house 2) must have the computer, as there is only one computer and one television.

From clue 1, the person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the first house, so the person with the bouquet of lilies must live in the second house (house 2).

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic (SFF) lives somewhere to the left of the golfer (Golfer).
   - This means SFF is in House 1 and Golfer is in House 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) live directly next to each other.
   - This means PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses. Given SFF is in House 1, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist (G) lives somewhere to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils (D).
   - This means G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D. Given Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

Given these constraints, let's deduce the arrangement:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 2 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
2. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
4. The basketball player does not live in the first house.

From Clue 3, we know the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. Let's denote the houses as follows:
- House 1: Lilies
- House 2: Unknown

From Clue 4, the basketball player cannot live in house 1. Therefore, the basketball player must live in house 2.

Now, let's consider Clue 1 and Clue 2 together. Since the person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist, the person eating apples must be to the left of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must live in house 1, and the violinist must live in house 2.

To summarize:
- House 1: Lilies (person with the bouquet of lilies)
- House 2: Unknown (person eating apples, violinist, or basketball player)

Since the basketball player cannot be in house 1, and the violinist must be in house 2, the violinist must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is **2**.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The tennis player lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

Let's deduce step by step:

- Tennis player (3rd house)
- Grilled cheese (5th house)
- Golfer (4th house)
- Stew (1st house) and Spaghetti (3rd house) (since there is one house between them, and 3rd house is occupied by the tennis player, 1st house must be stew and 3rd house must be spaghetti)
- Pizza (2nd house) and Cricketer (2nd house) (since pizza lives to the left of the cricketer and 2nd house is left of 3rd house, which is occupied by the tennis player)
- Soccer player (1st house) (since the soccer player must be to the left of the tennis player, and 1st house is already occupied by stew)

Thus, the cricketer lives in the 2nd house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house. Therefore, the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house (house 2).
2. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the baseball player must live in house 1.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2, the person who only drinks water must live in house 1.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water, Person who likes white
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (from house 1), Person who ate spaghetti, Person who likes red, Person who plays baseball, Person who wears loafers

Since the person who wears loafers must live in house 2, the correct answer is:

**(A) 2**"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
2. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
3. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as A, B, and C, corresponding to the houses 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

- **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the root beer lover must live in either house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 4:** The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house (house 2). Therefore, the person eating oranges must live in either house 1 or house 3.
- **Clue 2:** The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. This means if the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3. If the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
- **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos. This means if the coffee drinker is in house 1, the person eating mangos must be in house 3. If the coffee drinker is in house 3, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 3.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 3).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 2).

This configuration does not work because the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2.

- If the root beer lover is in house 3:
  - The person who only drinks water must be in house 1.
  - The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1).
  - The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges does not live in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This configuration works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Given that the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

1. **Dog owner in the third house**: House 3: Dog owner
2. **Root beer lover in the fifth house**: House 5: Root beer lover
3. **Person wearing sandals not in the second house**: House 2: Not sandals
4. **Coffee drinker and rose bouquet next to each other**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the coffee drinker and rose bouquet must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
5. **Bird keeper and running shoes next to each other**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the bird keeper and running shoes must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
6. **One house between daffodils and lilies**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the daffodils and lilies must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
7. **One house between horses and lilies**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the horses and lilies must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
8. **Carnations arrangement and bird keeper directly next to each other**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the bird keeper is directly left of the person wearing loafers, the bird keeper and carnations arrangement must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
9. **Tulips and dog owner directly next to each other**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the dog owner is in house 3, the tulips must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
10. **Two houses between water drinker and boots**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the root beer lover is in house 5, the water drinker and boots must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
11. **Water drinker and milk drinker directly next to each other**: Houses 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the root beer lover is in house 5, the water drinker and milk drinker must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

From clue 1, the dog owner is in house 3.
From clue 3, the root beer lover is in house 5.
From clue 4, the coffee drinker and rose bouquet are next to each other, and since the dog owner is in house 3, the coffee drinker and rose bouquet must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
From clue 5, the bird keeper and running shoes are next to each other, and since the dog owner is in house 3, the bird keeper and running shoes must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
From clue 6, the daffodils and lilies are one house apart, and since the dog owner is in house 3, the daffodils and lilies must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
From clue 7, the horses and lilies are one house apart, and since the dog owner is in house 3, the horses and lilies must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
From clue 8, the bird keeper and carnations arrangement are next to each other, and since the bird keeper is directly left of the person with loafers, the bird keeper and carnations arrangement must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
From clue 9, the tulips and dog owner are next to each other, and since the dog owner is in house 3, the tulips must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
From clue 10, the water drinker and boots are two houses apart, and since the root beer lover is in house 5, the water drinker and boots must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.
From clue 11, the water drinker and milk drinker are next to each other, and since the root beer lover is in house 5, the water drinker and milk drinker must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can determine the following:
- House 1: Water drinker and milk drinker (since they must be next to each other and the water drinker and boots are two houses apart, the only possible positions are houses 1 and 2).
- House 2: Coffee drinker and rose bouquet (since they must be next to each other and the water drinker and milk drinker are in houses 1 and 2).
- House 3: Dog owner.
- House 4: Horses (since the horses and lilies are one house apart and the daffodils and lilies are one house apart, the only possible positions are houses 1, 2, and 4).
- House 5: Root beer lover.

From the above deductions, the person with lilies must be in house 4, as it is the only house left for the horses and the daffodils and lilies are one house apart.

Thus, the person with lilies lives in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The tennis player does not live in the first house.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

- The person who likes mystery books lives in house 1.
- The person who likes fantasy books must live in house 2 because the tennis player lives in house 2 and the tennis player plays tennis.

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

From Clue 14, we know the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 4. This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 4.

From Clue 1, the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 2, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 3, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This means the person who had stew cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 4, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. This means the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 5, the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other. This means the person who had pizza cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 6, the person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes. This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist. This means the guitarist cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 8, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist. This means the pianist cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 9, there are two houses between where the person who likes green lives and where the pianist lives. This means the pianist cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 10, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist. This means the pianist cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who had pizza cannot be in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person eating grapes must live in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - Since the baseball player lives in the second house, the person eating grapes must also live in the second house. This is consistent with Clue 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - Since the person eating grapes lives in the second house, the person driving a convertible must also live in the second house.

From these clues, we can conclude:
- The person eating grapes lives in the second house.
- The person driving a convertible lives in the second house.
- The person eating mangos must live in the first house (since the person eating grapes lives in the second house and the person driving a convertible lives in the second house).

Therefore, the person eating mangos lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes blue is in house number 2.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Since the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 3. But since the person who likes blue is to the left of the person who is eating kiwis, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person who is eating apples is in house 1 and the person who is eating oranges is in house 3. But we already know the person who likes blue is in house 2, so the person who is eating oranges must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 1**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
   - The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since the person who likes blue is in house 2 and the person who likes white must be in house 3).
   - Therefore, the person who likes white must be in house 3.

Thus, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the root beer lover must be in house 2.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 3 (but there is no house 3, so this is not possible).

2. **The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the soccer player and the mystery book reader must be in adjacent houses, with the soccer player in house 1 and the mystery book reader in house 2, or vice versa.

3. **The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.**
   - This means the person with the gameboy must be in house 1, and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

From clue 3, we know:
- The person with the gameboy is in house 1.
- The mystery book reader is in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The soccer player is in house 1 (since the mystery book reader is in house 2).

From clue 1, we know:
- The root beer lover must be in house 2 (since the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, and the root beer lover is to the right of the person with the rose bouquet).

So, we have:
- House 1: Soccer player, Gameboy
- House 2: Mystery book reader, Root beer, Rose bouquet

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
2. **Clue 2:** There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. **Clue 5:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the people as Cat Lover, Fish Enthusiast, Horse Owner, and Dog Owner.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**From Clue 4:**
- The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
- This means the fish enthusiast and the dog owner must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 2:**
- There are two houses between the truck and the dog owner.
- This means the truck and the dog owner cannot be in the first or last house. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

**From Clue 3:**
- The truck lives directly left of the sedan.
- This means the truck and the sedan must be in adjacent houses.

**From Clue 1:**
- The minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
- This means the minivan cannot be in the first house.

**From Clue 5:**
- The cat lover does not live in the second house.
- This means the cat lover must live in either the first or the fourth house.

### Combining Clues:

Let's test the possible positions for the dog owner and the truck:

1. **Dog owner in house 3:**
   - Truck must be in house 2 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 4 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 2 and the dog owner is in house 3).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration works:
   - House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
   - House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
   - House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
   - House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

2. **Dog owner in house 4:**
   - Truck must be in house 3 (since there are two houses between the truck and the dog owner).
   - This leaves house 2 for the sedan and house 1 for the minivan.
   - The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since the truck is in house 3 and the dog owner is in house 4).
   - The cat lover must be in house 1 (since the minivan is in house 1 and the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

   This configuration does not work because the cat lover cannot be in house 1 (Clue 5).

Therefore, the only valid configuration is:
- House 1: Cat Lover (minivan)
- House 2: Fish Enthusiast (truck)
- House 3: Dog Owner (sedan)
- House 4: Horse Owner (sedan)

Thus, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - This means the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow.

2. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer.

3. **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3.

4. **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - Since the person who likes yellow is in the third house, the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3.

5. **Clue 4**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water.

Given these constraints, let's place the people in the houses:
- House 1: Only drinks water (let's call this person ""W"")
- House 2: Likes root beer (let's call this person ""R"")
- House 3: Likes yellow (let's call this person ""Y"")
- House 4: Likes blue (let's call this person ""B"")

Since the person who likes blue (B) must be in a house number greater than 3, and the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3, the only possible house for the person who likes blue is House 4.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who likes blue lives in the second house (house 2).
2. **Clue 1**: The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
3. **Clue 2**: The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
4. **Clue 4**: The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
5. **Clue 5**: The person wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
6. **Clue 3**: The person eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
7. **Clue 7**: The person wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating grapes.

Given Clue 6, we know:
- House 2: Person who likes blue.

Given Clue 1, the cricketer must be in house 3 (since house 2 is taken by the person who likes blue).

Given Clue 5, the person wearing sandals must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer and the person wearing sandals).

Given Clue 4, the dog owner must be in house 1 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer and the person wearing sandals).

Given Clue 2, the baseball player must be in house 1 (since house 1 is taken by the dog owner).

Given Clue 3, the person eating grapes must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer, person wearing sandals, and person eating grapes).

Given Clue 7, the person wearing loafers must be in house 3 (since house 3 is taken by the cricketer, person wearing sandals, and person eating grapes).

Thus, the bird keeper must be in house 1, as it is the only house left.

The bird keeper lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

3. **Clue 13:** The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 8:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
5. **Clue 17:** The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker, so the cellist lives in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 18:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer, so the grilled cheese eater lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 14:** The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.
9. **Clue 16:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
10. **Clue 15:** The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the swimmer.
11. **Clue 9:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.

16. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
17. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses lives in the first house.

From Clue 2, the person who owns horses lives in the first house. From Clue 12, the coffee drinker lives in the fifth house. From Clue 13, the cricketer lives in the fourth house. This means the cricketer and the dog owner are in the same house, which is the fourth house.

From Clue 14, the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper. This means the bird keeper and the tennis player are in adjacent houses, with the bird keeper to the right of the tennis player.

From Clue 16, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk. This means the root beer lover and the person who likes milk are in adjacent houses, with the root beer lover to the left of the person who likes milk.

From Clue 17, the cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker. Since the coffee drinker lives in the fifth house, the cellist must live in the fourth house. However, the fourth house is already occupied by the cricketer. This means the cellist must live in the third house.

From Clue 1, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the golfer. Since the bird keeper and the tennis player are adjacent and the cricketer is in the fourth house, the golfer must be in the first house. This means the bird keeper must be in the second house.

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Since the cellist and the person with the gameboy are neighbors and the cellist is to the left of the person with the gameboy, they must occupy adjacent houses.
- The dog owner cannot be in house 1, so the dog owner must be in house 2.

Considering the possible positions for the cellist and the person with the gameboy:

- If the cellist is in house 2, then the person with the gameboy must be in house 1.

- Cellist in house 1
- Gameboy owner in house 2

- The green liker cannot be in House 4 (since the grilled cheese eater is there).
- The green liker cannot be in House 2 (since the pizza eater is there).
- The green liker must be in House 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"To determine the house where the person who likes red lives, let's re-evaluate the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.
   - The dog owner lives in the third house (Clue 4), so the person who is wearing high heels must live in either the first or second house.

2. **Clue 11**: The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - The person who is wearing loafers cannot live in the first house (Clue 7), so they must live in the second or third house.

   - Since the person who likes white lives in the fourth house, the person who likes yellow must live in the first house.

9. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.
   - The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, so the person who likes red must live in the second house.

12. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
    - The person who owns a sedan must live in the first house (Clue 13), so the person who likes milk must live in the third house (Clue 9).

13. **Clue 4**: The dog owner lives in the third house.
    - This is consistent with Clue 2 and Clue 10.

14. **Clue 1**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the fourth house.

### Conclusion:
The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in **House 1**.

Thus, the answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. The soccer player lives in the third house.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.

Given these clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

- Since the soccer player lives in house number 3, the possible houses for the golfer and the basketball player are houses 1 and 2.
- From clue 1, the golfer and the basketball player are adjacent, and the golfer is to the left of the basketball player. Therefore, the golfer lives in house 1 and the basketball player lives in house 2.
- From clue 2, the person with lilies and the person who ate grilled cheese are adjacent, and the person with lilies is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the golfer (lilies) lives in house 1, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in house 2.
- From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese (in house 2) lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is already in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must live in house 3.
- From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. Since the third house is occupied by the soccer player, the person with the vase of tulips must live in either house 1 or house 2. But since the person with lilies (golfer) is in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with lilies (golfer)
- House 2: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 3: Soccer player
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 9:** The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who likes green does not live in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 6:** The pianist lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
7. **Clue 8:** There are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives.
8. **Clue 10:** The percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 11:** The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist.
10. **Clue 12:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 2, the fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 7, the third house is occupied by the person who ate fried rice.

From Clue 9, the third house is also occupied by the person who likes red, which contradicts Clue 7. Therefore, Clue 9 must be incorrect, and the person who ate fried rice does not live in the third house.

From Clue 3, the third house is occupied by the person who likes red.

From Clue 4, the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 5, the person who likes green does not live in the fourth house, so the fourth house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 8, there are two houses between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the person who likes white lives. This means the person who likes yellow cannot be in the first or second house, and the person who likes white cannot be in the fourth or fifth house.

From Clue 10, the percussionist and the cellist live directly next to each other. This means they must be in the first and second houses or the fourth and fifth houses.

From Clue 11, the percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the cellist, so the percussionist must be in the first house and the cellist in the second house.

From Clue 12, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. Given the positions, the person who likes yellow must be in the second house, and the person who had pizza must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The tea drinker lives in the third house.
2. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

From Clue 1, we know the tea drinker lives in house 3.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 1. Therefore, the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 4, the person who only drinks water must be in a house with a higher number than the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in house 1, the only possible positions for the grilled cheese eater are houses 2, 3, or 4. Given the tea drinker is in house 3, the grilled cheese eater must be in house 4 (since house 3 is occupied by the tea drinker).

From Clue 2, the person who had stew must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the grilled cheese eater is in house 4, the person who had stew must be in house 2, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in house 2, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Since the grilled cheese eater is in house 4 and the person who only drinks water must be in house 4 (as it's the only remaining option), the person who is wearing high heels must be in house 3.

Thus, the only house left for the person who is wearing running shoes is house 1.

The person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

From Clue 3, the root beer lover does not live in the first house. From Clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio. From Clue 7, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. From Clue 2, the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- First house: root beer lover (since the root beer lover does not live in the first house and the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio, the root beer lover must be in the first house)
- Second house: tea drinker (since the tea drinker must be somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk, and the root beer lover is in the first house, the tea drinker must be in the second house)
- First house: root beer lover
- Second house: tea drinker
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk (since the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels, and the person who is wearing high heels must be in the fifth house)
- Fourth house: basketball player
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Sixth house: person who had stew (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the sixth house)
- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who had stew
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Seventh house: person who had stew
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, and the third house is occupied by the cricketer, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the eighth house)
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers
- Ninth house: person who is wearing high heels
- Ninth house: person who had stew
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese (since the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the tenth house)
- Tenth house: person who ate grilled cheese
- Eleventh house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti (since the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew, and the person who had stew lives in the ninth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the eleventh house)
- Eleventh house: person who ate spaghetti
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From the above analysis, the person with the computer lives directly left of the person with the gameboy. Since the cricketer lives in the third house, the person with the radio lives in the third house, and the person with the loafers lives in the third house, the person with the gameboy must be in the second house, and the person with the computer must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1, and the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).
   - Since the person who ate fried rice is in house 2, the person who ate pizza must be in house 1.
   - Therefore, the person who ate pizza is the science fiction book fanatic.

Given these deductions, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. The pianist lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Pianist
- House 2: Root beer lover

From Clue 3, the person who likes white cannot be in House 2. Therefore, the person who likes white must be in House 1.

From Clue 2, the root beer lover must be to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the root beer lover is in House 2, the person who owns horses must be in House 1.

Since the person who owns horses is in House 1, and we already established that the person who likes white is also in House 1, the person who owns horses (the dog owner) must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
4. The violinist does not live in the fourth house.

7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, we know the pizza eater lives in house 4. From Clue 2, the stew eater lives in house 2. From Clue 3, the guitarist and violinist must be in houses 1 and 3, respectively, with the guitarist to the left of the violinist. From Clue 4, the violinist cannot be in house 4, so the violinist must be in house 3. This means the guitarist must be in house 1.

From Clue 6, the history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist. From Clue 1, the percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. This means the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 (since the guitarist is in house 1), and the percussionist must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives. Since the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 4, and the person who ate fried rice must be in house 2.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

Since the person who owns horses (House 3) and the person who has daffodils (House 2) are next to each other, the person who likes green must be in House 1, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2.

From Clue 8, the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 3. However, since the person who owns horses is already in House 3, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in House 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Likes white, Wearing sandals
- House 2: Has daffodils, Wearing running shoes
- House 3: Owns horses, Wearing boots

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement looks like this:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
3. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
5. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
7. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

From Clue 2, we know:
- The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1.

From Clue 5, we know:
- The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 3.

From Clue 7, we know:
- The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who has a vase of tulips is in house 2 and the person who likes red is in house 1, this is consistent.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: History book buff (Clue 6)

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the person who only drinks water lives in house number 1. From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house number 2. This leaves house number 3 for the person who likes milk.

Now, we need to place the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a rose bouquet. From Clue 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies (in house 2) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 or house 3. But house 1 is already occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

Thus, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
2. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. The person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
4. The cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
6. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone.
8. The tennis player lives in the third house.
9. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
10. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
11. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.

From clue 9, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. From clue 1, the person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house. From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. From clue 8, the tennis player lives in the third house, so the person who likes blue also lives in the third house. This means the person who likes yellow and the person who has a gameboy must live in houses 2 and 4, respectively, because they must be next to each other and the third house is taken by the tennis player.

From clue 6, the person who has a phone does not live in the second house. From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a phone cannot be in the second house, the person who has a phone must be in the first or fourth house. If the person who has a phone is in the first house, the person who has a gameboy would be in the fourth house, but this would violate clue 10 (the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio). Therefore, the person who has a phone must be in the fourth house, and the person who has a gameboy must be in the third house, which is a contradiction. Thus, the person who has a phone must be in the first house, and the person who has a gameboy must be in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing sandals must live in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the third house. However, the third house is taken by the person who likes blue. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the second house.

Thus, the cricketer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
4. **Clue 3:** The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in House 1.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Given Clue 1, the person who likes green must be to the left of the history book buff. Therefore, the only way to satisfy Clue 2 and Clue 1 is if the romance book lover is in House 2 and the history book buff is in House 3.

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in House 1, so they must be in either House 2 or House 3. Since the romance book lover is in House 2, the person who had pizza must be in House 3.

From Clue 5, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 3, which is consistent with the previous deduction.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

The person who likes yellow lives in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes yellow lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

Let's start by placing the tennis player and the television based on Clue 1. The tennis player and the television cannot be in the same house, and the tennis player must be to the left of the television. So, the possible pairs are:
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 3
- Tennis player in house 2, television in house 3

### Case 1: Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Television (V) in house 2

Now, the golfer cannot be in house 2 (Clue 2), so the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3. But since the tennis player is already in house 1, the golfer must be in house 3.

So, we have:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Golfer (G) in house 3

This leaves house 2 for the computer and house 3 for the radio and rose bouquet. Since the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses (Clue 3), and the radio and rose bouquet must be in adjacent houses (Clue 4 and Clue 5), we need to place the computer and tulips in house 2 and the radio and rose bouquet in house 3.

### Checking the placement:
- House 1: Tennis player (T)
- House 2: Computer (C) and Tulips (Tul)
- House 3: Radio (R) and Rose bouquet (Rb)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. Tennis player (T) is to the left of the television (V) in house 1 and house 2.
2. Golfer (G) is in house 3.
3. Computer (C) and tulips (Tul) are in adjacent houses (house 2).
4. Radio (R) and rose bouquet (Rb) are in adjacent houses (house 3).
5. Radio (R) is to the right of the television (V) in house 3.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue and deduce the correct house number for the person wearing sandals.

1. **Clue 1:** The swimmer lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Swimmer

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 5, and the carnations arrangement cannot be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the tulips person is in house X+1.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means if the running shoes person is in house X, the daffodils person is in house X+1.

5. **Clue 5:** The violinist lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Violinist

6. **Clue 6:** The basketball player lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - This means if the basketball player is in house X, the guitarist is in house X+1.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - This means if the high heels person is in house X, the lilies person is in house X+1.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - This means if the loafers person is in house X, the percussionist is in house X+1.

9. **Clue 9:** The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Cricketer

10. **Clue 10:** The baseball player and the basketball player live directly next to each other.
    - This means they must be in houses X and X+1.

11. **Clue 11:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

12. **Clue 12:** There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.
    - This means if the sandals person is in house X, the cellist must be in house X+3 or X-3 (but since houses are numbered 1 to 5, X-3 is not possible).

### Deductions:
- **House 1:** Not possible for violinist, cricketer, or cellist.
- **House 2:** Violinist.
- **House 3:** Swimmer.
- **House 4:** Cricketer.
- **House 5:** Bouquet of daffodils.

Given Clue 11, the daffodils person is in house 5. Clue 12 tells us that the sandals person must be in house 1.

### Final Check:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

The person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

Thus, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
   - This means the fish enthusiast lives in house 1, and the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the second house.
   - This confirms that the person in house 2 ate grilled cheese.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce:
- The person in house 1 is the fish enthusiast.
- The person in house 2 is wearing high heels and ate grilled cheese.

Since the fish enthusiast (in house 1) cannot be the dog owner (as the dog owner must be in house 2), and the person in house 2 (wearing high heels) cannot be the fish enthusiast, the person in house 1 must be the dog owner, and the person in house 2 must be the fish enthusiast (wearing high heels and ate grilled cheese).

This leaves the person in house 1 to have had stew (the only remaining option).

Therefore, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

   - House 6: Person with the vase of tulips

5. **Clue 10:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - The bird keeper must be in house 1 or 2, but house 2 is taken by the person who owns horses.

   - House 1: Bird keeper

6. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - The person with the bouquet of lilies is in house 4 (since house 1 is bird keeper and house 6 is vase of tulips).

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who is eating grapes and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
2. The person who has a phone lives in the third house.
3. The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
4. The flutist lives in the third house.
5. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
6. The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
7. The romance book lover lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic.
8. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
9. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the flutist.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
11. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
12. The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
13. The science fiction book fanatic and the person who is wearing running shoes live directly next to each other.

From Clue 2, the person with a phone lives in the third house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

From Clue 4, the flutist lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the flutist.

From Clue 6, the person who is wearing running shoes also lives in the third house. This contradicts Clue 2, so we need to re-evaluate. Since Clue 2 states the phone lives in the third house, and Clue 6 states the running shoes live in the third house, we need to consider the possibility that the phone and running shoes are different people.

From Clue 1, the person eating grapes and the person eating oranges live next to each other. Let's denote the person eating grapes as G and the person eating oranges as O. They must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

From Clue 5, the person eating oranges (O) lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots (B). From Clue 3, the saxophonist (S) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots (B). This means B must be to the right of S.

From Clue 7, the romance book lover (R) lives directly left of the science fiction book fanatic (SF). This means R and SF must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

From Clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is wearing high heels (HH) lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast (FB) lives. This means HH and FB must be in houses 1 and 4 or 2 and 5 (but since we only have 4 houses, it must be 1 and 4).

From Clue 12, the history book buff (HB) lives somewhere to the left of the person eating oranges (O). This means HB must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 13, the person eating kiwis (K) does not live in the first house. So K must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From Clue 14, the percussionist (P) lives in the fourth house. So P is in house 4.

From Clue 15, the science fiction book fanatic (SF) and the person who is wearing running shoes (RS) live directly next to each other. Since RS lives in the third house, SF must live in the second house.

Now, let's summarize:
- House 1: HB (History book buff)
- House 2: SF (Science fiction book fanatic)
- House 3: RS (Running shoes)
- House 4: P (Percussionist)

Since the person eating oranges (O) must be to the right of the person wearing boots (B) and B must be to the right of S, and O must be to the right of B, the only possible positions for O and B are:
- O in house 4 (since P is in house 4)
- B in house 3 (since RS is in house 3)

This leaves the person eating grapes (G) and the person wearing boots (B) in houses 1 and 2. Since HB is in house 1, B must be in house 2, and G must be in house 1.

So, the person eating oranges lives in house 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the tea drinker.
3. **Clue 3:** There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who had pizza lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who had pizza.

From Clue 8, the person who had stew cannot be in house 3. From Clue 9, the person who had stew must be in house 1, and the person who only drinks water must be in house 2. From Clue 10, the person who likes white must be in house 4. From Clue 6, the person who had pizza must be in house 2, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 3. From Clue 7, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person who is eating apples must be in house 4.

Thus, the person who is eating apples lives in house 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 7:** The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Convertible

2. **Clue 6:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - House 2: SUV (left of history book buff)
   - House 3: History book buff

3. **Clue 8:** The person who is a fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast (left of fried rice)
   - House 4: Fried rice

4. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.
   - House 4: Grilled cheese (right of history book buff)

5. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - House 2: Truck (left of mystery book reader)
   - House 3: Mystery book reader

6. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - House 4: Sandals (right of boots)
   - House 1: Boots

7. **Clue 1:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - House 1: Stew (left of science fiction book fanatic)
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

8. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - House 1: Running shoes (left of high heels)
   - House 2: High heels

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   - House 1: Convertible (left of boots)
   - House 2: Boots

### Final Arrangement

- **House 1:** Boots, Convertible, Running shoes, Stew
- **House 2:** SUV, Science fiction book fanatic, Truck, Mystery book reader
- **House 3:** History book buff, Fantasy book enthusiast, Fried rice, High heels
- **House 4:** Grilled cheese, Mystery book reader, Fried rice, Pizza

The person who had pizza lives in **House 4**.

Thus, the correct answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.
2. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
3. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
4. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
6. The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
7. The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 5, we know the mystery book reader lives in the fourth house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

From Clue 7, the saxophonist lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the saxophonist.

From Clue 6, the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the violinist must be in the third house.

From Clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 1, the romance book lover (in the second house) lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the guitarist must be in the third house, and the history book buff must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is occupied by the romance book lover. This means the history book buff must be in the first house.

Thus, the final positions are:
- **House 1:** History book buff
- **House 2:** Romance book lover
- **House 3:** Saxophonist
- **House 4:** Mystery book reader
- **House 5:** Fantasy book enthusiast

The violinist must be in the third house, as the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.
3. The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.

Let's deduce step by step:

- From Clue 1, the fourth house has a television.
- From Clue 2, the second house has loafers.
- From Clue 3, the second house cannot have a phone, so the person with the phone must be in the first, third, or fourth house. Since the fourth house has a television, the phone cannot be there. Therefore, the phone must be in the first or third house.
- From Clue 4, the boots must be in a house to the left of the loafers. Since the loafers are in the second house, the boots must be in the first house.
- From Clue 5, there are two houses between the radio and the sandals. This means the radio and sandals cannot be in adjacent houses.

Let's place the remaining characteristics:

- The first house has boots.
- The second house has loafers.
- The fourth house has a television.
- The phone must be in the first or third house. Since the boots are in the first house, the phone cannot be there. Therefore, the phone must be in the third house.
- The radio and sandals must be in houses 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since the sandals cannot be in the second house (it's occupied by loafers), and the radio cannot be in the second house (it's two houses away from the sandals), the only possible arrangement is that the radio is in the first house and the sandals are in the fourth house.

Thus, the person who has a gameboy must be in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a gameboy lives is **3**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives in the second house.
   - This directly places the person wearing high heels in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
   - Since the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 2, and we know the high heels person lives in house number 2, the coffee drinker must live in either house number 1 or house number 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes milk must live in either house number 2 or house number 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.
   - This is consistent with Clue 2, as the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.
   - This means the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 3.

Since the person wearing running shoes lives in house number 3, the person who likes milk must be in house number 2 (because the coffee drinker cannot be in house number 2, and the person who likes milk cannot be in house number 1).

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in house number 2, and the coffee drinker must live in house number 1.

So, the person wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - This means the person wearing loafers must live in the second house.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
   - Since the person wearing loafers lives in the second house, the mystery book reader cannot live in the second house. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in the first house.

Given these deductions:
- The person wearing loafers lives in the second house.
- The mystery book reader lives in the first house.

This leaves the history book buff and the person wearing high heels to be assigned to the remaining houses. Since the history book buff and the person wearing high heels must be in the first and second houses respectively, and we've already placed the mystery book reader in the first house, the history book buff must live in the second house, which is occupied by the person wearing loafers.

Thus, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a gameboy (G) live directly next to each other.
2. The person who had pizza (P) lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
3. The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the third house.
4. The person who has a vase of tulips (T) lives directly left of the person who had pizza (P).
5. The person who has a carnations arrangement (C) lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals (S).
6. The person who is wearing running shoes (R) lives directly left of the person who had stew (St).
7. The person who has a television (Tv) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).
8. The person who is wearing running shoes (R) and the person who has a rose bouquet (Rb) live directly next to each other.
9. The person who is wearing boots (B) lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza (P).
10. The person who ate spaghetti (Sp) lives directly left of the person who has a radio (Rd).

Let's start by placing the person who had pizza (P) and the person who is wearing sandals (S) based on Clue 2 and Clue 9:

- Clue 2: P and S must be adjacent.
- Clue 9: B must be to the left of P.

Let's try different placements:

- If P is in house 1, then S must be in house 2 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 2, then B must be in house 1 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P. So, let's try another arrangement:

- If P is in house 2, then S must be in house 3 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 3, then B must be in house 2 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is also not possible because P and S must be adjacent, and B must be to the left of P.

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4 (since they are adjacent and P is to the left of S).
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (since B is to the left of P).

This placement is possible. Let's check the other clues with this arrangement:

- **Clue 1:** R and G live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 4:** T lives directly left of P.
- **Clue 5:** C lives somewhere to the left of S.
- **Clue 6:** R lives directly left of St.
- **Clue 7:** Tv lives directly left of Rd.
- **Clue 8:** R and Rb live directly next to each other.
- **Clue 10:** Sp lives directly left of Rd.

Let's place the remaining items:

- If P is in house 3, then S must be in house 4.
- If S is in house 4, then B must be in house 3 (Clue 9).
- If R is in house 2, then G must be in house 1 (Clue 1).
- If T is in house 1, then C must be in house 2 (Clue 4).
- If R is in house 2, then St must be in house 3 (Clue 6).
- If Rb is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 8).
- If Sp is in house 1, then Rd must be in house 2 (Clue 10).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues. Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of the people living in the two houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The person with the rose bouquet lives somewhere to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2, or the lilies are in house 1 and the rose bouquet is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist does not live in the first house.
   - This means the saxophonist lives in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - This means the person eating mangos lives in house 1.

From Clue 1, we know the rose bouquet is in house 1 and the lilies are in house 2. This matches our deductions from Clue 3 and Clue 2.

Therefore, the person eating apples must live in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is **(B) 2**."
"Given the constraints and the detailed analysis, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(E) 4"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

Let's deduce the placements step by step:

- From Clue 4, the rose bouquet person can only be in house 1 or 3.
- From Clue 2, the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
- From Clue 3, the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:
  - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

    - This means the SUV owner and the person who likes blue must be in adjacent houses.

13. **The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.**
    - This means the first house is occupied by the person who is eating kiwis.

14. **There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives.**
    - This means the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Given the constraints, the only possible positions for the swimmer and the cricketer are:
- Cricketer in the first house (yellow), and swimmer in the third house (blue).
- Cricketer in the third house (blue), and swimmer in the first house (yellow).

Since the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow, the cricketer must be in the first house, and the swimmer must be in the third house.

Now, let's fill in the remaining houses:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV or Person who is eating a banana.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

Since the person who likes green lives in the fourth house, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the first house. This leaves the person who likes green in the fourth house.

Now, the second house must be occupied by the person who likes white and the person who is eating oranges. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (yellow), and the person who is eating oranges cannot be in the first house (yellow). Therefore, the person who likes white must be in the second house, and the person who is eating oranges must be in the third house.

This leaves the person who owns an SUV in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana in the second house.

So, the final arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The answer is (D) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Green and Yellow**: The person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives directly next to the person who likes green.
   - Therefore, the person who likes yellow must live in the second house.

2. **Stew and Grilled Cheese**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the person who had stew lives in the first house, and the romance book lover lives in the second house.

3. **Fantasy Book Enthusiast**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the third house.

4. **Grilled Cheese**: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the second house.
   - Since the person who had stew lives in the first house and the person who likes green lives in the third house, the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the second house.

5. **Romance Book Lover**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This confirms that the romance book lover lives in the second house, which is consistent with the previous information.

From the above deductions:
- **First House**: Person who ate grilled cheese
- **Second House**: Person who had stew, romance book lover
- **Third House**: Person who likes green, fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person who likes green lives in the third house, and the person who likes yellow lives in the second house, the person who likes blue must live in the first house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes blue lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's re-evaluate the situation step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (house 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (house 1), which contradicts the fantasy book enthusiast. Therefore, we must reassess the placement of the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist cannot both be in the first house, we need to place them in different houses. Let's place the fantasy book enthusiast in the first house (house 1) and the cellist in the second house (house 2).

Now, clue 3 states that the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (who likes green) lives in house 1, the person who likes red must live in house 2.

This means:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green.
- The person who likes red (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

The number of the house where the mystery book reader lives is **2**."

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
2. The golfer lives in the second house.
3. The history book buff lives in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the golfer lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

From Clue 3, the history book buff lives in the first house. This confirms our arrangement:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Unknown

Now, using Clue 1: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives. This means the science fiction book fanatic cannot live in the first or third house because there would be no house between them and the swimmer. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Now, the swimmer must live in the first or third house. But since the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house, the swimmer must live in the first house. This gives us:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Golfer
- Third house: Science fiction book fanatic

Thus, the swimmer lives in the first house.

The number of the house where the swimmer lives is **(A) 1**."

From Clue 2, we know:
- The flutist does not live in house 1, so the flutist must live in house 2.

Since the flutist lives in house 2, the person with the bouquet of lilies must also live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is:

(B) 2"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).
4. **Tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the tennis player is in house \(i+1\) or later.
5. **There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet**: This means if the rose bouquet is in house \(i\), the daffodils are in house \(i+1\) or \(i-1\).
6. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\).

### Deductions:
- **House 3**: Rose bouquet.
- **House 2**: Fantasy book enthusiast (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer).
- **House 4**: Tennis player (since the tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader, and house 4 is taken by the carnations arrangement, the tennis player must be in house 5, but house 5 is not available, so the tennis player must be in house 4, which is a contradiction, so the tennis player must be in house 5).
- **House 1**: Mystery book reader (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- **House 5**: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

### Final Placement:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player.
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast.

### Conclusion:
The romance book lover must be in house 2, as there are two houses between the mystery book reader (house 1) and the romance book lover.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions, let's piece together the information:

1. **Coffee drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Coffee drinker.

2. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the computer and gameboy cannot be in House 3. So, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

3. **The saxophonist does not live in the second house.**
   - Possible houses for saxophonist: 1, 3, 4, 5.

4. **The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.**
   - Possible houses for daffodils: 1, 3, 4, 5.

5. **The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.**
   - Possible houses for gameboy: 1, 3, 4, 5.

6. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - If the computer is in House 4, the gameboy must be in House 3 (but the coffee drinker is in House 3). So, the computer must be in House 5 and the gameboy in House 4.

7. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.**
   - Computer in House 5, so cellist must be in House 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the computer is in House 5, the percussionist must be in House 4 (but cellist is in House 4). So, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3 and the percussionist in House 5.

9. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
   - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

10. **The person who likes milk lives in the fifth house.**
    - House 5: Milk drinker.

11. **The person who has a television does not live in the fifth house.**
    - Possible houses for television: 1, 2, 3, 4.

12. **The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

13. **The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

14. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
    - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

15. **The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

16. **The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

### Final Deductions:
- Coffee drinker in House 3.
- Computer in House 5, cellist in House 4, percussionist in House 5.
- Milk drinker in House 5.
- Television in House 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Saxophonist in House 1, 2, 3, 4.

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.**
   - This means if the minivan driver is in house 2, the person wearing boots must be in house 1.
   - If the minivan driver is in house 3, the person wearing boots must be in house 2.

2. **The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**
   - This means if the person with the rose bouquet is in house 1, the person with pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 2, the person with pizza must be in house 3.
   - If the person with the rose bouquet is in house 3, the person with pizza must be in house 3 (but this is not possible since the person with pizza must be to the right).

3. **The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person wearing running shoes must live in either house 2 or 3.

4. **The cricketer lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.**
   - This means if the person with tulips is in house 2, the cricketer must be in house 1.
   - If the person with tulips is in house 3, the cricketer must be in house 2.

5. **The person who had pizza does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with pizza must live in either house 1 or 3.

6. **The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan.**
   - This means if the person with grilled cheese is in house 2, the person with sedan must be in house 1.
   - If the person with grilled cheese is in house 3, the person with sedan must be in house 2.

7. **The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.**
   - This means the person driving a minivan is in house 3.

8. **The golfer lives in the first house.**
   - This means the golfer is in house 1.

9. **The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.**
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet must live in either house 1 or 3.

Now, let's combine all the clues:

- From clue 7, the person driving a minivan is in house 3.
- From clue 8, the golfer is in house 1.
- From clue 5, the person who had pizza cannot be in house 2, so the person who had pizza must be in house 1 or 3. Since the golfer is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.
- From clue 4, the cricketer must be in house 1 (since the person with tulips cannot be in house 1).
- From clue 3, the person wearing running shoes cannot be in house 1, so the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.
- From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in house 2 (since the person with sedan must be in house 1).
- From clue 2, the person with pizza (in house 3) must be to the right of the person with the rose bouquet. Since the person with pizza is in house 3, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 1.
- From clue 1, the person wearing boots must be in house 2 (since the person driving a minivan is in house 3).

Therefore, the person with the rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the third house.

12. **Clue 14:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
13. **Clue 15:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.

Let's start by placing the saxophonist in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Saxophonist

Next, the flutist lives in the second house (Clue 9).

- House 2: Flutist

The cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other (Clue 3).

- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 5: Person who likes milk

The person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live next to each other (Clue 5).

- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice
- House 4: Person who had stew
- House 5: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who likes yellow

There is one house between where the person who likes yellow lives and where the root beer lover lives (Clue 12).

- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice
- House 4: Person who had stew
- House 5: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who likes yellow
- House 5: Person who likes root beer

The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese (Clue 13).

- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice
- House 4: Person who had stew
- House 5: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who likes yellow
- House 5: Person who likes root beer

The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red (Clue 14).

- House 4: Person who had stew
- House 5: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who likes yellow
- House 5: Person who likes root beer

The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker (Clue 15).

- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice
- House 4: Person who had stew
- House 5: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who likes yellow
- House 5: Person who likes root beer

The coffee drinker lives directly left of the percussionist (Clue 10).

- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice
- House 4: Person who had stew
- House 5: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who likes yellow
- House 5: Person who likes root beer
- House 4: Person who drinks coffee
- House 3: Percussionist

Thus, the percussionist lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who ate fried rice lives in house 3.
2. **Clue 8**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.
3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
7. **Clue 4**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
8. **Clue 5**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Let's start by placing the person who ate fried rice in house 3:
- House 3: Fried Rice

Next, consider Clue 8:
- White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.

Now, consider Clue 6:
- Red must be in house \(x-1\) if Stew is in house \(x\).

Since Stew cannot be in house 2 or 4 (Clue 2 and Clue 3), Stew must be in house 1 or 5.

If Stew is in house 1:
- Red must be in house 2.
- White and Yellow must be in houses 2 and 4 (Clue 8).

This configuration does not work because Red and White cannot be in houses 2 and 4 simultaneously.

If Stew is in house 5:
- Red must be in house 4.
- White and Yellow must be in houses 2 and 4 (Clue 8).

This configuration does not work because Red and White cannot be in houses 2 and 4 simultaneously.

If Stew is in house 2:
- Red must be in house 1.
- White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5 (Clue 8).

This configuration does not work because Red and White cannot be in houses 1 and 5 simultaneously.

If Stew is in house 4:
- Red must be in house 3.
- White and Yellow must be in houses 1 and 5 (Clue 8).

This configuration does not work because Red and White cannot be in houses 1 and 5 simultaneously.

Finally, if Stew is in house 1:
- Red must be in house 2.
- White and Yellow must be in houses 2 and 4 (Clue 8).

This configuration works:
- House 1: Green
- House 2: White
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 4: Yellow
- House 5: Red

Thus, the person who likes white lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in house number 2. This leaves us with houses 1 and 3 for the person who likes red and the remaining two people (the violinist and the basketball player).

From Clue 2, the person who likes red lives in house number 3. This means house number 1 is occupied by the violinist or the basketball player.

From Clue 1, the violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the basketball player cannot be in house 3.

From Clue 3, the basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. This means the tennis player cannot be in house 3, and the basketball player cannot be in house 1.

From Clue 4, the person who likes yellow does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the percussionist, the person who likes yellow must live in either house 1 or house 3. Given that the person who likes red lives in house 3, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: Person who likes red
- House 4: Violinist

Therefore, the basketball player must be in house 1.

The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (A) 1."

### Placing the Saxophonist and Science Fiction Book Fanatic

Let's place the saxophonist in house 1 and the science fiction book fanatic in house 2.

### Placing the Person with Carnations and Cellist

Since the person with carnations and the cellist are two houses apart, and the person with carnations cannot be in the fifth house, we can place the person with carnations in house 3 and the cellist in house 5.

### Placing the Person with Daffodils and Cat Lover

The person with daffodils is one house apart from the person with horses, and the person with daffodils is to the left of the cat lover. Let's place the person with daffodils in house 2 and the person with horses in house 3. The cat lover must be in house 4.

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues step by step:

1. **Dog owner lives in the second house.**
   - House 2: Dog owner

2. **Fish enthusiast lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Fish enthusiast

3. **Gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the radio.**
   - This means the gameboy cannot be in House 5, and the radio cannot be in House 1.

4. **Bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the truck.**
   - The truck cannot be in House 1, and the bouquet of daffodils cannot be in House 5.

5. **Convertible lives next to the person with the vase of tulips.**
   - The convertible must be in House 5, so the vase of tulips must be in House 4.

6. **There are two houses between the truck and the convertible.**
   - The truck must be in House 4, and the convertible must be in House 5.

7. **Minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.**
   - The dog owner is in House 2, so the minivan must be in House 3, 4, or 5. Since the truck is in House 4, the minivan must be in House 3 or 5. Given the convertible is in House 5, the minivan must be in House 3.

8. **Computer lives in the second house.**
   - The second house is occupied by the dog owner, so the computer must be in House 2.

9. **Bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.**
   - The bird keeper cannot be in House 5, and the bouquet of lilies cannot be in House 1.

10. **Carnations arrangement and vase of tulips live directly next to each other.**

11. **There is one house between the person with the television and the person with the SUV.**
    - The television must be in House 3, and the SUV must be in House 5.

Given these deductions, the person with the vase of tulips lives in House 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
2. The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
3. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
4. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
5. The basketball player lives in the first house.
6. The saxophonist lives in the first house.
7. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

Given that the basketball player lives in the first house (house 1) and the saxophonist also lives in the first house (house 1), we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: ?
- House 3: ?

From Clue 7, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk. This means the person who had stew and the person who likes milk are not adjacent.

From Clue 4, the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner. This means the pizza eater and the dog owner are adjacent.

From Clue 2, the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer. This means the tea drinker and the cricketer are adjacent.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives. This means the person who only drinks water and the fish enthusiast are not adjacent.

From Clue 1, there is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives. This means the cat lover and the guitarist are not adjacent.

Let's place the remaining people:
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Guitarist (since the cat lover and guitarist are not adjacent and the cat lover cannot be in house 1)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (tea drinker, pizza eater)

Now, the tea drinker must be in house 2 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer) and the cricketer must be in house 3 (since the tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer).

The person who only drinks water must be in house 1 (since the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the fish enthusiast).

The person who had pizza must be in house 2 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).

The dog owner must be in house 3 (since the person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner).

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (B) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **High Heels and Daffodils**: The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. This means if the person with high heels is in house 1, the person with daffodils must be in house 2. Conversely, if the person with high heels is in house 2, the person with daffodils must be in house 1.
2. **History Book Buff**: The history book buff lives in the first house (house 1).
3. **Cat Lover**: The cat lover does not live in the second house (house 2).
4. **Computer and Loafers**: The person with a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing loafers. This means if the person with a computer is in house 2, the person with loafers must be in house 1. Conversely, if the person with a computer is in house 1, the person with loafers must be in house 2.

From clue 2, we know the history book buff lives in house 1. So, the person in house 1 has a history book and the person in house 2 has a romance book.

From clue 3, the cat lover does not live in house 2, so the cat lover must live in house 1. This contradicts the history book buff living in house 1. Therefore, the cat lover must live in house 2.

From clue 4, the person with a computer lives somewhere to the right of the person with loafers. Since the history book buff is in house 1, the person with a computer must be in house 2 (since house 1 is already taken by the history book buff). This means the person with loafers must be in house 1.

Now, we have:
- House 1: History book buff (romance book lover) and person with loafers (loafers)
- House 2: Cat lover (cat enthusiast) and person with computer (computer)

From clue 1, the person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person with a bouquet of daffodils. Since the person with loafers is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1. This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is **1**."

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
2. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

**Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

**Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

**Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
- If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
- If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).
- There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (Clue 4).

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information provided:

1. The person eating kiwis lives in house 1.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in house 1.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:
- Since the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the fantasy book enthusiast cannot be in house 1.
- Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 8**: The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 10**: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
4. **Clue 1**: The bird keeper and the person who has a television live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 3**: The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
6. **Clue 4**: The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
7. **Clue 6**: The person who had pizza does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 7**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house.
9. **Clue 9**: The person who likes red lives in the third house.
10. **Clue 11**: The person who has a computer does not live in the second house.
11. **Clue 12**: There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who has a television lives.

From Clue 7, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who ate grilled cheese.

From Clue 11, there is one house between the person who ate fried rice and the person who has a television.

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the third house.
2. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
3. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
5. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. From Clue 4, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. From Clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or third house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house (since the person who had stew cannot live in the second house).

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who likes white must live in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew.

Now, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. The person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the second house (Clue 3), so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. Since the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or second house. From Clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house number 1 or 3. However, the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), so the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people. From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker (CD) lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals (SW). This means the CD cannot be in house 2, and the SW cannot be in house 1.
2. **Clue 2:** The science fiction book fanatic (SF) lives in house 1.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The SF lives in house 1.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The CD cannot be in house 1, so the CD must be in house 2.
- The SW cannot be in house 1, so the SW must be in house 1.

This leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be assigned to the remaining houses. Since the CD is in house 2 and the SW is in house 1, the water drinker must be in house 1, and the romance book lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information and clues systematically:

1. **Clue 1:** The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This means the percussionist and the person with the radio are neighbors, and the percussionist is to the left of the person with the radio.

Given the house numbers:
- House 1: Person 1
- House 2: Person 2

From Clue 1, the only possible arrangement is:
- The percussionist is in House 1.
- The person with the radio is in House 2.

2. **Clue 2:** Each person plays a different musical instrument: one is a pianist and one is a percussionist.
   - Since the percussionist is in House 1, the pianist must be in House 2.

3. **Clue 3:** Each person has a different device: one has a radio and one has a phone.
   - Since the person with the radio is in House 2, the person with the phone must be in House 1.

Therefore, the person with the phone lives in House 1.

The number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is:
(A) 1"
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.

From clue 1, we know the second house is occupied by the person who drives a convertible.

From clue 2, the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them. This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3.

From clue 3, the person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Given the positions of the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan, the only way this can be satisfied is if the person who owns a sedan is in house 3 and the person who likes yellow is in house 2.

Therefore, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

   - House 5: Truck

   Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover, and the person who is wearing high heels lives two houses to the right of the person who has a bouquet of lilies, we can deduce:
   - House 3: Fish Enthusiast
   - House 4: Sandals
   - House 5: Truck

   - House 2: Loafers

   The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in House 1 or House 2.

2. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

From Clue 3, we know the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Fried Rice
- House 3: ?

From Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house. So, the arrangement is now:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: ?

From Clue 2, the person who ate fried rice (in the second house) lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Since the fried rice person is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in a house to the left of the second house. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: ?

From Clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the fried rice person is in the second house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in House 1:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Spaghetti Eater
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: ?

Now, the only person left to place is the grilled cheese eater. Since the grilled cheese eater cannot be in House 1 (because the science fiction book fanatic is there) and cannot be in House 3 (because the grilled cheese eater cannot be to the right of the fried rice eater), the grilled cheese eater must be in House 3:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Fanatic, Spaghetti Eater
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Enthusiast
- House 3: Grilled Cheese Eater

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

Given Clue 3, the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1). Therefore, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

Thus, the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals.
   - This means the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2 (the right house).

2. **Clue 2:** The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live directly next to each other.
   - Since the person wearing sandals cannot be in house 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (the left house).

3. **Clue 3:** The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
   - Since the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the tea drinker must be in house 1 (because the tea drinker cannot be in house 2).

From these clues, we can deduce:
- The person wearing sandals is in house 1.
- The person eating grapes is in house 1 (since they live next to the person wearing sandals).
- The tea drinker is in house 1.
- The person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (since they live to the right of the person wearing sandals and cannot be in house 1).

This leaves the following characteristics for the person in house 2:
- The person in house 2 must be the one wearing high heels.
- The person in house 2 must have a phone (since the person in house 1 has a television).
- The person in house 2 must be a water drinker (since the person in house 1 is a tea drinker).

4. The violinist does not live in the third house.

Given the tea drinker is in house 1, we can deduce the following:

- House 1: Tea drinker

- House 3: Violinist (since the violinist cannot be in house 3, and there must be one house between the violinist and the guitarist)

Since the cellist is in house 2 and the violinist is in house 3, the guitarist must be in house 1, but that contradicts the tea drinker being in house 1. Therefore, the guitarist must be in house 2.

Thus, the guitarist lives in house 2.

6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the third house is occupied by someone wearing sandals. From Clue 3, the person who only drinks water must be in the fourth house, and the person who is wearing sandals is in the third house.

From Clue 4, the tea drinker lives in the fifth house.

From Clue 2, the person who is wearing running shoes cannot live in the first house.

From Clue 5, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4, or 3 and 5. Since the third house is occupied by someone wearing sandals, the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 2 and 4.

From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water (in the fourth house) must be to the left of the person who is wearing boots (in the first house).

Given these constraints, the only house where the person who only drinks water lives is the fourth house.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who has a computer does not live in the fourth house.
   - The computer cannot be in house 4.

Let's start by placing the pizza in house 4:
- House 4: Pizza

Next, we need to place the computer and radio:
- The computer cannot be in house 4, so it must be in one of houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- The radio cannot be in house 4, so it must be in one of houses 1, 2, 3, or 5.
- The computer and radio must be separated by one house.

Let's try placing the computer in house 1:
- House 1: Computer
- House 4: Pizza

Now, the computer and radio must be separated by one house. The radio cannot be in house 4, so it must be in house 2 or 5.

If the radio is in house 2:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

This configuration is not possible because the radio is already in house 2.

If the radio is in house 5:
- House 1: Computer
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

This configuration is not possible because the radio is already in house 3.

Let's try placing the computer in house 2:
- House 2: Computer
- House 4: Pizza

Now, the computer and radio must be separated by one house. The radio cannot be in house 4, so it must be in house 3.

- House 1: Computer
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

This configuration is not possible because the radio is already in house 3.

Now, the computer and radio must be separated by one house. The radio cannot be in house 4, so it must be in house 2.

- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

This configuration is not possible because the radio is already in house 2.

Let's try placing the computer in house 5:
- House 5: Computer
- House 4: Pizza

Now, the computer and radio must be separated by one house. The radio cannot be in house 4, so it must be in house 4.

- House 1: Computer
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

This configuration is not possible because the radio is already in house 3.

Finally, let's try placing the computer in house 2:
- House 2: Computer
- House 4: Pizza

Now, the computer and radio must be separated by one house. The radio cannot be in house 4, so it must be in house 3.

- House 1: Computer
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

This configuration is not possible because the radio is already in house 3.

After all these trials, the only consistent configuration is:
- House 1: Computer
- House 3: Radio
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Television

Given the clues, the person who ate spaghetti must be directly left of the person who has a radio. Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2.

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."

15. **Tennis Player in First House**: The tennis player lives in the first house.
16. **Percussionist in Fourth House**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
17. **Pianist Not in Third House**: The pianist does not live in the third house.
18. **Apples and Golfer**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
19. **Pizza and Fifth House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 15, the tennis player lives in the first house. From clue 16, the percussionist lives in the fourth house. From clue 17, the pianist does not live in the third house. From clue 18, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. From clue 19, the person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

Let's deduce the pianist's position:
- The pianist cannot be in the third house (clue 17).
- The pianist cannot be in the first house (clue 15).
- The pianist cannot be in the fourth house (clue 16).
- The pianist cannot be in the fifth house (clue 19).

Thus, the pianist must live in the second house. From clue 7, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the pianist lives in the second house, the person who owns horses must live in the third house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must live in the first house.

From clue 1, the pianist (second house) lives directly left of the person who owns horses (third house). This is consistent.

From clue 14, the saxophonist and the golfer live one house apart. Since the pianist is in the second house, the saxophonist and the golfer must be in the first and third houses, respectively. This is consistent with the pianist being in the second house.

From clue 10, the saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other. Since the pianist is in the second house, the saxophonist must be in the first house, and the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the third house. This is consistent.

From clue 11, the tennis player and the baseball player live directly next to each other. Since the tennis player is in the first house, the baseball player must be in the second house. This is consistent with the pianist being in the second house.

From clue 12, the basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover. Since the pianist is in the second house, the basketball player must be in the first house, and the cat lover must be in the third house. This is consistent with the pianist being in the second house.

From clue 13, the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses. Since the person who owns horses is in the third house, the person who is eating mangos must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the percussionist is in the fourth house, the person who is eating mangos must be in the fifth house.

From clue 4, the person who is eating apples does not live in the second house. Since the pianist is in the second house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first, third, or fifth house. Since the person who owns horses is in the third house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first or fifth house. Since the person who is eating mangos is in the fifth house, the person who is eating apples must be in the first house.

From clue 5, the person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating oranges is in the fifth house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the fourth house. This is consistent with the percussionist being in the fourth house.

From clue 6, the dog owner does not live in the first house. Since the person who is eating apples is in the first house, the dog owner must live in the second house. This is consistent with the bird keeper being in the second house.

From clue 8, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese. Since the person who owns horses is in the third house and the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house, this is consistent.

From clue 9, the person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person who is eating a banana is in the fifth house, the person who had stew must be in the fourth house. This is consistent with the percussionist being in the fourth house.

From clue 18, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who is eating mangos is in the fifth house and the person who is eating apples is in the first house, this is consistent.

From clue 19, the person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house. Since the person who is eating mangos is in the fifth house, the person who had pizza must be in the first, third, or fourth house. Since the person who is eating apples is in the first house, the person who had pizza must be in the third or fourth house. Since the person who is eating oranges is in the fourth house, the person who had pizza must be in the third house.

Thus, the person who is eating a banana lives in the fifth house.

The answer is (A) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of the individuals:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 2, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2 or 3. Since the bird keeper must be to the left of the grilled cheese eater, the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 1.

This leaves the guitarist and the pizza eater to be placed in houses 1 and 2. Since the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2 (because the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the pizza eater cannot be in house 2).

Thus, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The bird keeper lives in the third house.
2. The cat lover does not live in the second house.
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
4. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
5. The baseball player does not live in the third house.
6. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
7. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.
8. The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
9. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

From Clue 2, we know the bird keeper lives in house 3.

From Clue 4, the person who drives a convertible cannot live in house 1. From Clue 5, the baseball player cannot live in house 3. From Clue 6, the person who drives a convertible also cannot live in house 3.

From Clue 8, the soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper, which means the soccer player must live in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player, so the fish enthusiast must live in house 1 or 2 as well.

Since the bird keeper is in house 3, the convertible driver cannot be in house 3. The convertible driver cannot be in house 1 (Clue 4). Therefore, the convertible driver must be in house 2.

Now, the baseball player cannot be in house 3 (Clue 5) and cannot be in house 2 (since the convertible driver is there). Thus, the baseball player must be in house 1.

The sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player, so the sedan owner must be in house 4.

This leaves house 1 for the fish enthusiast, house 2 for the convertible driver, house 3 for the bird keeper, and house 4 for the sedan owner.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: ?
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

2. **Clue 5**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating a banana lives. This means the person who likes white and the person who is eating a banana must be in houses 1 and 3, or houses 2 and 4. Since the person who is eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who is eating a banana must be in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: ?

3. **Clue 4**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes green must be in a house to the left of the person who likes yellow. Given the arrangement so far, the person who likes green must be in house 1 or house 2. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who likes white, the person who likes green must be in house 2. This contradicts Clue 6, which states that the person who is eating grapes is in house 2. Therefore, the person who likes green must be in house 1, and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: ?
   - House 4: Yellow

4. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes red lives. This means the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who likes red lives in house 3. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

5. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green and the person who likes red live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes green is in house 1 and the person who likes red is in house 3, this clue is satisfied. So, the arrangement so far is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Yellow

6. **Clue 1**: The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis. Since the person who likes red is in house 3 and the person who is eating kiwis must be in a house to the right of house 3, the person who is eating kiwis must be in house 4. So, the arrangement is:
   - House 1: Green
   - House 2: Grapes
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: Kiwis

Therefore, the person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. The correct answer is (A) 4."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.
   - This means the person eating oranges must be in house 1, and the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the cat lover.

3. **Clue 3:** The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.
   - This means the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be in adjacent houses, with the mystery book reader in the house to the left of the person who had stew.

Given these clues, let's deduce the arrangement:

- Since the person eating oranges is in house 1, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.
- The person who had stew must be in house 1 (since they are next to the mystery book reader, and the mystery book reader is next to the cat lover).
- The person who ate fried rice must be in house 3 (since it's the only remaining house).

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who had stew is in house 1.
- The person wearing running shoes is in house 2.
- The mystery book reader and the cat lover must be in adjacent houses, and the mystery book reader must be in house 1 (since the person who had stew is in house 1 and they must be next to each other).

Thus, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
3. The root beer lover lives in the first house.
4. The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
5. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in house 1. From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2. From Clue 4, the person who has a television cannot live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. From Clue 5, if the person with the television lives in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 (which contradicts Clue 2). Therefore, the person with the television must live in house 3, and the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2.

This leaves house 1 for the person who likes root beer. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils must live in house 1 (since the root beer lover lives in house 1 and the daffodils must be directly left of the phone, which is in house 2).

Thus, the person who likes root beer lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues and deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Wearing loafers

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - Phone: House 1, 2
   - Mangos: House 2, 3

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - Grapes: House 1, 2
   - Water: House 2, 3

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - Boots: House 1, 2

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
   - Kiwis: House 1, 2
   - Milk: House 2, 3

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Boots: House 1, 2
   - Gameboy: House 1, 2, 3

7. **Clue 7:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the first house.
   - Kiwis: House 2, 3

### Deductions

- **House 1:** Wearing loafers (Clue 1)
- **House 2:** Phone, Boots, Gameboy (Clue 2, Clue 6)
- **House 3:** Mangos, Milk, Kiwis (Clue 2, Clue 5)

Since the person with the phone is in House 2, the person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy. The person with the phone is not the one who has a gameboy, so the person with the phone is the one who has a computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

The answer is (A) 2."

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person eating oranges lives in the first house (House 1).
2. The person driving a truck lives directly left of the person driving a convertible.
3. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
4. The person eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person owning horses lives in the third house (House 3).
6. The person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible live directly next to each other.

From Clue 5, we know:
- House 3: Owning horses.

From Clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Eating oranges.

From Clue 4, we know:
- House 3: Not eating mangos.

From Clue 6, we know:
- The person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible must be in adjacent houses.

Since the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), and the person driving a convertible must be adjacent to the person eating mangos (Clue 6), the only possible positions for the person eating mangos and the person driving a convertible are:
- House 1: Eating oranges (Clue 1)
- House 2: Driving a convertible (Clue 6)
- House 3: Owning horses (Clue 5)

Now, we need to place the bird keeper and the dog owner. From Clue 3, the bird keeper must be to the right of the dog owner. The only remaining houses are 2 and 3, but house 3 is occupied by the person owning horses. Therefore, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 1. Given that house 1 is occupied by the person eating oranges, the bird keeper and the dog owner must be in houses 2 and 3.

Thus, the only remaining house for the person driving a truck is house 2.

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who had stew.
2. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
3. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
4. There are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives.

6. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
7. The guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
9. There is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives.
10. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house.

Let's deduce step by step:

- From Clue 1 and Clue 2, the percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader and directly left of the person who had stew. This means the mystery book reader and the percussionist must be in adjacent houses, and the percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader.
- From Clue 3, the science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
- From Clue 4, there are two houses between where the person who had pizza lives and where the saxophonist lives.
- From Clue 5, the mystery book reader lives directly left of the romance book lover.
- From Clue 6, the fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
- From Clue 7, the guitarist lives directly left of the percussionist.
- From Clue 8, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
- From Clue 9, there is one house between where the mystery book reader lives and where the history book buff lives.
- From Clue 10, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the third house.

Let's place the mystery book reader and saxophonist:
- The saxophonist cannot be in the first or last house, so he must be in the second or fourth house.
- The mystery book reader must be directly left of the saxophonist, so the saxophonist must be in the second house and the mystery book reader must be in the first house.

Now, let's place the percussionist:
- The percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the percussionist must be in the third or fourth house.
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The guitarist must be to the left of the percussionist, so the guitarist must be in the first or second house.

Given the saxophonist is in the second house, the mystery book reader is in the first house, and the guitarist is to the left of the percussionist, the only possible positions for the percussionist are the third or fourth house. Let's check the third house:
- If the percussionist is in the third house, the guitarist must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the percussionist must be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the science fiction book fanatic:
- The science fiction book fanatic must be to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first or second house.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the first house because the mystery book reader is there.
- Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.

Thus, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house, and the guitarist must be in the second house.

Now, let's place the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist:
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first or second house, but the first house is occupied by the science fiction book fanatic.
- Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, and the flutist must be in the third house.

Now, let's place the history book buff:
- The history book buff must be in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff must be in the second house, but this is already occupied by the saxophonist.
- Therefore, the history book buff must be in the third house, and the flutist must be in the fourth house.

Finally, let's place the person who ate spaghetti:
- The person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.
- The person who ate spaghetti must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth or fifth house.
- The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the percussionist lives in the fourth house.

11. **Clue 1**: The percussionist and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
    - This means the percussionist and guitarist must be in adjacent houses.

12. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives in house 3.
    - House 3: Green

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

- House 3: Green
- House 3: Radio
- House 3: Computer (since the computer must be to the left of the phone, and the computer cannot be in house 2)
- House 3: Phone (since the computer is in house 3, the phone must be in house 4)
- House 3: Gameboy (since the phone is in house 4, the gameboy must be in house 3)
- House 3: Television (since the television lives directly left of the person who likes red, and the television is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2)
- House 2: Red
- House 2: Percussionist (since the percussionist lives directly left of the person who likes white, and the percussionist is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 3)
- House 3: White
- House 3: Saxophonist (since the saxophonist must be in the remaining house, which is house 1)
- House 1: Saxophonist
- House 1: Guitarist (since the guitarist lives directly next to the percussionist, and the percussionist is in house 2, the guitarist must be in house 1)
- House 1: Green (already confirmed)
- House 1: Cellist (since the cellist does not live in house 5, and the cellist cannot be in house 1, the cellist must be in house 4)
- House 4: Cellist
- House 4: Television (since the television lives directly left of the person who likes red, and the television is in house 3, the person who likes red must be in house 2)
- House 2: Red
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 2: White (already confirmed)
- House 2: Guitarist (already confirmed)
- House 2: Cellist (already confirmed)
- House 2: Television (already confirmed)
- House 5: Violinist (since the violinist lives two houses away from the percussionist, and the percussionist is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 5)
- House 5: Violinist

Thus, the saxophonist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (D) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist (in house 1) and the mystery book reader (in house 2) must be in that order.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - This means the history book buff (in house 1) and the cat lover (in house 2) must be in that order.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - Since the cellist (in house 1) and the mystery book reader (in house 2) are already fixed, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2.

Given Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce:
- The cellist (in house 1) and the mystery book reader (in house 2) are in the correct order.
- The history book buff (in house 1) and the cat lover (in house 2) are in the correct order.

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be next to each other and the cellist and mystery book reader are already in houses 1 and 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

Let's break it down step by step:

- From Clue 1, if the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this scenario is not possible.
- From Clue 2, the dog owner cannot be in house 2.
- From Clue 3, the person with the vase of tulips must be in a house to the right of the dog owner.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the dog owner is in house 1 (since they cannot be in house 2), the bird keeper must be in house 2 (since they cannot be in house 1), and the carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (Clue 1). This leaves the vase of tulips to be in house 3, which contradicts the condition that the vase of tulips must be to the right of the dog owner. Therefore, the dog owner cannot be in house 1.
- If the dog owner is in house 3, the bird keeper must be in house 1 (since they cannot be in house 2), and the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1). This leaves the vase of tulips to be in house 3, which satisfies the condition that the vase of tulips is to the right of the dog owner.

Thus, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Swimmer

2. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not apples

3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
   - Possible positions for boots and kiwis: (1, 3) or (2, 4)

   - House 2: Not loafers

5. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - Possible positions for tulips and cricketer: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4)

10. **Clue 11**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
    - Possible positions for rose bouquet and banana: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4)

12. **Clue 12**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
    - Possible positions for gameboy and basketball: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4)

Let's combine these clues:

- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Sandals, Computer
- **House 3**: Not apples, Not loafers, Not lilies, Not gameboy, Not basketball, Not rose bouquet, Not banana
- **House 4**: Swimmer

Since House 3 cannot be apples, loafers, lilies, gameboy, or banana, and it must be something else, let's try the remaining options:

- **House 3**: Banana (since it's the only option left that fits the conditions)

Now, let's place the remaining items:

- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Sandals, Computer
- **House 3**: Banana
- **House 4**: Swimmer

Now, we need to place the remaining items (gameboy, basketball, rose bouquet, loafers, and lilies):

- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Sandals, Computer
- **House 3**: Banana
- **House 4**: Swimmer

Since House 3 is occupied by Banana, the remaining items must fit the conditions:

- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Sandals, Computer
- **House 3**: Banana
- **House 4**: Swimmer

The only remaining item for House 1 is the gameboy, and for House 2 is the basketball. The remaining items (loafers and lilies) must fit the conditions:

- **House 1**: Gameboy
- **House 2**: Basketball
- **House 3**: Banana
- **House 4**: Swimmer

The remaining items (loafers and lilies) must fit the conditions:

- **House 1**: Gameboy
- **House 2**: Basketball
- **House 3**: Banana
- **House 4**: Swimmer

The only remaining item for House 1 is the loafers, and for House 4 is the lilies.

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in **House 1**.

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue:

1. The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Eating mangos.

2. The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Not horses.

3. The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2, and vice versa.

4. The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not banana.

5. The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not horses.

6. The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means if the person eating a banana is in house 1, the dog owner must be in house 2, and vice versa.

From Clue 6, the person eating a banana must be in house 1, and the dog owner must be in house 2. This leaves house 3 and house 4 for the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis.

Since the person eating mangos is in house 1, the bird keeper and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Given that the person eating a banana is in house 1, the person eating kiwis must be in house 3 (since they must be adjacent to the bird keeper).

Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 4.

The bird keeper lives in house 4. The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4:** The mystery book reader lives in the first house (House 1).
   - House 1: Mystery book reader

2. **Clue 3:** The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means the history book buff and the bird keeper must be in adjacent houses, and since the mystery book reader is in House 1, the only possible adjacent houses are House 2 and House 3.

3. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.
   - Therefore, the bird keeper must live in House 3 (since the romance book lover cannot live in House 3, and the bird keeper must be in an adjacent house).

4. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
   - Since the bird keeper lives in House 3, the romance book lover must live in House 2.

Thus, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Bird keeper

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(B) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the arrangement of the people in the houses:

1. **Clue 1:** The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
   - This directly places the coffee drinker in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - This means the apple eater and the water drinker must be adjacent, with the apple eater to the left of the water drinker.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the first house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 2, 3, or 4.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - This means the mangos eater lives in houses 1 or 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
   - This means the apple eater must be in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who is eating kiwis does not live in the third house.
   - This means the kiwi eater lives in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- If the mangos eater is in house 1, then the kiwi eater must be in house 4 (since they cannot be in house 3).
- The apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Mangos eater
  - House 2: Coffee drinker (Clue 1)
  - House 3: Apple eater
  - House 4: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The mangos eater is in house 1.
- The kiwi eater is in house 4.
- The water drinker is in house 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."

From Clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer cannot live in house 5, and the golfer must be to the left of the cricketer, the golfer must live in house 1, and the cricketer must live in house 4.

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives. Since the person who likes white lives in house 2 (where the person who is eating kiwis lives), the person who likes blue must live in house 4 (where the cricketer lives).

From Clue 1, the person who likes white (house 2) lives directly left of the person who likes red (house 4). Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who likes red must live in house 1.

From Clue 3, the person who likes white (house 2) lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player (house 4). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From Clue 4, there is one house between where the person who likes white (house 2) lives and where the person who is eating apples (house 4). This is consistent with the arrangement.

"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the SUV lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the root beer lover).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan driver cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the minivan driver).

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.
- The truck driver is to the right of the root beer lover.
- The minivan driver is not in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the clues:

1. **Blue and Spaghetti**: The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
2. **Stew and Lilies**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. **Rose and Truck**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
4. **Minivan and Stew**: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
5. **Red and First House**: The person who likes red does not live in the first house.
6. **Minivan and Daffodils**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 4, we know the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the minivan person must be in house 2, and the person who had stew must be in house 1.

From Clue 6, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Therefore, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3.

From Clue 3, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in house 2, the person who drives a truck must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in house 2, the person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who likes red does not live in the first house. Since the person who likes red must be in house 3, and the person who likes red does not live in the first house, this is consistent.

Thus, the person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"To determine the house where the person who owns a sedan lives, let's systematically analyze the given clues:

1. **Clue 6:** The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 9:** The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 15:** The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 14:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
6. **Clue 13:** The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 12:** The person who likes green does not live in the third house.
8. **Clue 10:** The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other.
9. **Clue 7:** The flutist lives in the third house.
10. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, the soccer player lives in the second house. From Clue 8, the basketball player lives in the fourth house. From Clue 9, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. From Clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house, so the sedan owner must live in either the first or third house.

From Clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. From Clue 12, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. From Clue 14, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. From Clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other. From Clue 7, the flutist lives in the third house. Therefore, the cellist must live in the second house (since the flutist lives in the third house and they must be next to each other).

Now, let's summarize the known information:
- Second house: Flutist
- Third house: Cellist
- Fourth house: Person who owns an SUV (and also the person who likes white)

Since the sedan owner cannot be in the second house (Clue 15) and the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the sedan owner must be in the first house.

Thus, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze each clue step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in House 3 (since there is no house to the left of House 3), and the person who likes white must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 2 is already taken by the person who likes red, the person who likes white must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 2: Red
   - House 1: White

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

7. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - This is already confirmed as House 3.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This is already confirmed as House 1.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.
- The person who has a television must be in House 4.
- The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

Thus, the person who has a phone must be in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a phone lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's systematically deduce the placement of each person:

1. **Clue 1:** The bird keeper lives in the second house.
   - This directly tells us the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the violinist cannot be in house 1, and the bouquet of lilies cannot be in house 4.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 4, and the person who had pizza cannot be in house 1.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
   - This means the violinist and the person with the rose bouquet must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - This means the dog owner must be in house 3 if the tulips are in house 2, or in house 4 if the tulips are in house 3.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
   - This means the saxophonist cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti cannot be in house 4.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.
   - This means the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in house 4.

8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the bird keeper (house 2) must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (house 4).

9. **Clue 9:** The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
   - This means the person who owns horses lives in house number 4.

10. **Clue 10:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
    - This means the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1.

From Clue 1, we know the bird keeper lives in house 2. From Clue 8, the bird keeper (house 2) must be to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (house 4). Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4, and the bird keeper must be in house 2.

From Clue 9, the person who owns horses lives in house 4, which is consistent with the person who ate spaghetti being in house 4.

From Clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 1, which is consistent with the bird keeper being in house 2.

From Clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese (house 1) must be to the left of the guitarist (house 1), which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the placement.

Given the constraints, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who owns horses

Thus, the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (C) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues:

1. The tea drinker and the person eating grapes live next to each other.
2. The saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other.
3. The baseball player and the person eating grapes live next to each other.
4. The saxophonist lives in the first house.
5. The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other.

Given that the saxophonist lives in house 1, we can deduce the following:

- Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The baseball player and the person eating grapes must be in houses 1 and 2 (Clue 3).
- The romance book lover and the golfer must be in houses 1 and 2 (Clue 5).

Since the golfer is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the baseball player and the tea drinker.

Now, considering the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2 (Clue 1), and the romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2 (Clue 5), we can assign the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Baseball player, Tea drinker
- House 2: Person eating grapes, Golfer

Since the romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2, and the golfer is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 1.

Thus, the person eating mangos must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions, the correct house number where the romance book lover lives is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them:

1. **Clue 3**: The person wearing boots lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 4**: The person with the bouquet of daffodils lives in the first house.
3. **Clue 1**: The person with the bouquet of lilies does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 2**: The person wearing high heels does not live in the second house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The first house is occupied by the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person wearing boots.

This leaves the second house to be occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies and the person wearing high heels. The third house must then be occupied by the person with the remaining flowers (roses) and the person wearing the remaining shoes (running shoes).

Therefore, the person wearing boots lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

- House 10: Root beer lover (Clue 11, cannot be in house 10)

- House 4: Coffee drinker
- House 6: Root beer lover

Now, let's place the person who likes yellow and the person who likes red (Clue 9).

- Since they live directly next to each other, they must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6.
- Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the yellow and red lovers must be in houses 4 and 5 or 5 and 6.

Let's place the yellow lover in house 5 and the red lover in house 4 (Clue 9).

- House 4: Grilled cheese eater
- House 6: Root beer lover
- House 7: Root beer lover
- House 8: Root beer lover

- House 10: Root beer lover

Next, let's place the person who likes white and the person who likes green (Clue 10).

- The person who likes white lives one house to the left of the person who likes green.
- The person who likes yellow and the person who likes red live directly next to each other (Clue 9).

Let's place the person who likes white in house 2 (Clue 10).

- House 1: Tea drinker

- House 4: Grilled cheese eater

- House 10: Root beer lover

Thus, the person who likes green lives in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the house where the person who ate fried rice lives:

1. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the first house.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips cannot live in the second house (Clue 14).
4. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house (Clue 14).
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan (Clue 10).
6. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck (Clue 3).

From Clue 11, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house. From Clue 14, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. From Clue 10, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.

Let's place the person who has a vase of tulips in the first house. The person who ate spaghetti also lives in the first house. The person who has a rose bouquet must live somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan, and the person who has a rose bouquet cannot live in the second house. Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third or fourth house.

Since the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan, and the person who has a rose bouquet cannot live in the second house, the person who owns a sedan must live in the first house, and the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third or fourth house.

The person who has a rose bouquet cannot live in the second house (Clue 14), so the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third or fourth house. Since the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan, and the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house, the person who has a rose bouquet must live in the third or fourth house.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player (Clue 7). The person who has a bouquet of lilies cannot live in the second house (Clue 14). The person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the third or fourth house.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player (Clue 7). The person who has a bouquet of lilies cannot live in the second house (Clue 14). The person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the third or fourth house.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player (Clue 7). The person who has a bouquet of lilies cannot live in the second house (Clue 14). The person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the third or fourth house.

The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the soccer player (Clue 7). The person who has a bouquet of lilies cannot live in the second house (Clue 14). The person who has a bouquet of lilies must live in the third or fourth house.

From Clue 11, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the fourth house. From Clue 14, the person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. From Clue 10, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.

The only house left for the person who ate fried rice is the second house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"To solve this puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given clues and deduce the characteristics of each person living in the two houses.

1. **Clue 1:** The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

Let's denote the houses as follows:
- House 1: Person 1
- House 2: Person 2

### Step-by-Step Deduction

**From Clue 3:**
- If Person 1 likes yellow, then Person 2 drives a truck.
- If Person 2 likes yellow, then Person 1 drives a truck.

**From Clue 1:**
- If Person 1 drives a truck, then Person 2 eats grapes.
- If Person 2 drives a truck, then Person 1 eats grapes.

**From Clue 2:**
- If Person 1 wears boots, then Person 2 is the mystery book reader.
- If Person 2 wears boots, then Person 1 is the mystery book reader.

### Combining Clues

- If Person 1 likes yellow, then Person 2 drives a truck.
  - If Person 2 drives a truck, then Person 1 eats grapes (Clue 1).
  - If Person 1 eats grapes, then Person 2 wears boots (Clue 2).
  - If Person 2 wears boots, then Person 1 is the mystery book reader (Clue 2).
  - This creates a contradiction because Person 1 cannot like yellow and be the mystery book reader simultaneously.

- Therefore, Person 2 must like yellow.
  - If Person 2 likes yellow, then Person 1 drives a truck.
  - If Person 1 drives a truck, then Person 2 eats grapes (Clue 1).
  - If Person 2 eats grapes, then Person 1 wears boots (Clue 2).
  - If Person 1 wears boots, then Person 2 is the mystery book reader (Clue 2).

### Final Characteristics

- Person 1 (House 1): Likes red, drives a truck, wears boots, and is the mystery book reader.
- Person 2 (House 2): Likes yellow, eats grapes, is the mystery book reader, and wears boots.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast is the only remaining characteristic, and Person 2 is the mystery book reader, Person 1 must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

### Conclusion

The fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 1**.

Thus, the correct answer is (B) 1."

   - House 1: Soccer player
   - House 2: White
   - House 3: Pizza
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 2:** The basketball player lives in the second house.
   - This means House 2 is occupied by the basketball player.

2. **Clue 3:** The violinist lives in the second house.
   - This is a contradiction with Clue 2, but since Clue 3 must be true, it implies that the violinist is in House 2, which is already occupied by the basketball player. This suggests a re-evaluation of the clues or a potential misinterpretation. However, since Clue 3 is given as a fact, we must consider it as is.

3. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
   - This means the cricketer cannot be in House 3, and the cellist cannot be in House 1.

- House 2 is occupied by the basketball player.
- House 1 must be occupied by the cricketer (since the cricketer cannot be in House 3 and the cellist cannot be in House 1).
- House 3 must be occupied by the cellist.

This leaves House 1 for the cricketer and House 3 for the cellist, with House 2 already occupied by the basketball player. Therefore, the soccer player must live in House 1.

The number of the house where the soccer player lives is **(A) 1**."

From Clue 2, we know the mystery book reader (MR) lives in the first house. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3, and the people as Mystery Reader (MR), History Book Buff (HBB), and Science Fiction Fanatic (SFF).

From Clue 1, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the history book buff (HBB). Since MR is in the first house, HBB must be in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since MR is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the history book buff (HBB), which contradicts Clue 1. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the positions.

Since the mystery book reader (MR) is in the first house, the history book buff (HBB) must be in the third house. This means the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: ?
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 4, the mystery book reader (MR) lives directly left of the person who has a television (TV). Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. This means the person with the television is the person who has a computer (C). So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: MR
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB

From Clue 3, the person who has a computer (C) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone (P). Since the person with the computer is in the second house, the person with the phone must be in the first house. This means the person with the phone is the mystery book reader (MR). This is consistent with Clue 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: MR (mystery book reader)
- House 2: TV (computer)
- House 3: HBB (history book buff)

The person who has a phone is the mystery book reader (MR), and the person who has a computer is in the second house. The only person left is the science fiction book fanatic (SFF), who must be in the third house.

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the third house.

Euphoria is indeed commonly associated with drug addiction. The intense feelings of pleasure and well-being that some drugs can induce are often sought after and can lead to repeated use, even in the face of negative consequences. This phenomenon is a key component in the development and maintenance of addiction. However, it's crucial to understand that euphoria is not unique to drug use and can be experienced through various means, including non-drug recreational activities."
"Given the context of fictional characters, it is challenging to definitively state whether Apollo, a god with supernatural abilities, could defeat D'Artagnan, a trained musketeer. However, based on the typical attributes of these characters:

- **Apollo** is often depicted as a powerful and wise figure, but his abilities are not necessarily tied to physical combat.
- **D'Artagnan** is known for his bravery, loyalty, and physical prowess, having been trained in swordsmanship.

Considering these points, it is reasonable to assume that D'Artagnan would be a formidable opponent. Therefore, the most plausible answer is:

(A) No"
"(A) No

Sunscreen is generally not helpful in treating or preventing the condition that killed Bob Marley, which was skin cancer, specifically melanoma. While sunscreen can help protect against sunburn and reduce the risk of skin cancer, it does not treat existing skin cancer. Bob Marley died from advanced melanoma, which had spread to his lungs and brain, and was not caused by sun exposure. Therefore, while using sunscreen is a good preventive measure, it is not a treatment for skin cancer."
"The French Defense, as a standard opening, does not inherently include the four-move checkmate sequence.

Avoiding internet trolls on Reddit is challenging due to their nature as part of the community. However, there are several strategies you can employ to minimize their impact:

1. **Ignore and Report**: Trolls often seek attention, so ignoring their posts and reporting them can help reduce their visibility.
2. **Use Filters and Subreddit Settings**: Some subreddits have filters or settings that can help reduce the number of troll posts you see.
3. **Stay Alert and Vigilant**: Be aware of the signs of troll behavior and be prepared to take action if necessary.
4. **Engage with Respect**: Sometimes, engaging with trolls in a respectful manner can help defuse the situation, but this is not always effective and can sometimes escalate the situation.
5. **Use Moderators**: If a troll is causing significant disruption, flagging the post or the user to the subreddit's moderators can help.

While these strategies can help, it's important to recognize that trolls are a part of the Reddit community and may always be present to some degree."

Mental disorders can manifest in various ways, and while some individuals might attempt to hide their symptoms, the reality is that many signs are often observable by others. Symptoms such as persistent mood swings, significant changes in sleep patterns, withdrawal from social activities, or a decline in academic or work performance can be indicators of a mental health issue. Furthermore, healthcare professionals use a combination of clinical interviews, psychological assessments, and sometimes medical evaluations to diagnose mental disorders. Therefore, it's not feasible to completely hide a mental disorder from others."

"Given the attributes of Iris and Hermes, we can analyze their suitability for a UPS job. Iris, as the goddess of the rainbow and messenger of the gods, is known for her swift and direct communication, as well as her ability to move at great speeds. Hermes, the god of trade, commerce, and thievery, is also a messenger of the gods and is associated with cunning, resourcefulness, and speed.

In the context of a UPS job, which involves handling packages, ensuring timely delivery, and managing inventory, Iris would likely excel due to her speed and communication skills. However, Hermes, while resourceful and quick, might struggle with the more routine and detail-oriented tasks such as inventory management and customer service, which are crucial in a UPS job.

Therefore, while Iris and Hermes would complement each other in terms of speed and communication, Hermes might find the more mundane and repetitive aspects of a UPS job challenging.

Lactic acid is a normal metabolic byproduct that occurs during intense physical activity when the body's demand for energy exceeds the oxygen supply to the muscles. This leads to a buildup of lactic acid, which can cause muscle fatigue and soreness. However, the body has mechanisms to manage and eliminate lactic acid, and it is not inherently harmful in moderate amounts. In fact, lactic acid plays a crucial role in energy production and muscle function. While excessive accumulation can lead to discomfort and fatigue, it is not typically considered bad for the body in general."
"The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was aimed at assassinating King James I and the English nobility, but it did not directly eliminate Mary, Queen of Scots' bloodline.

"To compare the pain and severity of a bull shark bite versus a crocodile bite, we need to consider several factors including the size and strength of the animals, the nature of their bites, and the potential for infection and tissue damage.

Bull sharks are known for their aggressive behavior and are capable of delivering powerful bites. Their bites can be quite severe due to their powerful jaws and the fact that they are found in various coastal and river environments. The pain from a bull shark bite can be intense and may result in significant tissue damage, infection, and other complications.

Crocodiles, while also capable of delivering powerful bites, are generally more selective about their prey and are less likely to attack humans unless provoked or threatened. The severity of the bite can vary depending on the species and the size of the crocodile. However, crocodile bites can still be quite painful and can cause significant tissue damage.

Given these factors, it is difficult to definitively say that one bite is worse than the other. Both can be serious and painful. The severity of the injury would depend on various factors such as the size of the animal, the force of the bite, and the individual's response to the injury.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No"
"(A) No

In the context of ethical decision-making, consent is a crucial element that must be voluntary, informed, and given freely. In the story of Snow White, the characters do not give Snow White her consent to leave the castle. Instead, her parents and stepmother force her to go live with the dwarfs, which does not align with the principles of good consent. Consent is a fundamental ethical concept that involves mutual agreement and understanding, neither of which is present in this narrative scenario."
"(A) No

Avengers Comics would not be out of place in a DC Comics store. Given the extensive crossover events and shared universe stories in the comic book industry, it's quite common for characters from one company to appear in the other's publications. The Avengers, being a significant team in Marvel Comics, have had numerous interactions with DC's characters, making them a natural fit in a DC Comics store."
"(B) No

Rhinoceroses have not been targeted for their horns to improve human sexual experiences.

A cattle farmer could indeed be useful to a drum maker in several indirect ways:

1. **Raw Materials**: Cattle farmers can provide leather, which is a key component in drum making. Leather from cattle is commonly used for drum heads, drum skins, and other parts of the drum.

2. **Networking**: The cattle farmer might have a network of suppliers or contacts that could be beneficial for sourcing materials or finding other resources needed for drum making.

3. **Labor**: If the cattle farmer has a team of workers, they could potentially help with tasks related to the production of drums, such as preparing the leather, cutting, and assembling the drum components.

Thus, the cattle farmer's expertise and resources could support the drum maker's business indirectly."

To spot a full circle of a rainbow, you need to be in a position where sunlight is refracting through raindrops, forming a semi-circular arc in the sky. This typically occurs when you are positioned on one side of a rain shower, looking towards the opposite direction of the sun. Beaches, especially those with a direct line of sight to the horizon, do not provide the necessary conditions for observing a full circle rainbow. The limited angle and the presence of the beach itself can obstruct the formation of a complete arc."

Guitarists often develop calluses on their fingertips due to the repetitive pressure from playing the guitar. These calluses can provide a protective layer, reducing the sensation of pain from the strings. However, the ability to handle pain is a multifaceted physiological response that is not solely determined by the presence of calluses. Calluses do not enhance the pain threshold; they merely reduce the sensation of pain by creating a protective barrier. Therefore, guitarist's fingers do not inherently have a better pain tolerance than the average person."

"To determine if a 500GB USB device is enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day, we need to consider the storage requirements for a single hour of Netflix content. On average, a single hour of high-quality 1080p video from Netflix can range from 1.5GB to 3GB. For a more conservative estimate, let's use 2.5GB per hour.

1. **Storage Requirement for 10 Hours**: 
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times 2.5 \text{ GB/hour} = 25 \text{ GB}
   \]

2. **Comparison with USB Capacity**: 
   A 500GB USB device has a storage capacity of 500GB.

Since 25GB is significantly less than the 500GB capacity of the USB device, a 500GB USB device is more than enough to save 10 hours of Netflix shows a day.

"To determine if Jon Brower Minnoch could have broken a chair before the Voyager 2 launch mass, we need to compare the mass of a typical chair with the mass of the Voyager 2 spacecraft.

A typical chair can weigh anywhere from a few kilograms to a few dozen kilograms, depending on its size and materials. For the sake of this comparison, let's consider a chair that weighs around 10 kilograms.

The launch mass of Voyager 2 was approximately 795 kilograms. Jon Brower Minnoch, who weighed only about 10 pounds at the time of his death, would have weighed significantly less than 10 kilograms. Given his extreme underweight condition, it is highly improbable that he could have exerted enough force to break a chair, let alone a spacecraft.

"To compare the shelf space requirements of the Library of Alexandria and the Library of Congress, we need to consider the scale and scope of each library's collection.

The Library of Alexandria, existing from the 3rd century BC to the 5th century AD, was a vast repository of knowledge, but its exact size and the number of scrolls it housed are not definitively known. Estimates suggest it could have contained tens of thousands of scrolls, but the physical space required for such a collection is not well-documented.

In contrast, the Library of Congress, established in 1800, is the largest library in the world. It is located in Washington, D.C., and houses over 170 million items, including books, manuscripts, and other materials. The sheer volume and diversity of the collection necessitate a significant amount of physical space.

Given the vast difference in the number of items and the size of the collections, it is highly improbable that the Library of Alexandria would need less shelf space than the Library of Congress.

Therefore, the answer is:

(A) No"

An armadillo's shell is indeed a robust and protective feature, but it is not suitable as a shield for a human for several reasons:

1. **Size and Weight**: The shell is relatively small and lightweight, which means it would not provide adequate protection against most types of attacks or projectiles.
2. **Mobility**: Armadillos are not designed to move quickly or maneuver in complex ways, making it impractical to use them as a shield in various situations.
3. **Durability**: While the shell is tough, it is not indestructible and could be damaged or broken, leaving the user exposed.
4. **Versatility**: A human would need a shield that can be used in various situations, such as in a fight, a confrontation, or self-defense. An armadillo's shell is not versatile enough for these purposes.

Therefore, an armadillo's shell is not a practical or effective shield for a human."

Wool can typically be machine washed, but it's important to handle it with care. Here are some considerations:

1. **Machine Washing**: Use a gentle cycle and a wool or delicates detergent. Avoid fabric softeners, as they can damage the wool fibers.
2. **Hand Washing**: Hand washing is also an option, especially for delicate items or when you want to ensure the garment is treated with extra care. Use a gentle detergent and a basin or sink with enough water to submerge the garment. Gently agitate the wool in the water, then rinse thoroughly.
3. **Drying**: Wool should be air-dried or tumble-dried on a low heat setting. Avoid drying wool in direct sunlight, as it can cause color fading and shrinkage.
4. **Ironing**: Wool can be ironed, but it's best to do so on a low heat setting and using a pressing cloth to protect the fabric.

So, while wool can be machine washed, it's not necessary to hand wash it only. The choice between machine washing and hand washing depends on the specific garment and your preference for care."

Ahimsa, a principle of non-violence and non-harm, is indeed central to several religious traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. However, it is important to note that Ahimsa is not a universal principle in all religions. Christianity, in which Paul the Apostle was a significant figure, does not have Ahimsa as a core tenet in the same way it is found in the aforementioned traditions.

Paul the Apostle, whose real name was Saul, was stoned to death in Rome around 64 AD. This act was not a result of a violent confrontation but rather a political decision to execute him. The principle of Ahimsa, which emphasizes non-violence and non-harm, does not apply to this historical event.

Therefore, the cause of Paul the Apostle's death did not violate the tenets of Ahimsa. The correct answer is:

(A) No"

"During a pandemic, door-to-door advertising can indeed be considered inconsiderate for several reasons:

1. **Health Risks**: Door-to-door canvassing involves close contact with individuals, which can increase the risk of spreading the virus, especially among those at higher risk due to age or pre-existing health conditions.

2. **Social Distancing**: The practice often involves standing close to people's homes, which goes against the social distancing guidelines recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.

3. **Public Health Concerns**: During a pandemic, public health officials are urging people to stay at home and limit their interactions to reduce the spread of the virus. Door-to-door canvassing can be seen as a disruption to this effort.

4. **Privacy Concerns**: People may feel uncomfortable or annoyed by door-to-door canvassing, especially if they are already dealing with stress and anxiety related to the pandemic.

In Japan, the feudal system, known as the Bakufu system, was distinct from the English feudal system. While it involved a form of dependency, it was not characterized by the same level of personal servitude as English serfdom. English serfs were bound to the land and had limited rights, whereas Japanese peasants, known as ""ronin"" or ""shizoku,"" had more autonomy and were not as strictly tied to the land. Therefore, the status of Japanese serfdom, if one can even call it that, was not higher than that of English serfdom.

The correct answer is:
