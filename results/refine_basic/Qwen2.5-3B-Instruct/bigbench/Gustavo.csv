"Given the clues, let's break it down:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. This means the person driving a truck must live in house 1 because the person driving a truck is the only other car type left.

From Clue 1, the person driving a convertible must live directly left of the history book buff. Since the person driving a truck is in house 1, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2. Therefore, the history book buff must be in house 1.

So, the person in house 1 (convertible driver) is a mystery book reader and is wearing sandals. The person in house 2 (truck driver) is a history book buff and is wearing boots.

Thus, the person who is wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
The correct option is (B) 3.
"Given the clues, let's break down the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. **Clue 3**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the person who likes yellow. Since they cannot be in the second house, they must be in either the first or the third house.

### Case 1: The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a gameboy must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who likes green).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

### Case 2: The person who likes yellow is in house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house (reaffirmed).
6. **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house (reaffirmed).
8. **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover is in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses. Since the root beer lover is in the third house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the first and second houses or the second and third houses. However, the third house is occupied by the root beer lover, so they must be in the first and second houses.

From Clue 4, the romance book lover does not live in the first house, so the romance book lover must be in the second house. This means the history book buff must be in the first house.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house, so the tea drinker must be in the first house. This contradicts the placement of the romance book lover and the history book buff. Therefore, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house, which is occupied by the root beer lover. This means the person who likes red is not in the third house, so the person who likes red must be in the first house.

From Clue 2, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Since the root beer lover is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 1, there are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who likes white must be in the second house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house numbers:

1. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.**
   - This means the person in house 1 is a fantasy book enthusiast.

2. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the fish enthusiast must live in house 2.

3. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who had pizza must live in house 2.

4. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
   - Since the person who likes green lives in house 2 (from clue 3), the person who has a radio must live in house 1.

From these deductions:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who had pizza (in house 2) and the person who likes green (in house 2) are already determined, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in house 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in house 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in house 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

From Clue 1, we know the person in house 1 has a phone. From Clue 2, the person in house 2 does not wear boots. From Clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other.

Since the person in house 1 has a phone, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

The characteristics are:
- House 1: Owns horses, wears high heels, has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots, has a phone.

Thus, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Pianist does not live in the first house.**
2. **Person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.**
3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other. Also, the person eating kiwis must be to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio next to each other. Also, the person eating oranges must be directly left of the person with a television.

- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, we need to place the person with a television directly left of the person with a radio.

- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Thus, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The correct answer is (A) 8."

4. **House 2: Running shoes (Person who is wearing running shoes)**

5. **House 3: Green (Person who likes green)**

6. **House 5: Blue (Person who likes blue)**

7. **There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.**

   - This means the person who owns a sedan must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 1 is already occupied by the SUV, the sedan must be in House 2. This leaves House 3 for the person who likes green.

8. **The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.**

   - This means the person who drives a truck must be in House 4 or House 5. Since House 4 is already occupied by the white person, the truck must be in House 5.

9. **The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.**

   - This means the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4, and the truck must be in House 5.

10. **The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.**

    - This means the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 or House 2, and the person who likes red must be in House 3 or House 4. Since House 1 and House 2 are already occupied, the yellow person must be in House 2, and the red person must be in House 3.

11. **The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.**

    - This means the person who is wearing boots must be in House 1, and the truck must be in House 5.

12. **The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.**

    - This is already confirmed as House 4.

13. **There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.**

    - This is already confirmed as House 3 (green) and House 5 (truck).

14. **The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.**

    - This is already confirmed as House 1 is occupied by the SUV.

From the above deductions, the person who is wearing boots must live in House 1.

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.

8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."

   - This means the saxophonist is in house 2.

3. **Clue 8:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
   - Since the saxophonist is in house 2, the pizza eater must be in house 3 or 4. But since the tea drinker is in house 4, the pizza eater must be in house 3.

4. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - This means the cellist and the person who ate fried rice must be in adjacent houses.

5. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - This means the person who only drinks water and the person who is wearing loafers must be in adjacent houses.

6. **Clue 5:** The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker.
   - Since the tea drinker is in house 4, the cellist must be in house 3.

7. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the pizza eater is in house 3, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

8. **Clue 4:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - Since the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1, the person who had stew must be in house 2 or 3. But since the saxophonist is in house 2, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

9. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
   - This means the person who likes milk must be in a house to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.

10. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - Since the person who is wearing sandals is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 2. This means the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 3.

11. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
    - Since the cellist is in house 3, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 4.

From the above analysis, we can conclude that the cellist lives in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the cellist lives is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.

9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the minivan driver lives in house 4. From Clue 10, the root beer lover lives in house 3. Now, let's use Clue 8 to determine the position of the basketball player and the truck driver. Since the basketball player lives directly left of the truck driver, and the truck driver must be in house 1 (as house 4 is taken by the minivan driver), the basketball player must be in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the truck driver.

Now, we know the following:
- House 1: Truck driver
- House 2: Basketball player
- House 3: Root beer lover
- House 4: Minivan driver

From Clue 3, the swimmer lives directly left of the sedan owner. Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 2 (already occupied by the basketball player), and the sedan owner must be in house 4 (minivan driver). This leaves house 1 for the truck driver.

From Clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other. Since the root beer lover is in house 3 and the sedan owner (sedan driver) is in house 4, the daffodils and lilies must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the basketball player is in house 2, the lilies must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies (house 3) lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player (house 2). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player must be in houses that are not adjacent. Since the root beer lover is in house 3 and the sedan owner is in house 4, the coffee drinker and the tennis player must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the truck driver is in house 1 and the basketball player is in house 2, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 and the tennis player must be in house 2.

From Clue 6, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the tennis player is in house 2 and the root beer lover is in house 3, the tea drinker must be in house 4.

Thus, the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(A) 1**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person driving a minivan.
3. The person driving a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
5. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From Clue 1, the tea drinker is in house 1.

From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.

From Clue 3, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 5, the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's test the possible positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1 (Clue 5), then the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
2. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red (in house 2) lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the person who likes white. Since the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house (Clue 2), and the person who likes white is in house 1, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in house 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the placement step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.
   - This directly tells us that the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

2. **Clue 2**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - If the SUV owner is in house 3, the person in house 2 must be the mystery book reader, and the person in house 1 must be the person who drives a convertible.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - Since the SUV owner is in house 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 2. But house 1 is already taken by the person who drives a convertible, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - The person who drives a convertible is in house 1, so the person who is eating mangos must be in house 2.

5. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - The person who drives a minivan must be in house 2 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible), and the dog owner must be in house 3.

6. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
   - The person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible, house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, and house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV). The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 4. Since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, the bird keeper must be in house 4.

7. **Clue 8**: The bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The bird keeper is in house 4, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. But house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to recheck the placement.

8. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - The person who drives a minivan is in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, the history book buff must be in house 1.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1 (since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos), and the romance book lover must be in house 4.

10. **Clue 11**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
    - The person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 3, and the person who is eating grapes must be in house 4.

Given all these clues, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Person who drives a convertible
- House 2: Person who is eating mangos
- House 3: Person who owns an SUV
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
   - This means the golfer must be in House 2 and the science fiction book fanatic in House 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - This means the pizza-eater and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the golfer is in House 2, the pizza-eater and history book buff must be in House 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
   - This means the guitarist and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can deduce:
- House 1: Pizza-eater (PE), History book buff (HBB)
- House 2: Golfer (G)

Now, considering Clue 3:
- The guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) must be in adjacent houses, and the guitarist must be to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils.

Given the positions of the golfer and the pizza-eater/history book buff, the only remaining positions for the guitarist and the person with the bouquet of daffodils are:
- House 1: PE, HBB
- House 2: Golfer (G)

Since the guitarist must be to the right of the person with the bouquet of daffodils, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 1: PE, D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- House 2: Golfer (G), Guitarist (Guitarist)

Therefore, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1.

Final answer: (B) 1"

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The person with the radio lives somewhere to the right of the person eating apples.
2. The person with the radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
4. The basketball player does not live in the first house.

From Clue 3, we know the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. So, house 1 is occupied by the person with the bouquet of lilies.

From Clue 4, the basketball player cannot live in house 1, so the basketball player must live in house 2.

Now, considering Clue 1 and Clue 2 together:
- The person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples.
- The person with the radio lives to the right of the violinist.

This means the person eating apples must be to the left of both the violinist and the person with the radio. Since the person with the bouquet of lilies is in house 1, the person eating apples must be in house 1 as well. Therefore, the violinist must be in house 2.

Thus, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"The cricketer lives in the 2nd house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is **(A) 2**."
"The root beer lover lives in house number 3.

(C) 3"
"Given the clues, let's break it down:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is:

"Given the constraints and the clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses. We'll start by analyzing the clues and placing the people accordingly.

6. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

13. **Clue 12**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
14. **Clue 14**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house.

From Clue 14, we know the person who is wearing loafers lives in house 4. This means the person who likes white cannot be in house 4.

From Clue 13, the person who likes white must be in one of the first three houses (1, 2, or 3).

From Clue 1, the person who is wearing sandals must be in one of the first three houses (1, 2, or 3) and the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the last three houses (3, 2, or 1).

From Clue 2, the person who had stew must be in one of the first three houses (1, 2, or 3) and the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the last three houses (3, 2, or 1).

From Clue 3, the person who had stew must be in one of the first three houses (1, 2, or 3) and the person who ate spaghetti must be in one of the last three houses (3, 2, or 1).

From Clue 4, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in one of the first three houses (1, 2, or 3) and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in one of the last three houses (3, 2, or 1).

From Clue 5, the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 6, the person who likes white must be in one of the first three houses (1, 2, or 3).

From Clue 7, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in one of the first three houses (1, 2, or 3) and the guitarist must be in one of the last three houses (3, 2, or 1).

From Clue 8, the person who likes green must be in one of the first three houses (1, 2, or 3) and the pianist must be in one of the last three houses (3, 2, or 1).

From Clue 9, there are two houses between where the person who likes green lives and where the pianist lives.

From Clue 10, the person who likes green must be in one of the first three houses (1, 2, or 3) and the person who likes green must be in one of the first three houses (1, 2, or 3).

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue must be in one of the first three houses (1, 2, or 3) and the person who had pizza must be in one of the last three houses (3, 2, or 1).

By process of elimination and logical deduction, we can determine that the person who likes white must be in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes white lives is **3**.

**Option (A) 3**"
"The person who only drinks water lives in House 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives.
5. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.
7. The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.

From Clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese (in house 1) and the person who likes white (in house 2) are adjacent.

From Clue 5, the person who is eating apples (in house 2) lives to the right of the soccer player (in house 3).

From Clue 4, there is one house between the person who has a radio (in house 2) and the person who has a computer (in house 3).

From Clue 2, the person who had pizza (in house 1) lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer (in house 3).

Given all these constraints, we can conclude that the person who likes red lives in house number 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow. So, the third house is:
- Yellow

From clue 3, the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer. So, the second house is:
- Root beer

From clue 1, the person who likes blue must be to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the yellow person is in the third house, the blue person must be in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the person who likes white must be to the right of the person who only drinks water. This doesn't directly place the white person, but it helps us understand the order.

From clue 2, the person who likes milk must be to the right of the person who likes yellow. Since the yellow person is in the third house, the milk person must be in the fourth house, which is also the house of the blue person.

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"The bird keeper lives in house 3.

So, the correct answer is (B) 3."

23. The bird keeper lives in the second house.
24. The guitarist lives in the first house.

From the deductions, the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper, and the bird keeper lives in the second house. Therefore, the tennis player must live in the first house.

The number of the house where the tennis player lives is 1. 

So, the correct answer is (A) 1."
The number of the house where the history book buff lives is **3**.
"Given the clues, let's break it down:

1. The cellist lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. The dog owner does not live in the first house.

From the first clue, if the cellist is in house 1, the gameboy owner must be in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the dog owner, but that contradicts the second clue that the dog owner does not live in the first house.

Therefore, the cellist must be in house 2, and the gameboy owner must be in house 1. This leaves house 2 for the dog owner.

So, the number of the house where the dog owner lives is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The person with a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the phone and SUV must be adjacent, with the phone to the left of the SUV.

4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

From the above, we know:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be adjacent to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 2: Phone
- House 4: SUV

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."

"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).

From the first clue, if the person who ate fried rice is in house 2, then the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1. This is because the fried rice eater is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is (B) 1."
"The dog owner lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

5. **Clue 4**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

6. **Clue 1**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

7. **Clue 3**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater
- The guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.
- The percussionist and science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"The person who owns horses lives in House 3.

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement looks like this:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
3. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water lives in house 1. From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2. This means the person who likes milk must be in house 3 because there is one house between house 1 and house 3. 

Now, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (C) 1."

4. **Clue 5:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and since the romance book lover is directly left of the history book buff, the only possible arrangement for houses 2 and 3 is:
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: History book buff

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in house 1, so the person who had pizza must live in either house 2 or house 3. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who ate fried rice must live somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 3.

Therefore, the arrangement is:

"The person who is eating oranges lives in house number 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"The person who is eating apples lives in house number 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"The person who had pizza lives in House 4.

So, the correct answer is (A) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 7:** The saxophonist lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 6:** The saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
5. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
6. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives.
7. **Clue 1:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

From Clue 5 and Clue 7, we know the fourth house is occupied by the mystery book reader and the saxophonist. Since the saxophonist and the violinist live directly next to each other, the violinist must be in the third house.

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- The saxophonist is in the fourth house.
- The violinist is in the third house.
- The history book buff and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, with one house between them. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the history book buff and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2.
- The romance book lover must be in house 2 (since the romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast).
- The fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 5 (since the mystery book reader is in house 4 and the romance book lover is in house 2).

So, the positions are:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Violinist
- House 4: Saxophonist
- House 5: Fantasy book enthusiast

Therefore, the number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"The person who has a gameboy lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"The person who is wearing high heels lives in house number 2.

So, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 2"
"The person who had pizza lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 3."
"The person eating apples lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 15:** The person who has a radio lives in the first house (House 1).
2. **Clue 5:** The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house (House 4).
3. **Clue 16:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in House 4, the person with a television must be in House 5.
4. **Clue 17:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given Clue 15, the person with a radio is in House 1, and the person with a computer cannot be in House 3 (Clue 9), so the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in Houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since the coffee drinker is in House 4, the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in Houses 2 and 3.
5. **Clue 14:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the basketball player and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given the possible placements, the only valid pair is (2, 3).
6. **Clue 13:** The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. This means the person who drives a minivan and the root beer lover must be in adjacent houses. Given Clue 12, the person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other, so the person who drives a minivan must be in House 2 and the basketball player in House 3. The root beer lover must be in House 4.
7. **Clue 12:** The person who drives a minivan and the basketball player live directly next to each other. This means the person who drives a minivan must be in House 2, and the basketball player must be in House 3.
8. **Clue 11:** The person who owns an SUV does not live in the fourth house. This means the person who owns an SUV must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Given Clue 10, the person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who likes red must be in House 2, and the golfer must be in House 3.
9. **Clue 10:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who likes red must be in House 2, and the golfer must be in House 3.
10. **Clue 9:** The person who has a computer does not live in the third house. This means the person who has a computer must be in House 1, 2, or 5. Given Clue 10, the person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who likes red must be in House 2, and the golfer must be in House 3.
11. **Clue 8:** The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes milk must be in House 5, and the person who likes yellow must be in House 4.
12. **Clue 6:** The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. This means the person who likes yellow must be in House 4, and the cricketer must be in House 5.
13. **Clue 7:** The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer. This means the person who owns a sedan must be in House 1, and the swimmer must be in House 2.
14. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a phone. This means the person who likes green and the person who has a phone must be in adjacent houses. Given the possible placements, the only valid pair is (2, 3) or (3, 4). Given Clue 2, the person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible. This means the person who likes green must be in House 3, and the person who drives a convertible must be in House 1.
15. **Clue 3:** The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house. This means the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 or 5. Given Clue 8, the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes milk must be in House 5, and the person who likes yellow must be in House 4.
16. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. This means the person who likes yellow must be in House 4, and the person who likes white must be in House 5.
17. **Clue 10:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the golfer. This means the person who likes red must be in House 2, and the golfer must be in House 3.

From the above deductions, the coffee drinker lives in House 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is **4**.

The correct answer is (E) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. The person with the vase of tulips does not live in the third house.
2. The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
3. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1, the sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors), and the lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1). The tulip person must live in house 2, but this is a contradiction because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3, the sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors), and the lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3). The tulip person must live in house 2, but this is a contradiction because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2, the sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors), and the lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2). The tulip person must live in house 1, but this is a contradiction because the tulip person cannot be in house 1.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1, the sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors), and the lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1). The tulip person must live in house 2, but this is a contradiction because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3, the sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors), and the lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3). The tulip person must live in house 2, but this is a contradiction because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the refined approach, let's deduce the correct house for the person who likes milk.

1. **House 4: Lilies**
2. **House 5: Tulips**
3. **House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
4. **House 2: Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
5. **House 1: Fantasy Book Enthusiast or Root Beer Lover**
6. **House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
7. **House 4: Rose Bouquet**
8. **House 5: Milk Lover**
9. **House 1: Romance Book Lover (Not 3)**
10. **House 2: Carnations**
11. **House 3: Mystery Book Reader**
12. **House 4: Carnations**
13. **House 5: History Book Buff**
14. **House 1: Daffodils**
15. **House 2: Pianist**
16. **House 3: Violinist**
17. **House 4: Rose Bouquet**
18. **House 5: Milk Lover**

From the above deductions, the person who likes milk lives in **House 5**. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 5."
"The basketball player lives in the second house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2."
"The person who likes blue lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (number 1), which contradicts the fantasy book enthusiast. Therefore, we need to reassess.
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1), the person who likes green must live in the second house (number 2), and the person who likes red must live in the first house (number 1). This means the cellist cannot be in the first house, so the cellist must be in the second house (number 2).

Now, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green.
- The person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

The mystery book reader must live in the second house (number 2).

Therefore, the number of the house where the mystery book reader lives is **2**."
"Given the constraints and the process of elimination, let's deduce the correct placement of the people in the houses. Here's a step-by-step deduction based on the clues:

16. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
17. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

Let's start by placing the people based on the constraints:

- **Golfer and person eating pizza** must be adjacent.

- House 1: Mystery book reader (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

10. **Banana between pizza and pianist.**
11. **Two houses between banana and pianist.**
12. **Pizza to the right of saxophonist.**
13. **Pizza not in House 5.**

From clue 11, there are two houses between where the person who is eating a banana lives and where the pianist lives. This means the pianist can't be in House 1, and the banana can't be in House 5. Let's place the pianist and banana:

- If the pianist is in House 2, the banana must be in House 4 (since there are two houses between them).
- If the pianist is in House 3, the banana must be in House 5 (but this is not possible as the pianist cannot be in House 5).
- If the pianist is in House 4, the banana must be in House 2 (but this is not possible as the pianist cannot be in House 4).

So, the pianist must be in House 2, and the banana must be in House 4.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Apples
- House 3: Not daffodils
- House 4: Banana
- House 5: Not daffodils

Since the pianist is in House 2 and the banana is in House 4, the saxophonist must be in House 5 (since the saxophonist must be to the right of the guitarist, and the guitarist cannot be in House 3).

This leaves us with:
- House 3: Daffodils
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Apples
- House 4: Banana
- House 5: Not daffodils (so it must be tulips)

The remaining person must be the one with the rose bouquet, which must be in House 3 (since daffodils are next to roses).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Apples
- House 3: Daffodils
- House 4: Banana
- House 5: Tulips

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. **Clue 12**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. **Clue 11**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 13**: The guitarist lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
5. **Clue 14**: There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
6. **Clue 2**: There are two houses between where the person who likes blue lives and where the person who likes green lives.

Let's start with Clue 3: The history book buff lives in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the history book buff.

Now, let's use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to place the person who had pizza and the person who ate spaghetti. Since there is one house between the history book buff and the person who ate spaghetti, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the third house, and the person who had pizza must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement so far is:
1. Pizza
2. History book buff
3. Spaghetti
4. ?

Next, let's use Clue 13 to place the guitarist and the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the guitarist is directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips, the guitarist must be in the first house, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house. But we already have the history book buff in the second house, so the guitarist must be in the second house, and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the third house.

2. **Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

- **Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
  - If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
  - If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

- **Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
  - If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.
  - If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

- **Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
  - If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
  - If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).
- There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (Clue 4).

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who likes red:

1. The person who likes red lives in the third house (Clue 8 and Clue 1).
2. The person who has a television lives in the third house (Clue 10).
3. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow (Clue 10).

From these clues, we can conclude that the person who likes red lives in the third house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is 3.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the root beer lover lives is:

(A) 1"
"The person who has the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4."

"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people. From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."
"The romance book lover lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (B) 2."
"The person who has a phone lives in House 1. Therefore, the correct option is:

(A) 1"

   - This means if the person wearing sandals is in house 1, the person liking yellow must be in house 2.
   - If the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person liking yellow must be in house 1.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

So, we have:
- House 1: Person drinking water, Person wearing sandals
- House 2: Person eating kiwis, Person liking yellow

Since the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).

Therefore, the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues and deductions, the person who is eating a banana must live in the fifth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 5"
"Given the clues, let's break it down:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means the bird keeper cannot be in house 2, so the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2.

2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.
   - Since the percussionist cannot be in house 2, the percussionist must be in house 1.

This leaves:
- The percussionist in house 1.
- The grilled cheese eater in house 2.
- The bird keeper in house 1 (but since the grilled cheese eater is already in house 2, the bird keeper must be in house 1, and the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2).

This leaves the guitarist and the pizza eater to be placed in the remaining houses (houses 1 and 2). Since the percussionist is in house 1, the guitarist must be in house 2 (because the guitarist cannot be in house 1, and the pizza eater cannot be in house 2).

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover lives in the first house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 3, we know the root beer lover lives in house 1. From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water lives in house 2. From Clue 4, the person who has a television cannot live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3. From Clue 5, if the person with the television lives in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 (which contradicts Clue 2). Therefore, the person with the television must live in house 3.

This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the person who likes root beer.

"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader. This means the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2.
2. **Clue 2**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.
3. **Clue 3**: The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, but not in the order of Clue 2. Therefore, the root beer lover must be in house 1 and the guitarist must be in house 2.

From this, we can deduce:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this scenario is not possible.

2. **Clue 2**: The dog owner does not live in the second house.
   - This means the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 3 if the dog owner lives in house 1, and in house 3 or house 2 if the dog owner lives in house 2.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

- If the dog owner is in house 1:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1).
  - The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 1.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 (Clue 3).

- If the dog owner is in house 3:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The bird keeper must be in house 1 or house 2.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 3.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 (Clue 3).

From the above analysis, the only consistent scenario is when the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**.

So, the correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues and the process of elimination, we can deduce the following arrangement:

1. **House 1:** Basketball Player
2. **House 2:** Computer
3. **House 3:** Banana
4. **House 4:** Rose Bouquet

The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 1, as they cannot be in House 2 (Clue 5).

Therefore, the person who is wearing sandals lives in House 1.

The answer is: **(A) 1**."
"The bird keeper lives in house 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the only possible adjacent houses are the second and third houses.

From Clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in the third house, and the history book buff must live in the second house.

This leaves the romance book lover to live in the first house, but we already know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

Thus, the romance book lover must live in the third house.

So, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person eating apples lives directly left of the person drinking water.
3. The person eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in house 2.

From Clue 3, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 1 or 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 6, the person eating kiwis cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2 or 4. Since the mangos eater is in house 4, the kiwis eater must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be to the left of the person drinking water. This means the apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the mangos eater is in house 4, the apple eater must be in house 1 and the water drinker in house 2.

This leaves house 3 for the tea drinker.

So, the coffee drinker lives in house 2.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"The person who is eating a banana lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"The correct option is (C) 1.

To elaborate on the reasoning without referencing the previous response:

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. Clue 6 tells us the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the flutist must be in house 1 and the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2.
2. Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. Therefore, the truck must be in house 3.
3. Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. Since the truck is in house 3, the gameboy must be in house 2 (but we already know the minivan is in house 2, so this is a contradiction unless we consider the order of the houses).
4. Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 3.
5. Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the gameboy is in house 3, the person with the television must be in house 1 and the person with high heels must be in house 2.
6. Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 1.

Therefore, the answer is (C) 1."
"Given the constraints and the detailed clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement of each person and their belongings:

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house (house 5).
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (house 2).
3. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist, so the pianist must be in house 3.
4. **Clue 13**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils (house 2) lives directly left of the person who has a television (house 3).
5. **Clue 8**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.

8. **Clue 3**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
9. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
10. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 12**: The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.
12. **Clue 1**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:
- House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pianist
- House 5: Grapes

Since the person who is eating grapes lives in house 5, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since they live directly left of the saxophonist, and the saxophonist must be in house 3).

Now, we need to place the remaining people:
- House 1: Violinist (since the violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other, and the violinist must be in house 1).
- House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pianist
- House 5: Grapes

The remaining person (the person who is eating mangos) must be in house 1 (since the person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the violinist, and the violinist is in house 1).

So, the person who is eating apples must be in house 3 (since the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist, and the pianist is in house 4).

Phileas Fogg's around the world journey, as described in Jules Verne's novel, would indeed be difficult to achieve during Pope John Paul I's reign. The Pope's brief time in office, from August 26, 1978, to September 28, 1978, coincided with the early days of modern air travel. While air travel had begun to develop, it was not yet as widespread or efficient as it is today.

Therefore, while raw carrots are nutritious, they may not be the best choice for maximizing vitamin A intake due to the lower bioavailability of the vitamin in its raw form."
