Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. The flutist lives in house number 2.
2. The person with the vase of tulips lives next to the guitarist.
3. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives next to the person with the carnations.
4. There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.

From clue 1, we know the flutist is in house number 2. So, the pianist must be in either house number 3 or house number 4.

If the pianist is in house number 3, then the guitarist must be in house number 2, but that would mean the guitarist and the person with the vase of tulips can't be next to each other, so that can't be right.

So, the pianist must be in house number 4. This means the guitarist is in house number 3.

Now, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in house number 1 because they have to be next to the person with the carnations, and house number 2 is taken by the flutist.

This leaves house number 4 for the person with the vase of tulips.

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house number 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know some things about the people:

1. One person eats kiwis, one eats grapes, and one eats oranges.
2. One person drinks root beer, one drinks water, and one drinks coffee.
3. One person likes blue, one likes white, and one likes green.
4. One person plays guitar, one plays cello, and one plays percussion.
5. One person has a TV, one has a phone, and one has a gameboy.

We also have some clues:

1. The root beer drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who eats grapes.
2. The TV person lives somewhere to the left of the root beer drinker.
3. The person who drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the root beer drinker.
4. There is one house between where the cello player lives and where the person with the gameboy lives.
5. The person who likes green lives in the first house.
6. The person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. The percussionist does not live in the second house.
8. The person who eats kiwis lives in the first house.

Now, let's figure out where everyone lives:

- The person who eats kiwis lives in the first house.
- The person who likes green lives in the first house.
- So, the first house is for the person who eats kiwis and likes green.

Since the person who likes green lives in the first house, the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3. Also, the person who drinks water must be to the left of the root beer drinker, and the root beer drinker must be to the left of the person who eats grapes.

Given that the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy are next to each other, and the percussionist is not in the second house, we can deduce:

- The first house (house 1) is for the person who eats kiwis and likes green.
- The second house (house 2) is for the person who likes blue and the person who has a gameboy.
- The third house (house 3) is for the person who drinks water, root beer, and the person who plays percussion.

Since the person who drinks water and the person who drinks root beer must be next to each other, and the percussionist is not in the second house, the only place left for the percussionist is in the third house.

So, the cellist must live in the third house.

The number of the house where the cellist lives is **(C) 3**."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives in the second house.
2. The person who likes kiwis lives in the fifth house.
3. The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes bananas.
5. The person who likes blue lives directly right of the person who likes red.
6. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
7. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
8. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes blue.
9. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes oranges.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who ate grilled cheese lives.

1. We know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5. So, that's our first clue.

2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house. So, the pizza eater can be in houses 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. The root beer lover lives next to the person who had stew. This means if the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who had stew is in house 2, and vice versa.

4. The person who only drinks water lives in house 5. So, house 5 is taken by the person who only drinks water.

5. The coffee drinker lives next to the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 or 4.

6. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live next to each other. Since the person who had stew is in house 1 and the person who likes milk is in house 2, this is already set.

So, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Person who only drinks water (already taken)

Since house 5 is taken by the person who only drinks water, and house 1 is taken by the person who had stew, the only house left for the person who ate grilled cheese is house 5.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5.

The answer is (A) 5."
"Let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives.

1. We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3.
2. The soccer player is somewhere to the left of the person eating oranges.
3. The swimmer and the person with daffodils are next to each other.
4. The person with tulips is somewhere to the right of the person eating mangos.
5. The person with daffodils is somewhere to the right of the person eating oranges.

First, let's think about the soccer player and the person eating oranges. They can't be in houses 1 and 3 because the soccer player has to be to the left of the person eating oranges. So, they must be in houses 1 and 2.

Now, let's think about the swimmer and the person with daffodils. They have to be next to each other. So, if the soccer player is in house 1, the person eating oranges must be in house 2, and the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2. But that's not possible because they can't be next to each other if they are in houses 1 and 2. So, the soccer player must be in house 2, and the person eating oranges must be in house 1. This means the swimmer and the person with daffodils must be in houses 1 and 2, but since the soccer player is in house 2, the swimmer must be in house 1 and the person with daffodils must be in house 2.

Next, let's think about the person with tulips. They have to be somewhere to the right of the person eating mangos. Since the person eating mangos is in house 1, the person with tulips must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person eating mangos
- House 2: Person with daffodils
- House 3: Person with tulips

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. The violinist lives in the first house.
2. The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone live next to each other.
3. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
4. The history book buff lives in the third house.
5. The person who ate spaghetti doesn't live in the second house.
6. The person who ate fried rice lives next to the percussionist.
7. There is one house between where the person with a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.
8. The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone are next to each other.
9. The person with a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the percussionist.

From these clues, we can figure out the following:

- The violinist is in the first house.
- The history book buff is in the third house.
- The person who ate spaghetti is in the first house (since they can't be in the second house).
- The person who ate fried rice is in the third house (since they can't be in the second house and must be next to the percussionist).
- The person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone are next to each other, and they can't be in the first house (where the violinist is) or the third house (where the history book buff is). So they must be in the second house.
- The person with a bouquet of daffodils is to the left of the percussionist, and the violinist is in the first house, so the bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

So, the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone are in the second house. This means the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step again, like I'm explaining it to someone in primary school.

1. We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it.
2. Each person has a different device, flower, musical instrument, pet, and likes a different kind of book.
3. We have some clues to figure out where each person lives.

Here are the clues again:
1. The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the second house.
3. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
4. The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
5. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
6. The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
8. The cellist does not live in the third house.

Now, let's figure it out:

- The mystery book reader lives in the second house. So, the second house is taken.
- The bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. So, the bird keeper must be in the third house.
- The fish enthusiast cannot be in the first house. So, the fish enthusiast must be in the first house.
- The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. Since the fish enthusiast is in the first house, the bouquet of lilies must be in the second house.
- The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Since the history book buff is in the second house, the computer must be in the third house.
- The cellist cannot be in the third house. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the cellist must be in the first house.
- The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the cellist is in the first house, the rose bouquet must be in the second house, and the gameboy must be in the first house.

So, the person who has a gameboy lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person who owns horses lives in house 3.
2. The person who has a radio and the person who has a carnations arrangement live next to each other.
3. The person who owns horses lives in house 3.
4. The dog owner lives next to the person who has a bouquet of lilies.

12. The person who eats bananas lives two houses away from the person who likes cats.
13. The person who eats bananas lives two houses away from the person who likes oranges.

- House 1: Person with a radio and person with carnations arrangement (next to each other)
- House 2: Person with a gameboy and person with a rose bouquet (next to each other)
- House 4: Person with a computer (not in house 5)
- House 5: Person with a phone

2. House 2 and 3: Gameboy and Rose bouquet (next to each other)
3. House 3: Horses
4. House 4: Computer
5. House 5: Phone

- House 1: Person with a radio and person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with a gameboy and person with a rose bouquet
- House 4: Person with a computer
- House 5: Person with a phone

We need to place the remaining fruits and pets:

Let's try:

- House 1: Person with a radio and person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with a gameboy and person with a rose bouquet
- House 4: Person with a computer
- House 5: Person with a phone

We need to place the remaining:

- House 1: Kiwis, bananas, oranges, apples, grapes
- House 2: Dog, cat, fish, bird, horses
- House 4: Dog, cat, fish, bird, horses
- House 5: Dog, cat, fish, bird, horses

Let's place the remaining:

- House 2: Cat
- House 4: Fish
- House 5: Bird

So, the person who has a phone lives in house 5.

The answer is: (A) 5"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have two houses, house 1 and house 2.
2. The person in house 2 is wearing boots. So, the person in house 1 is not wearing boots.
3. The person in house 1 is driving a convertible. So, the person in house 1 is not driving a truck.
4. The person in house 2 is reading history books. So, the person in house 2 is not reading mysteries.
5. The person in house 1 is driving a convertible and not wearing boots, so they must be wearing sandals.
6. The person in house 2 is reading history books and not wearing boots, so they must be driving a truck.

So, the person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The answer is: (A) 1"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. The swimmer can't be in the third house.
   - So, the swimmer can be in House 2 or House 4.

3. The mystery book reader is next to the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover can't be in House 1 or House 4 (because the swimmer can't be in House 3).

4. The mystery book reader is next to the history book buff.
   - So, the history book buff can't be in House 1 or House 4 (because the mystery book reader can't be in House 3).

5. The basketball player can't be in the fourth house.
   - So, the basketball player can be in House 1, House 2, or House 3.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left for the basketball player is House 2.

So, the basketball player lives in House 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the third house.
2. The person wearing high heels can't be in the second or fourth house.
3. The person wearing high heels can't be in the first house because the history book buff must be to the right of the person wearing loafers.
4. The person wearing sandals and the romance book lover must be in adjacent houses.
5. The person wearing high heels must be in the first house because the third house is taken by the mystery book reader.
6. The person wearing sandals must be in the second house because the first house is taken by the high heels person and the third house is taken by the mystery book reader.
7. The person wearing loafers must be in the fourth house because the second and fourth houses are left and the third house is taken.
8. The person wearing high heels (first house) and the person wearing loafers (fourth house) must be to the right of each other, so the person wearing loafers is in the fourth house.

So, the mystery book reader lives in the third house.

We have three houses, and we need to figure out which house the person with the computer lives in. Here are the clues:

1. The person who likes green lives next to the person who has a gameboy.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives next to the person who has a computer.
3. The person who likes yellow doesn't live in the second house.

Let's think about it step by step:

- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (because they are next to each other).
- If the person who likes green is in house 2, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 3 (because they are next to each other).
- If the person who has a gameboy is in house 3, then the person who has a computer must be in house 2 (because they are next to each other).

But wait! We know the person who likes yellow can't be in house 2. So, the person who likes yellow must be in house 3.

- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who likes green must be in house 2.
- If the person who likes green is in house 2, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 1.
- If the person who has a gameboy is in house 1, then the person who has a computer must be in house 2.

So, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."

7. The romance book lover and the history book buff are next to each other.
8. The tea drinker is not in the second house.
9. The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the root beer lover is in the third house. So, the third house is taken.

From clue 7, the romance book lover and the history book buff are next to each other. They can't be in the first or fourth house because the tea drinker can't be in the second house (clue 9).

So, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the first and fourth houses. But the fourth house is taken by the person who likes yellow (clue 6).

So, the romance book lover is in the first house and the history book buff is in the fourth house.

Now, the tea drinker can't be in the second house (clue 9), so the tea drinker must be in the first house. But the first house is taken by the romance book lover.

So, the tea drinker must be in the fourth house.

Now, the person who likes red is in the third house (clue 7).

The person who likes white lives two houses away from the coffee drinker. The only house left for the person who likes white is the second house.

So, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

4. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.

From clue 2, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. So, house 1 has:
- Fantasy book enthusiast
- Person who likes green
- Person who had pizza

From clue 3, the fish enthusiast lives in house 2. So, house 2 has:
- Fish enthusiast
- Person who has a radio
- Person who ate spaghetti

From clue 4, the person who had pizza does not live in house 1, so the person who had pizza must live in house 2. This means the person who had pizza is the person who ate spaghetti.

Now, we know the person who has a radio must be in house 1 because the person who likes green is directly left of the person who has a radio. So, the person who has a radio is the person who likes green.

This leaves the person who is a cat lover to live in house 1.

So, the number of the house where the cat lover lives is **1**."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person eating kiwis lives.

1. The person eating kiwis lives in the first house. (Clue 8)
2. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other. (Clue 10)
3. The person who only drinks water lives next to the person eating kiwis. (Clue 12)
4. The person eating kiwis is in the first house, so the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in the first and second houses.
5. The person who only drinks water must be in the second house because they live next to the person eating kiwis.
6. The person who likes milk can't be in the first or third house. (Clue 6 and 7)
7. The person who likes milk must be in the fourth house.
8. The cat lover lives in the first house, but the person eating kiwis is already there, so the cat lover can't be in the first house. This means the cat lover must be in the fourth house.

So, the houses are:
- House 1: Person eating kiwis
- House 2: Person drinking water
- House 3: Person drinking milk
- House 4: Person drinking root beer

The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person who had stew lives in.

We have 5 houses, and we need to figure out the arrangement based on the clues given. Here's how we can do it:

1. Grilled cheese and pizza are next to each other.
2. Grilled cheese and stew are next to each other.
3. Grilled cheese and tulips are next to each other.
4. Oranges are next to apples.
5. There are two houses between where oranges and kiwis live.
6. Oranges are next to carnations.
7. Apples are next to mangos.

Let's start by putting grilled cheese and pizza next to each other. We can put them in houses 1 and 2.

1. House 1: Grilled cheese
2. House 2: Pizza

Now, stew must be next to grilled cheese, so stew must be in house 2 or 3. But since pizza is already in house 2, stew must be in house 3.

1. House 1: Grilled cheese
2. House 2: Pizza
3. House 3: Stew

Now, we need to place oranges and apples next to each other. They can't be in house 5 because there are two houses between oranges and kiwis, and kiwis can't be in house 5. So, oranges and apples must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

Since grilled cheese is in house 1 and pizza is in house 2, oranges and apples can't be in houses 1 and 2. So, oranges and apples must be in houses 2 and 3.

1. House 1: Grilled cheese
2. House 2: Pizza
3. House 3: Stew
4. House 4: (We don't know yet)
5. House 5: Tulips

Now, oranges and kiwis need to be two houses apart. Since oranges are in house 2, kiwis must be in house 4.

1. House 1: Grilled cheese
2. House 2: Pizza
3. House 3: Stew
4. House 4: Kiwis
5. House 5: Tulips

Finally, oranges and carnations need to be next to each other, and oranges are in house 2. Carnations can't be in house 5, so carnations must be in house 1.

1. House 1: Grilled cheese
2. House 2: Pizza
3. House 3: Stew
4. House 4: Kiwis
5. House 5: Tulips

And apples and mangos need to be next to each other. Since grilled cheese is in house 1 and pizza is in house 2, apples and mangos must be in houses 3 and 4.

1. House 1: Grilled cheese
2. House 2: Pizza
3. House 3: Stew
4. House 4: Kiwis
5. House 5: Tulips

So, the person who had stew lives in house 3.

The answer is (D) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the fish enthusiast lives.

1. The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - So, the first house is for the cat lover.

2. The tulip owner lives next to the dog owner.
   - This means if the dog owner is in house 5, the tulip owner is in house 4.
   - If the dog owner is in house 4, the tulip owner is in house 3.
   - If the dog owner is in house 3, the tulip owner is in house 2.
   - If the dog owner is in house 2, the tulip owner is in house 1 (but house 1 is for the cat lover).

3. The daffodils owner is not in house 2.
   - So, the daffodils owner can be in house 1, 3, or 4.

4. There is one house between the horse owner and the carnations owner.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 3, the carnations owner is in house 4.
   - If the horse owner is in house 4, the carnations owner is in house 3 (but house 3 is for the horse owner).

5. The lilies owner is to the right of the horse owner.
   - This means if the horse owner is in house 3, the lilies owner is in house 4.
   - If the horse owner is in house 4, the lilies owner is in house 5.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Cat lover
- House 2: Daffodils (since the daffodils owner can't be in house 2)
- House 3: Horse (since the horse owner can't be in house 3 because there's no space for the carnations owner)
- House 4: Dog (since the dog owner can't be in house 4 because there's no space for the tulip owner)
- House 5: Fish (remaining pet)

So, the fish enthusiast lives in house 5.

The correct answer is (D) 4."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The person with a phone lives in the first house. So, the first house has a phone.
2. The person wearing boots doesn't live in the second house. So, the second house doesn't have boots.
3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other.

From Clue 1, we know the first house has a phone. So, the second house can't have a phone.

From Clue 2, the second house doesn't have boots, so the person in the second house must be wearing high heels.

From Clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other. Since the first house has a phone, the second house must have a radio. So, the person in the second house has a radio and the person in the first house owns horses.

This means the person in the first house wears high heels because the person in the second house wears boots.

So, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3.
2. Each person has a different shoe, favorite color, fruit, lunch, and device.
3. We need to figure out where the person who likes green lives.

### Clues Breakdown

1. Grilled cheese and computer live next to each other.
2. Grilled cheese does not live in house 3.
3. Apples do not live in house 1.
4. Apples live next to boots.
5. Blue and phone are one house apart.
6. Loafers and computer live next to each other.
7. Pizza does not live in house 2.
8. Mangos and yellow are next to each other.
9. Computer and phone live next to each other.
10. Grilled cheese and computer live next to each other.

### Deductions

- From clue 2, grilled cheese cannot be in house 3.
- From clue 3, apples cannot be in house 1.
- From clue 4, apples and boots must be next to each other.
- From clue 5, blue and phone are one house apart.
- From clue 6, loafers and computer are next to each other.
- From clue 7, pizza cannot be in house 2.
- From clue 8, mangos and yellow are next to each other.
- From clue 9, computer and phone are next to each other.
- From clue 10, grilled cheese and computer are next to each other.

### Possible Arrangements

Let's try to fit everything together:

1. Grilled cheese and computer are next to each other.
2. Grilled cheese cannot be in house 3.
3. Apples and boots are next to each other.
4. Blue and phone are one house apart.
5. Loafers and computer are next to each other.
6. Pizza is not in house 2.
7. Mangos and yellow are next to each other.
8. Computer and phone are next to each other.

Let's try house 1:
- If grilled cheese is in house 1, computer must be in house 2.
- If grilled cheese is in house 1, apples and boots must be in houses 1 and 2.
- If apples are in house 1, boots must be in house 2.
- If apples are in house 1, blue and phone must be in houses 2 and 3.
- If blue is in house 2, phone must be in house 3.
- If blue is in house 2, yellow must be in house 3.
- If yellow is in house 3, mangos must be in house 2.
- This creates a contradiction because computer and phone are next to each other, but computer is in house 2 and phone is in house 3.

Let's try house 2:
- If grilled cheese is in house 2, computer must be in house 1.
- If grilled cheese is in house 2, apples and boots must be in houses 1 and 3.
- If apples are in house 1, boots must be in house 3.
- If apples are in house 1, blue and phone must be in houses 1 and 3.
- If blue is in house 1, phone must be in house 3.
- If blue is in house 1, yellow must be in house 3.
- If yellow is in house 3, mangos must be in house 1.
- This creates a contradiction because computer and phone are next to each other, but computer is in house 1 and phone is in house 3.

Let's try house 3:
- If grilled cheese is in house 3, computer must be in house 2.
- If grilled cheese is in house 3, apples and boots must be in houses 1 and 2.
- If apples are in house 1, boots must be in house 2.
- If apples are in house 1, blue and phone must be in houses 1 and 2.
- If blue is in house 1, phone must be in house 2.
- If blue is in house 1, yellow must be in house 2.
- If yellow is in house 2, mangos must be in house 1.
- This fits all the clues.

So, the person who likes green must live in house 3.

The answer is: **(C) 3**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like we're in primary school.

We have 4 houses and 4 people with different sports and pets. We need to figure out which house the bird keeper lives in.

1. The baseball player is in the second house.
2. The basketball player is not in the first house.
3. The basketball player is to the left of the swimmer.
4. The fish enthusiast is to the right of the dog owner.
5. The bird keeper is not in the first house.
6. The tennis player is next to the cat lover.
7. The bird keeper is not in the third house.

Let's fill in the houses one by one:

- House 1: The bird keeper can't be here, so it's not the bird keeper.
- House 2: The baseball player is here.
- House 3: The fish enthusiast and the dog owner can't be here (because the bird keeper can't be here and the tennis player can't be here next to the cat lover).
- House 4: The cat lover and the fish enthusiast can't be here (because the bird keeper can't be here and the tennis player can't be here next to the cat lover).

So, the only house left for the bird keeper is House 1.

The bird keeper lives in House 1.

So, the answer is (D) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know some things about the people:

1. One person likes white, one likes blue, and one likes yellow.
2. One person drives a convertible, one owns an SUV, and one owns a sedan.
3. One person plays a violin, one plays a guitar, and one plays a saxophone.
4. One person has a computer, one has a television, and one has a gameboy.
5. One person plays baseball, one swims, and one plays soccer.

We have some clues to help us figure out where each person lives:

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a computer.
2. There is one house between where the baseball player lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
3. The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
4. The swimmer lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV.
5. The violinist does not live in the first house.
6. The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
7. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.

Now, let's think about it step by step:

- From clue 2, the baseball player and the person who likes blue must be in houses 2 and 3, with the baseball player in house 2 and the person who likes blue in house 3.
- From clue 1, the person who likes white must be in house 3 (because the computer owner can't be in house 1, and the white lover can't be in house 1 either).
- From clue 3, the sedan and SUV must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the person who likes blue is in house 3, the sedan must be in house 1 and the SUV in house 2.
- From clue 4, the swimmer must be in house 3 (because the person who owns an SUV is in house 2, and the swimmer must be to the right of the person who owns an SUV).
- From clue 5, the violinist can't be in house 1, so the violinist must be in house 2 or 3. But since the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
- From clue 6, the person who owns a sedan and the person who has a gameboy live next to each other. Since the sedan is in house 1, the gameboy must be in house 2.
- From clue 7, the guitarist must be in house 3 (because the person who likes white is in house 3, and the guitarist must be to the right of the person who likes white).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Computer owner
- House 2: Gameboy owner
- House 3: Person who likes white, violinist, and swimmer

The person who plays soccer must be in house 1.

So, the soccer player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

10. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. (Clue 10)
11. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. (Clue 11)

2. The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.
3. The pianist and the person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.

5. The person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.
6. The person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.
7. The person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.

Let's try to place the people in the houses:

- Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's start by putting the pianist in house 2.
- The pianist and the person wearing high heels are next to each other, so the person wearing high heels must be in house 3.
- The person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- The person eating kiwis is to the left of the person wearing boots.
- The person wearing high heels and the person with a radio are next to each other.
- The person eating oranges is directly left of the person with a television.

Let's try placing the remaining people:

- If the pianist is in house 2, the person wearing high heels is in house 3.
- The person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis must be in houses 4 and 5.
- The person eating kiwis is to the left of the person wearing boots, so the person eating kiwis is in house 4 and the person wearing boots is in house 6.
- The person wearing high heels and the person with a radio are next to each other, so the person with a radio is in house 5.
- The person eating oranges is directly left of the person with a television, so the person with a television is in house 7.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Not used
- House 2: Pianist
- House 3: Person wearing high heels
- House 4: Person eating oranges
- House 5: Person with a radio
- House 6: Person eating kiwis
- House 7: Person with a television
- House 8: Not used

Therefore, the person with the television lives in house 7.

The correct answer is (A) 7."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person who owns a sedan lives in.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a different person living in it with different things. Here are the clues again:

1. The tea drinker does not live in the first house.
2. The person who eats apples lives in the third house.
3. The person who likes red does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes milk and the person who eats a banana live next to each other.
5. The person who only drinks water lives next to the person who likes yellow.
6. There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who eats kiwis lives.
7. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
8. The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk.
9. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
10. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
11. The person who likes blue lives next to the person who drives a truck.
12. The person who eats mangos lives next to the person who likes green.
13. The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live next to each other.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes milk lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the milk drinker.

From clue 2, the person who eats apples also lives in the third house. This means there's a contradiction because the third house can't have two people living there. So, let's assume the person who eats apples lives in the third house, and the milk drinker lives in the third house, but they can't both be there. Let's move on to the other clues.

From clue 1, the tea drinker can't be in the first house.
From clue 3, the person who likes red can't be in the third house.
From clue 4, the person who likes milk and the person who eats a banana are next to each other.
From clue 5, the person who only drinks water and the person who likes yellow are next to each other.
From clue 6, there are two houses between the root beer lover and the person who eats kiwis.
From clue 8, the person who owns an SUV is to the right of the person who likes milk.
From clue 9, the person who likes red is to the left of the person who only drinks water.
From clue 10, the person who drives a convertible is to the left of the person who likes red.
From clue 11, the person who likes blue is next to the person who drives a truck.
From clue 12, the person who eats mangos is next to the person who likes green.
From clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow are next to each other.

Let's try to place the people step by step:

- The third house is occupied by the milk drinker.
- The person who eats apples is next to the milk drinker, so they could be in the second or fourth house.
- The person who likes red is to the left of the person who only drinks water.
- The person who drives a convertible is to the left of the person who likes red.
- The person who likes blue is next to the person who drives a truck.
- The person who eats mangos is next to the person who likes green.
- The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow are next to each other.

By placing the people step by step, we can find that the person who owns a sedan lives in the fourth house.

So, the answer is (A) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. We know the person eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The person eating bananas lives in the third house.
3. The person eating mangos must live in the second house because the first and third houses are taken.
4. The person driving a truck cannot live in the first or third house (Clue 1 and Clue 2).
5. Therefore, the person driving a truck must live in the second house.
6. The only house left for the person with the SUV is the first house.

So, the person who owns the SUV lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and we know some things about the people who live in them:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who ate fried rice.
3. The swimmer lives in the first house.
4. The cricketer doesn't live in the third house.

From clue 1, we know the third house is for the fried rice eater. From clue 2, the spaghetti eater must be in the second house because they live next to the fried rice eater. 

So, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."

2. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
3. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.

Let's fill in the houses we know for sure:
- House 5: Blue
- House 4: White

Now, we need to place the truck and sandals. Since the truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals, and the person who is wearing sandals must be to the right of the truck, we can place:
- House 4: White (already)
- House 3: Truck
- House 2: Sandals
- House 1: Boots
- House 5: Blue

So, the person who is wearing boots lives in House 1.

The answer is: (A) 1"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're solving a fun puzzle!

1. We know the history book buff lives in the first house. So, the history book buff is in house number 1.
2. The person who had stew lives in the third house because there's one house between the history book buff and the person who had stew.
3. The person who had pizza lives in the second house because there's one house between the person who had pizza and the person who had stew.

So, the history book buff lives in house number 1.

The answer is: (B) 1"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person eating apples lives in.

1. We know the soccer player lives in the first house.

"Let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who likes green lives.

1. We know the following:
   - House 2 has daffodils.
   - House 3 has loafers.
   - House 1 has lilies.
   - House 3 has a science fiction book fanatic.
   - House 1 has yellow (because it's next to the person with boots).
   - House 3 has blue (because it's next to the person with yellow).
   - House 3 has high heels (because it's next to the person with boots).
   - House 2 has a history book buff.
   - House 1 has a person who likes green.

So, we can fill in the houses as follows:
- House 1: Yellow, lilies, boots.
- House 2: History book buff, daffodils.
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic, lilies, high heels.

The person who likes green must be in House 1 because that's the only house left.

So, the number of the house where the person who likes green lives is 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

1. We know the person wearing running shoes lives in the first house. So, the first house is taken by the person with running shoes.
2. The person who owns a sedan can't be in the third house.
3. The person with running shoes and the person with boots live next to each other.
4. The person with sandals lives next to the person with a convertible.
5. The person with running shoes and the person with boots are next to each other.
6. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the people:

- The person with running shoes is in the first house.
- The person with boots is next to the person with running shoes, so they are in the second house.
- The person with sandals is next to the person with a convertible, so they are in the third house.
- The person with a convertible is next to the person with sandals, so they are in the fourth house.
- The person who owns an SUV is in the fourth house, but we already placed the convertible there, so the SUV must be in the fifth house.
- The person who owns a sedan can't be in the third house, so they must be in the fifth house.

So, the person with running shoes lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. The person who plays cricket lives in the first house. So, the first house is for the cricket player.
2. The person who owns a sedan lives next to the person who owns a horse.
3. The person who owns horses lives next to the person who owns a sedan.
4. The person who drives a truck lives next to the person who plays basketball.

From clue 2 and 3, we know the sedan and horse owners must be in houses 2 and 3. And since the horse owner is next to the sedan owner, they can't be in adjacent houses. So, one is in house 2 and the other in house 3.

From clue 4, the truck driver and the basketball player can't be in adjacent houses. Since the cricket player is in house 1, the truck driver and basketball player must be in houses 2 and 3.

If the sedan owner is in house 2, the horse owner must be in house 3. This means the basketball player must be in house 2 because the truck driver is next to the basketball player.

So, the basketball player lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in the 5th house.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler clues:

1. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

7. The person who is wearing loafers lives next to the person who ate grilled cheese.
8. The person who drives a convertible lives next to the person who only drinks water.
9. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Now, let's place the people based on these clues:

- House 3: Milk drinker (Clue 1)
- House 2: Running shoes (Clue 2)
- House 1: Root beer lover (Clue 4, since they live next to the fried rice eater)
- House 4: Fried rice eater (Clue 4, since they live next to the root beer lover)

So now we have:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water. Since the person who only drinks water lives next to the person who owns an SUV (Clue 5), and the person who drives a convertible lives next to the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Now, the only house left is House 1, and the person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3). So, the person who is wearing high heels must live in House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the person who owns an SUV must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: SUV owner

So, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have 4 houses and 4 people with different characteristics. We need to figure out which house the cellist lives in based on the clues.

1. The saxophonist lives in the second house.

3. The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.
4. The cellist lives directly next to the person who ate fried rice.
5. The person who only drinks water lives next to the person who wears loafers.

7. The person who wears running shoes lives in the first house.
8. The person who had pizza lives next to the saxophonist.
9. The flutist doesn't live in the fourth house.
10. The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.

From clue 1, we know the saxophonist is in the second house.
From clue 2, the pizza eater is in the third house.
From clue 3, the tea drinker is in the fourth house.
From clue 8, the pizza eater (in the third house) is next to the saxophonist (in the second house), so the pizza eater must be in the third house.
From clue 4, the cellist must be next to the person who ate fried rice.
From clue 5, the person who only drinks water and the person who wears loafers must be next to each other.
From clue 6, the person who wears sandals and the person who likes milk must be next to each other.
From clue 7, the cellist must be next to the person who ate fried rice.
From clue 10, the tea drinker is in the fourth house, so the cellist can't be in the fourth house.

Now, let's place the people:
- Second house: Saxophonist
- Third house: Pizza eater
- Fourth house: Tea drinker
- First house: Running shoes (we don't know who wears them yet)

Since the cellist must be next to the person who ate fried rice, and the pizza eater is in the third house, the cellist must be in the second house or the fourth house. But the fourth house is taken by the tea drinker, so the cellist must be in the second house.

So, the cellist lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the person who drives a truck lives.

From this, we can see that the truck driver must be in house 1 because house 1 is the only house left for the truck driver to live in.

So, the number of the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(A) 1**."

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, the tea drinker is in house 1.

2. The person who eats apples lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the person eating apples is in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan is in house 2 or 3.

3. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the person driving a convertible is in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house 1 or 2.

4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3, or 1 and 2.

- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

2. The mystery book reader lives directly to the left of the person who likes red. So, the mystery book reader must be in the first house.
3. The person who likes white can't be in the third house, so they must be in the first house.
4. That leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to be in the third house.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

The answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:

From clue 7, we know the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast.

From clue 2, the science fiction book fanatic must live somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the science fiction book fanatic can live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the person who is eating apples does not live in the third house. So, the person who is eating apples can live in the first or the second house.

From clue 5, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means mangos and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

From clue 3, the person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means apples and sandals must be in adjacent houses.

From clue 6, there is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives. This means if the person eating apples lives in the first house, the person wearing boots must live in the third house, but the third house is already taken by the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the person eating apples must live in the second house, and the person wearing boots must live in the fourth house.

From clue 8, the person who is eating a banana lives somewhere to the right of the fantasy book enthusiast. So, the person eating a banana must live in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person eating mangos
- Second house: Person eating apples

- Fourth house: Science fiction book fanatic
- Fifth house: Person eating a banana

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. The person who ate fried rice doesn't live in the first house. So, the person who ate fried rice must live in the second house.
2. The person who owns an SUV doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who owns an SUV must live in the first house.
3. The flutist lives next to the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the flutist must live in the first house.
4. The person who wears loafers lives next to the person who likes white. Since the person who likes white lives in the second house, the person who wears loafers must live in the first house.

So, we know:
- First house (number 1): Flutist, wears loafers, owns an SUV
- Second house (number 2): Person who likes white, wears sandals, owns an SUV

Therefore, the person who wears sandals lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way:

1. We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it.
2. Each person has different flowers, fruits, cars, musical instruments, and drinks.
3. We know some clues that help us figure out where each person lives.

Here are the clues again:
1. The person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan live next to each other.
2. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who eats mangos.
3. The person who only drinks water does not live in the first house.
4. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
5. The person who owns a sedan lives directly next to the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. The cellist lives directly next to the saxophonist.
7. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house.
8. The person who owns a sedan lives directly next to the person who eats apples.
9. The person who eats apples lives directly next to the violinist.

Now, let's figure out where each person lives:

- From clue 4, we know the root beer lover lives in house 3.
- From clue 1, the person who only drinks water and the person who drives a minivan must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who only drinks water does not live in house 1 (clue 3), the person who only drinks water must live in house 2, and the person who drives a minivan must live in house 1.
- From clue 5, the person who owns a sedan lives next to the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Since the sedan owner cannot be in house 1 (clue 2), the sedan owner must be in house 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3. But house 3 is already taken by the root beer lover, so the sedan owner must be in house 1, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.
- From clue 8, the person who owns a sedan lives next to the person who eats apples. Since the sedan owner is in house 1, the person who eats apples must be in house 2. But house 2 is already taken by the person with the bouquet of daffodils, so this is a contradiction. Let's recheck. The sedan owner is in house 1, and the person who eats apples must be in house 3.
- From clue 9, the person who eats apples lives next to the violinist. Since the person who eats apples is in house 3, the violinist must be in house 2.
- From clue 7, the person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the third house. Since the third house is taken by the root beer lover, the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Root beer lover

The violinist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the person wearing loafers lives.

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
   - So, house 3: Yellow

2. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
   - This means boots can't be in house 3, 4, or 5.

3. The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - So, if fish enthusiast is in house 1, phone is in house 2, and if fish enthusiast is in house 2, phone is in house 3, and so on.

4. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - So, if television is in house 1, fried rice is in house 2, and if television is in house 2, fried rice is in house 3, and so on.

5. The person who likes white does not live in the second house.
   - So, house 2: Not white

6. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
   - So, if sandals are in house 1, gameboy is in house 2, and if sandals are in house 2, gameboy is in house 3, and so on.

7. There is one house between where the person who ate spaghetti lives and where the person who is wearing loafers lives.
   - So, if spaghetti is in house 1, loafers is in house 3, and if spaghetti is in house 2, loafers is in house 4, and so on.

8. The person who had stew does not live in the third house.
   - So, house 3: Not stew

9. The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.
   - So, if cat lover is in house 1, loafers is in house 2, and if cat lover is in house 2, loafers is in house 3, and so on.

10. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
    - So, house 5: Grilled cheese

11. The cat lover lives directly left of the dog owner.
    - So, if cat lover is in house 1, dog owner is in house 2, and if cat lover is in house 2, dog owner is in house 3, and so on.

12. The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.
    - So, house 2: High heels

13. The person who likes red does not live in the fifth house.
    - So, house 5: Not red

14. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
    - So, if loafers are in house 4, gameboy is in house 5, and if loafers are in house 5, gameboy is in house 6, and so on.

15. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
    - So, if fish enthusiast is in house 1, radio is in house 2, and if fish enthusiast is in house 2, radio is in house 3, and so on.

16. The person who owns horses lives directly left of the person who has a television.
    - So, if horses are in house 1, television is in house 2, and if horses are in house 2, television is in house 3, and so on.

17. The person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.
    - So, house 4: Blue

18. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
    - So, house 3: Not boots

19. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
    - So, if white is in house 1, stew is in house 2, and if white is in house 2, stew is in house 3, and so on.

From all these clues, we can see that the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 5.

So, the answer is (E) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and two people. One has a computer, and one has a television. One has a bouquet of lilies, and one has a rose bouquet.

1. The person with lilies doesn't live in the first house.
2. The person with the television lives in the first house.

So, the first house has the television. That means the second house has the computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the percussionist lives.

1. The science fiction book fanatic lives somewhere to the left of the golfer.
2. The person who had pizza and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
3. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

We have two houses, House 1 and House 2. Let's try to place the people based on the clues:

- From clue 1, the science fiction book fanatic (SFF) and the golfer (Golfer) must be in different houses, and the golfer must be to the right of the SFF.
  - So, SFF is in House 1 and Golfer is in House 2.

- From clue 2, the person who had pizza (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) must be in adjacent houses.
  - Since SFF is in House 1, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.
  - So, PE is in House 1 and HBB is in House 2.

- From clue 3, the guitarist (G) and the person with a bouquet of daffodils (D) must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D.
  - Since Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.
  - So, G is in House 2 and D is in House 1.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: SFF (science fiction book fanatic), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- House 2: PE (person who had pizza), Golfer (golfer), HBB (history book buff)

The percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

The correct answer is: (B) 1"

"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the violinist lives.

1. The person with a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person eating apples.
2. The person with a radio lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. The person with a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
4. The basketball player does not live in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1. So, house 1 is:
- Lilies

From clue 4, the basketball player does not live in house 1, so the basketball player must live in house 2.

Now, let's look at clues 1 and 2 together. The person with the radio lives to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must be to the left of the violinist. Since the person eating apples must be in house 1 (because house 1 has the lilies), the violinist must be in house 2.

So, the violinist lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the cricketer lives.

1. The tennis player lives in the 3rd house.
2. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the 5th house.

4. There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
5. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
6. The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

Now, let's fill in the houses based on these clues:

- Tennis player (3rd house)
- Grilled cheese (5th house)
- Golfer (4th house)
- Stew (1st house) because it's directly left of spaghetti
- Spaghetti (3rd house) because it's one house to the right of stew
- Pizza (2nd house) because it's to the left of the cricketer
- Soccer player (1st house) because it's to the left of the tennis player

So, the cricketer must live in the 2nd house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person wearing running shoes lives in the second house (house 2).
2. The person who likes white lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.
4. The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes white lives in house 1 and the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.
From clue 3, the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other, so the baseball player must be in house 1.
From clue 4, the person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other, so the person who only drinks water must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water, Person who likes white
- House 2: Person who ate spaghetti, Person who likes red, Person who plays baseball, Person who wears loafers

Therefore, the person who wears loafers lives in house 2.

   - The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating mangos.
   - The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
   - The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.

Now, let's figure out where the root beer lover might be:

- The root beer lover can't be in house 2 (clue 3).
- The person who only drinks water can't be in house 2 (clue 2).

So, the root beer lover can only be in house 1 or house 3.

Let's consider house 1:
- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the person who only drinks water must be in house 3 (since they can't be in house 2).
- The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 3).
- The person eating oranges must be in house 2 (since the person eating oranges can't be in house 2, and the only remaining house is 2).

This doesn't work because the person eating oranges can't be in house 2.

Now, let's consider house 3:
- If the root beer lover is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 1 (since they can't be in house 2).
- The coffee drinker must be in house 2 (since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos, and the person eating mangos must be in house 1).
- The person eating oranges must be in house 1 (since the person eating oranges can't be in house 2, and the only remaining house is 1).

This works because:
- The root beer lover is in house 3.
- The person who only drinks water is in house 1.
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating mangos is in house 1 (since the person eating oranges is in house 1, and the only remaining fruit is mangos).

So, the root beer lover lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house. So, the first house is for spaghetti.
2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house. So, the loafers can be in either the second or third house.
3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house. So, the fried rice person can only be in the first or third house.
4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. This means if the fried rice person is in the second house, the boots person must be in the first house. But we know the fried rice person can't be in the second house, so the fried rice person must be in the first house. This makes the boots person in the second house.

So, we have:
- House 1: Spaghetti eater
- House 2: Boots wearer
- House 3: Fried rice eater

Since the loafers can't be in the first house and the second house is taken by the boots wearer, the loafers must be in the third house.

So, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

1. The dog owner lives in house 3.
2. The root beer lover lives in house 5.
3. The person wearing sandals does not live in house 2.
4. The coffee drinker and the person with a rose bouquet live next to each other.
5. The person with running shoes and the bird keeper live next to each other.
6. There is one house between the person with the bouquet of daffodils and the person with the bouquet of lilies.
7. There is one house between the person who owns horses and the person with the bouquet of lilies.
8. The person with carnations arrangement lives next to the bird keeper.
9. The bird keeper lives next to the person who wears loafers.
10. The person with the vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.
11. There are two houses between the person who only drinks water and the person who wears boots.
12. The person who only drinks water lives next to the person who likes milk.

Now, let's use these clues to figure out the house numbers:

- House 3: Dog owner
- House 5: Root beer lover
- House 2: Not sandals (so it could be coffee drinker, rose bouquet, or running shoes/bird keeper)
- House 1: Water drinker and milk drinker (next to each other, and water drinker is not in house 5)
- House 4: Horses
- House 1: Water drinker and milk drinker (since water drinker and milk drinker are next to each other and water drinker is not in house 5, they must be in houses 1 and 2)
- House 2: Running shoes and bird keeper (since running shoes and bird keeper are next to each other and house 2 is not sandals, it must be running shoes and bird keeper)
- House 1: Water drinker and milk drinker (since water drinker and milk drinker are next to each other and water drinker is not in house 5, they must be in houses 1 and 2)
- House 4: Horses
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 5: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes and bird keeper
- House 1: Water drinker and milk drinker
- House 4: Horses
- House 3: Dog owner
- House 5: Root beer lover

So, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 4.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.
   - So, the first house has a mystery book reader.
   
2. The tennis player doesn't live in the first house.
   - This means the tennis player must live in the second house.
   
3. Since the first house has a mystery book reader, the second house must have the fantasy book enthusiast because there are only two kinds of books and two sports.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
2. The person who likes white cannot be in the first house (house 1), and the person who is wearing running shoes cannot be in the fourth house (house 4).

Now, let's look at the options:
- (A) 3
- (B) 4
- (C) 1
- (D) 2

From clue 1, we know the person who likes white must be in one of the last three houses (houses 2, 3, or 4). Since the person who likes white cannot be in house 1, the only options left are houses 2 and 3.

From clue 11, the person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza. This means the person who likes blue cannot be in house 4, and the person who had pizza cannot be in house 1.

From clue 12, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist. This means the person who has a bouquet of lilies cannot be in house 1, and the violinist cannot be in house 4.

From clue 13, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the fourth house (house 4). So, the person who likes white cannot be in house 4.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who only drinks water lives.

1. We know the cellist lives in the first house.

From clue 1, we know the cellist lives in the first house. So, the first house is taken.

From clue 2, the flutist can't be in the fourth house because the person who is wearing boots is to the left of the flutist. So, the flutist can be in the second, third, or fourth house.

From clue 3, the flutist is to the left of the person who likes yellow. So, the person who likes yellow can't be in the first house.

From clue 4, the basketball player can't be in the fourth house because the person who likes red is to the left of the basketball player. So, the basketball player can be in the first, second, or third house.

From clue 5, the flutist is to the right of the cricketer. So, the cricketer can't be in the second, third, or fourth house.

From clue 6, the person who likes yellow is directly left of the person who likes milk. So, the person who likes milk can't be in the first house.

From clue 7, the flutist is to the right of the cricketer. So, the cricketer can't be in the second, third, or fourth house.

From clue 8, the person who likes blue is to the right of the root beer lover. So, the root beer lover can't be in the first house.

From clue 9, the person who likes blue is to the right of the root beer lover. So, the root beer lover can't be in the first house.

From clue 10, the person who only drinks water is to the left of the coffee drinker. So, the person who only drinks water can't be in the fourth house.

Now, let's put it all together:
- The first house is taken by the cellist.
- The flutist can't be in the fourth house, so let's assume the flutist is in the second house.
- The cricketer can't be in the second, third, or fourth house, so the cricketer must be in the first house.
- The basketball player can't be in the fourth house, so let's assume the basketball player is in the third house.
- The person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house because the person who likes milk must be in the third house.
- The person who only drinks water must be in the first house because the coffee drinker must be in the fourth house.

So, the person who only drinks water lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's go through the clues step by step to figure out where the person who likes red lives.

1. The person who likes red lives in the first house.

From clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other. Since the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 1, the person who likes white must live in house number 2.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer. Since the person who has a computer lives in house number 3, the person who had pizza must live in house number 1 or 2. But we already know the person who had pizza lives in house number 1.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives. Since the person who has a computer lives in house number 3, the person who has a radio must live in house number 2.

From clue 5, the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples. Since the person who is eating apples lives in house number 2, the soccer player must live in house number 3.

So, the only house where the person who likes red lives is house number 1.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. The person eating kiwis lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper and the person wearing high heels live next to each other.
3. The tennis player and the person eating apples live next to each other.
4. The person who likes science fiction books lives in the second house.
5. The dog owner doesn't live in the first house.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Eating kiwis
- House 2: Eating apples

From clue 4, we know:
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

From clue 5, we know:
- House 1: Not dog owner

So, the dog owner must be in House 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- House 1: Bird keeper or high heels
- House 2: High heels or bird keeper

Since the person in House 1 is not the dog owner, the bird keeper must be in House 1 and the person wearing high heels must be in House 2.

From clue 3, we know:
- House 1: Tennis player or eating apples
- House 2: Tennis player or eating apples

Since the person in House 1 is the bird keeper and the person in House 2 is the dog owner, the tennis player must be in House 1 and the person eating apples must be in House 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Bird keeper, eating kiwis
- House 2: Dog owner, eating apples

The remaining characteristics are:
- The person in House 1 is the bird keeper and eating kiwis.
- The person in House 2 is the dog owner and eating apples.
- The tennis player and the person eating apples live next to each other in House 1, so the tennis player must be in House 1.
- The person in House 2 is the dog owner and eating apples.
- The person in House 1 is the bird keeper and eating kiwis.
- The person in House 2 is the dog owner and eating apples.
- The person in House 1 is the tennis player and the person in House 2 is the cricketer.

Therefore, the cricketer must live in House 2.

The number of the house where the cricketer lives is **2**."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
2. The grilled cheese and pizza people live next to each other.
3. The cat lover and fish enthusiast live next to each other.
4. Fried rice is not in the first house.
5. The basketball player is to the right of the tennis player.
6. The cricketer is to the left of the tennis player.
7. There are two houses between the spaghetti person and the bird keeper.
8. The cricketer is to the right of the swimmer.
9. Oranges are to the right of mangos.
10. Oranges are in the second house.
11. The bird keeper is to the right of the person eating apples.
12. The swimmer is in the second house.
13. Pizza is in the fifth house.
14. There is one house between the dog owner and the person eating kiwis.

Let's start filling in the houses:

- House 1: Fried rice (because it can't be in the first house)
- House 2: Oranges (given)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Cricketer (because the cricketer is to the left of the tennis player)
- House 5: Pizza (given)

Now, we need to place the grilled cheese and pizza next to each other. They can't be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. So they must be in houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4.

- If grilled cheese is in house 2, pizza must be in house 3.
- If grilled cheese is in house 3, pizza must be in house 4.

Let's try house 2 for grilled cheese and house 3 for pizza:

- House 1: Fried rice
- House 2: Grilled cheese
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Pizza

Now, the cat lover and fish enthusiast must be next to each other. They can't be in houses 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. So they must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

- If cat lover is in house 1, fish enthusiast must be in house 2.
- If cat lover is in house 2, fish enthusiast must be in house 3.

Let's try cat lover in house 1 and fish enthusiast in house 2:

- House 1: Fried rice
- House 2: Cat lover
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Pizza

Now, the person eating oranges is in house 2, and the person eating apples must be to the left of the bird keeper. The person eating kiwis must be to the left of the dog owner.

- House 1: Fried rice
- House 2: Oranges (cat lover)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Pizza

The person eating kiwis must be in house 1 or 2. Since house 2 is occupied by the cat lover, kiwis must be in house 1.

- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges (cat lover)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Pizza

The person eating apples must be to the left of the bird keeper. The person eating kiwis is in house 1, so the person eating apples must be in house 3.

- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges (cat lover)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (apples)
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Pizza

The person eating oranges is in house 2, and the person eating apples is in house 3. The person eating kiwis is in house 1. The person eating mangos must be to the right of the person eating apples, so mangos must be in house 4.

- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges (cat lover)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (apples)
- House 4: Mangos
- House 5: Pizza

The person eating kiwis is in house 1, and the person eating oranges is in house 2. The person eating apples is in house 3, and the person eating mangos is in house 4. The person eating grilled cheese must be in house 4.

- House 1: Kiwis
- House 2: Oranges (cat lover)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (apples)
- House 4: Grilled cheese (mangos)
- House 5: Pizza

The person eating grilled cheese is in house 4, and the person eating pizza is in house 5. The person eating grilled cheese is in house 4, and the person eating pizza is in house 5. The person eating grilled cheese is in house 4, and the person eating pizza is in house 5.

So, the person eating grapes must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the person who is eating grapes lives is 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have 4 houses, and we need to figure out which house the person who had pizza lives in. Here are the clues:

1. The person who likes green lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives next to the person who likes blue.
3. The person who likes red lives next to the person who has carnations.
4. The person who ate fried rice lives in the fourth house.
5. The person who drives a truck doesn't live in the third house.
6. The person who ate mangos lives next to the person who likes red.
7. The person who drives a truck lives next to the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
8. The person who ate spaghetti lives next to the person who drives a minivan.
9. The person who ate mangos lives next to the person who had pizza.
10. The person who likes red lives next to the person who eats grapes.
11. The person who had pizza and the person who has a rose bouquet live next to each other.
12. The person who likes blue and the person who owns an SUV live next to each other.
13. The person who had pizza and the person who eats apples live next to each other.

From clue 1, we know the first house has someone who likes green.

From clue 2, the person who had pizza is next to the person who likes blue. So, if we put blue in house 2, pizza must be in house 1 or 3.

From clue 4, fried rice is in house 4.

From clue 5, the truck can't be in house 3.

From clue 6, mangos are next to red. So, if red is in house 3, mangos must be in house 2 or 4. But house 4 is for fried rice, so mangos must be in house 2.

From clue 7, the truck is next to the lilies. Since mangos are in house 2, the truck can't be in house 2. So, the truck must be in house 1, and the lilies in house 3.

From clue 8, spaghetti is next to the minivan. Since the truck is in house 1, the minivan must be in house 2 (where mangos are), and spaghetti must be in house 3.

From clue 9, mangos (house 2) are next to pizza (house 1). So, pizza must be in house 1.

From clue 10, red is next to grapes. Since red is in house 3, grapes must be in house 4.

From clue 11, pizza and the rose bouquet are next to each other. Since pizza is in house 1, the rose bouquet must be in house 2.

From clue 12, blue and the SUV are next to each other. Since blue is in house 2, the SUV must be in house 3.

From clue 13, pizza and apples are next to each other. Since pizza is in house 1, apples must be in house 2.

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. The person eating grapes doesn't live in the first house.
2. The baseball player lives in the second house.
3. The person driving a convertible also lives in the second house.

From Clue 2, we know the baseball player lives in the second house. And from Clue 3, the person driving a convertible also lives in the second house. So, the person eating grapes must be the baseball player, and they live in the second house.

That means the person eating grapes (the baseball player) is in the second house. The only other person left is the one eating mangos, and they must be in the first house.

So, the person eating mangos lives in the first house.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person who likes blue lives in the second house. So, the person who likes blue is in house 2.
2. The person who likes blue is to the left of the person who eats kiwis. So, the person who eats kiwis must be in house 1.
3. The person who eats apples is next to the person who eats oranges. Since the person who eats kiwis is in house 1, the person who eats apples must be in house 1 and the person who eats oranges must be in house 3.
4. The person who likes white must be to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes white must be in house 3.

So, the person who likes white lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have two houses, house 1 and house 2.
2. The person who has a gameboy lives in house 1.
3. The mystery book reader lives in house 2.
4. The root beer lover lives in house 2, because the root beer lover is to the right of the person with the rose bouquet.
5. The soccer player lives in house 1, because the soccer player is directly left of the mystery book reader.

So, the person with the rose bouquet must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who has a rose bouquet lives is 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's break it down step by step to find out where the dog owner lives.

1. We know the fish enthusiast and the dog owner are next to each other.
2. The truck is two houses away from the dog owner.
3. The truck is next to the sedan.
4. The cat lover is not in the second house.

Let's try to place the houses from 1 to 4:

- If the dog owner is in house 3, the fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since they are next to each other).
- The truck must be in house 1 (since it's two houses away from the dog owner).
- The sedan must be in house 4 (since it's next to the truck).
- The cat lover must be in house 2 (but we already have the fish enthusiast in house 2, so this doesn't work).

So, let's try the dog owner in house 4:

- The fish enthusiast must be in house 3 (since they are next to each other).
- The truck must be in house 2 (since it's two houses away from the dog owner).
- The sedan must be in house 1 (since it's next to the truck).
- The cat lover must be in house 3 (but we already have the fish enthusiast in house 3, so this doesn't work).

Now, let's try the dog owner in house 2:

- The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (since they are next to each other).
- The truck must be in house 4 (since it's two houses away from the dog owner).
- The sedan must be in house 3 (since it's next to the truck).
- The cat lover must be in house 1 (but we already have the fish enthusiast in house 1, so this doesn't work).

Finally, let's try the dog owner in house 3:

- The fish enthusiast must be in house 2 (since they are next to each other).
- The truck must be in house 1 (since it's two houses away from the dog owner).
- The sedan must be in house 4 (since it's next to the truck).
- The cat lover must be in house 1 (but we already have the fish enthusiast in house 1, so this doesn't work).

So, the only place that works is if the dog owner is in house 3.

The dog owner lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler clues:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the third house is yellow. So, the third house is yellow.

From clue 3, the second house is root beer. So, the second house is root beer.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Only drinks water (let's call this person ""W"")
- House 2: Likes root beer (let's call this person ""R"")
- House 3: Likes yellow (let's call this person ""Y"")
- House 4: Likes blue (let's call this person ""B"")

From clue 1, the person who likes blue (B) must be in a house number greater than 3. Since the third house is yellow, the fourth house must be blue.

So, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know the following about them:

1. One person is wearing boots, one is wearing sandals, and one is wearing loafers.
2. One person has a cat, one has a dog, and one has a bird.
3. One person likes green, one likes blue, and one likes white.
4. One person eats oranges, one eats grapes, and one eats mangos.
5. One person plays basketball, one plays baseball, and one plays cricket.

We also have some clues:

1. The cricket player lives somewhere to the right of the person who eats oranges.
2. The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
3. The person who eats grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
4. The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.
5. The person who wears sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
6. The person who likes blue lives in the second house.
7. The person who wears loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who eats grapes.

Let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives.

### Clue 6
- The person who likes blue lives in the second house (house 2).

### Clue 1
- The cricket player lives somewhere to the right of the person who eats oranges.

### Clue 2
- The baseball player lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.

### Clue 3
- The person who eats grapes lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.

### Clue 4
- The dog owner lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.

### Clue 5
- The person who wears sandals lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

### Clue 7
- The person who wears loafers lives somewhere to the right of the person who eats grapes.

Now, let's use these clues to figure out the arrangement:

1. House 2: Person who likes blue.
2. House 1: Dog owner (since the dog owner must be to the left of the person who likes green).
3. House 3: Cricket player (since the cricket player must be to the right of the person who eats oranges).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricket player

Now, we need to place the other people:
- The baseball player must be in House 1 (since the dog owner is in House 1).
- The person who eats grapes must be in House 3 (since the cricket player is in House 3).
- The person who eats oranges must be in House 1 (since the baseball player is in House 1).
- The person who wears sandals must be in House 3 (since the cricket player is in House 3).
- The person who wears loafers must be in House 3 (since the cricket player is in House 3).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Dog owner, Baseball player
- House 2: Person who likes blue
- House 3: Cricket player, Person who eats grapes, Person who wears sandals, Person who wears loafers

The person who likes white must be the bird keeper, and since the bird keeper cannot be in House 1 (as House 1 is taken by the dog owner and baseball player), the bird keeper must be in House 3.

So, the bird keeper lives in House 3.

The answer is (B) 3."

18. The guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
19. The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
20. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.

"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:
1. One person plays the guitar, and the other plays the cello.
2. One person has a computer, and the other has a gameboy.
3. One person has a dog, and the other has fish.

We also know:
1. The cello player lives next to the person with the gameboy.
2. The dog owner doesn't live in the first house.

Now, let's think about where the dog owner could live:
- If the dog owner lived in the first house, then the cello player and the gameboy owner would have to live next to each other in the second house. But that would mean the cello player is next to the gameboy owner, and the dog owner is in the first house, which is okay. But we also know the dog owner can't be in the first house, so that's not possible.
- So, the dog owner must be in the second house.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The person with a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - So, house 3: Gameboy

2. The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - So, house 1: Minivan

3. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the phone and SUV must be next to each other, with the phone to the left of the SUV.

4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the phone and the SUV must be next to each other and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, and the phone is in house 2 (because house 1 is the minivan and house 3 is the gameboy), the SUV must be in house 4.

So, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

The answer is (A) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step like I'm explaining it to a primary school student.

We have 5 houses, and each house has a different person with a different flower and a different device. We need to figure out which house has the person with carnations.

Here are the clues again:
1. The person with lilies is to the right of the person with a phone.
2. The person with a phone is next to the person with a TV.
3. Tulips are in the third house.
4. Daffodils are next to the radio, but not in the fourth house.
5. Computer is in the second house.
6. Rose is next to carnations.

Let's fill in the houses one by one:

1. Tulips are in the third house.
   - House 3: Tulips

2. Computer is in the second house.
   - House 2: Computer

3. Daffodils are next to the radio, but not in the fourth house.
   - Daffodils and radio must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 4 and 5. But since house 2 has a computer, the only place for daffodils and radio is houses 1 and 5.

   - House 1: Phone
   - House 5: Daffodils

4. The person with lilies is to the right of the person with a phone.
   - Phone is in house 1, so lilies must be in house 5.
   - House 5: Daffodils
   - House 1: Phone
   - House 2: Computer

5. The person with a phone is next to the person with a TV.
   - Phone is in house 1, so TV must be in house 2.
   - House 2: Computer
   - House 1: Phone
   - House 3: Tulips

6. The person with carnations is next to the person with roses.
   - The only place left for carnations and roses is house 4.
   - House 4: Carnations

2. The cricketer lives in the second house.
3. The golfer lives in the fourth house.
4. The baseball player lives in the fifth house.
5. The person with running shoes does not live in the fourth house, so they must live in the fifth house.
6. The person with sandals lives between the bird keeper and the person with running shoes. Since the bird keeper is in the first house and the running shoes are in the fifth house, the sandals must be in the third house.
7. The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer, so the cat lover must be in the fourth or fifth house. But since the fifth house is taken by the baseball player, the cat lover must be in the fourth house.
8. The dog owner must be in the remaining house, which is the third house.

So, the dog owner lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's think through this step by step:

1. We have two houses, house 1 and house 2.
2. The root beer lover can't be in house 1, so they must be in house 2.
3. The person eating grapes must be next to the person with the computer, so the computer must be in house 1 and the grapes in house 2.
4. The person with the radio must be next to the person who had pizza, and the person with the radio must be to the left of the person who had pizza.
5. Since the person with the radio and the person who had pizza must be next to each other and the radio person must be to the left, the person with the radio must be in house 1 and the person who had pizza must be in house 1.

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person who likes green lives.

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
   - So, House 1 is the tea drinker.

2. The pizza eater lives in the second house directly next to the tea drinker.
   - So, House 2 is the pizza eater.

3. The spaghetti eater lives in the third house directly next to the water drinker.
   - So, House 3 is the spaghetti eater.

4. The grilled cheese eater lives in the fourth house directly next to the pizza eater.

Now we know:
- House 1: Tea drinker
- House 2: Pizza eater

- House 4: Grilled cheese eater

The only house left for the person who likes green is House 3.

So, the person who likes green lives in House 3.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step again to find out where the person who likes red lives.

1. The person who likes yellow doesn't live in the fourth house.
2. The dog owner lives in the third house.
3. There is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.
4. The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.

6. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
7. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
8. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.
9. The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
10. The person who likes white lives in the third house.
11. The fish enthusiast lives in the first house.

From clue 10, we know the person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since the dog owner lives in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house.

From clue 11, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers. Since the person who is wearing loafers can't live in the first house (clue 7), they must live in the second house. So, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

From clue 9, the root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker. This means the root beer lover and the coffee drinker must be in adjacent houses, with the root beer lover to the left of the coffee drinker.

From clue 8, the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. This means the person who is wearing sandals must live in the third house, and the person who drives a minivan must live in the second house.

From clue 12, the person who likes white lives in the third house. This is consistent with clue 10.

From clue 5, there are two houses between where the person who likes milk lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives. The person who owns a sedan must live in the first house (clue 13), so the person who likes milk must live in the third house (clue 9).

From clue 4, the dog owner lives in the third house. This is consistent with clue 2 and clue 10.

From clue 1, the person who likes yellow doesn't live in the fourth house. Since the person who likes white lives in the third house, the person who likes yellow must live in the first house.

From clue 3, there is one house between where the person who likes red lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house, so the person who likes red must live in the second house.

So, the person who likes red lives in the second house.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

1. We know the person with the bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who eats grapes.
2. The person who eats grapes lives directly left of the person who wears loafers.
3. The person who wears loafers lives in house number 4.
4. So, the person who eats grapes lives in house number 3.
5. The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 2.

So, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 2.

The correct answer is (D) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. The people play different sports, eat different foods, and have different flowers in their houses.
2. The person who plays golf lives next to the person who plays basketball.
3. The person who has lilies lives next to the person who eats grilled cheese.
4. The person who plays soccer lives in the third house.
5. The person who eats grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who eats spaghetti.
6. The person who has tulips doesn't live in the third house.

Now, let's figure out where each person lives:

- Since the person who plays soccer lives in the third house, we know the third house is for the soccer player.
- The person who eats grilled cheese must be next to the person who has lilies, and the grilled cheese person must be to the left of the spaghetti person.
- The golfer and the basketball player must be in the first two houses, and they must be next to each other.

So, if we put the soccer player in house 3, the golfer and the basketball player must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the grilled cheese person must be to the left of the spaghetti person, and the grilled cheese person must be next to the lilies person, the only way this fits is if the lilies person is in house 1 and the grilled cheese person is in house 2.

Therefore, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who ate fried rice also lives in the third house (Clue 9 and Clue 7 are contradictory, so we take Clue 9 as it's the one that fits better with the other clues).

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. The tea drinker lives in house 3.
2. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
3. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
4. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
6. The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

From clue 7, we know the grilled cheese eater is not in house 1. So, the grilled cheese eater must be in house 2, 3, or 4.

From clue 1, the tea drinker is in house 3. So, the grilled cheese eater can't be in house 3. That leaves house 2 or house 4.

From clue 5, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in a house with a lower number than the person who had stew. The person who had stew can't be in house 1 (clue 7), so the person who had stew must be in house 2 or house 4.

If the person who had stew is in house 2, then the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1. But house 1 is already taken by the grilled cheese eater. So, the person who had stew must be in house 4, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1.

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the computer lives.

From clue 1, we know the cricketer lives in the third house. From clue 2, the person who is wearing loafers also lives in the third house. From clue 5, the person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. From clue 10, the person who is wearing high heels lives in the fifth house. From clue 11, the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house. From clue 12, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. From clue 13, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

- Tenth house: person who is wearing running shoes
- Eleventh house: person who is wearing boots
- Twelfth house: person who is wearing running shoes

From clue 8, the soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other. Since the cricketer, loafers, and radio are in the third house, the person with the computer must be in the second house, and the soccer player must be in the fourth house.

So, the person with the computer lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

We have two houses, and one person lives in each. We know:
- One person ate pizza and the other ate fried rice.
- One person likes science fiction books and the other likes history books.
- The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction books.

If the person who ate fried rice is in house 2, then the person who likes science fiction books must be in house 1. This is because the fried rice person is to the right of the science fiction book person.

So, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.

The answer is (B) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and each house has one person living in it. We know some things about the people:

1. One person owns a dog, and the other owns horses.
2. One person likes blue, and the other likes white.
3. One person drinks root beer, and the other only drinks water.
4. One person plays the violin, and the other plays the piano.

We also have some clues:
1. The piano player lives in the first house.
2. The root beer drinker lives next to the person who owns horses.
3. The person who likes white doesn't live in the second house.

From the first clue, we know the piano player lives in house 1. So, house 1 has the piano player and the person who likes white.

From the third clue, the person who likes white can't be in house 2, so they must be in house 1. This means the person who likes white is in house 1, and the person who owns horses is also in house 1.

From the second clue, the root beer drinker must be in house 2 because they live next to the person who owns horses (who is in house 1).

So, the person who owns the dog must be in house 1 because house 1 has the person who likes white and the person who owns horses.

Therefore, the dog owner lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the percussionist lives.

1. The pizza eater lives in house 4.
2. The stew eater lives in house 2.
3. The guitarist and violinist are in houses 1 and 3, but not in that order.
4. The history book buff is to the right of the percussionist.
5. There are two houses between the fried rice eater and the fantasy book enthusiast.
6. The science fiction book fanatic is to the right of the percussionist.
7. The pizza eater is in house 4.

So, we know:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater

This leaves houses 1, 3, and 5 for the guitarist, violinist, history book buff, science fiction book fanatic, and fried rice eater.

Since the science fiction book fanatic is to the right of the percussionist, and the history book buff is also to the right of the percussionist, the percussionist can't be in house 4. Also, the science fiction book fanatic and history book buff can't be in house 1 because the history book buff is to the right of the percussionist.

So, the percussionist must be in house 3. This means the science fiction book fanatic is in house 4, but we already know the pizza eater is in house 4. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1, and the history book buff must be in house 5.

This leaves house 3 for the percussionist.

So, the percussionist lives in house 3.

The answer is: **(B) 3**"
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns horses lives.

1. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
   - So, the first house has someone who likes white.

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - So, the second house is not for the person wearing boots.

3. The bird keeper does not live in the third house.
   - So, the third house is not for the bird keeper.

4. The person who likes white and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the first and second houses have these two people.

5. The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - This means the person who likes green is in the first house, and the person who is wearing running shoes is in the second house.

6. The dog owner lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - This means the dog owner is in the third house.

7. The person who owns horses and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - This means the third and second houses have these two people.

8. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the first and second houses have these two people.

From clue 4, we know the first house has someone who likes white and the second house has someone who has daffodils. From clue 5, the first house has someone who likes green and the second house has someone who is wearing running shoes. From clue 7, the third house has someone who owns horses and the second house has someone who has daffodils. From clue 6, the dog owner is in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:

3. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
4. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house, so the coffee drinker must live in the first house.
5. This leaves the third house for the person who likes milk.

So, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person wearing boots lives.

1. We know the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2.
2. The person who likes red and the person who wears loafers live next to each other. Since the person who likes red must be in house 2 (because the science fiction book fanatic is in house 2), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who wears loafers must be in house 1.
3. The person who likes white lives next to the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who likes red is in house 2, the person who likes white must be in house 1 (because house 1 already has the person who likes red).
4. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.
5. The person who wears boots does not live in house 3.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
7. The person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who wears boots.

From the above clues, we can deduce:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Since the person who likes red is in house 2 and the person who likes white is in house 1, the person who wears boots must be in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
4. The person who likes milk lives in the third house.

So, we know:
- House 1: Person who only drinks water
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of lilies
- House 3: Person who likes milk

Since the person who has a vase of tulips must be to the right of the person who has a bouquet of lilies, and the bouquet of lilies is in the second house, the vase of tulips must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the first house.

The number of the house where the person who has a rose bouquet lives is 1.

So, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's go through the clues step by step to figure out where the cricketer lives.

1. The person wearing boots doesn't live in the second house.
2. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.

9. The person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house.
10. The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
11. The swimmer lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green.

From clue 9, we know the person who is wearing loafers lives in the first house. So, the first house is:
- Person who likes green, person who is wearing loafers, person who has a radio.

From clue 5, the person who likes yellow lives in the third house. So, the third house is:
- Person who likes yellow, person who has a gameboy.

From clue 8, the tennis player lives in the third house. So, the third house is:
- Person who likes blue, person who has a gameboy.

Since the person who likes blue lives in the third house, the person who has a gameboy must live next to the person who likes blue. So, the person who has a gameboy lives in the fourth house.

From clue 10, the person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio. Since the person who has a phone lives in the second or fourth house, and the fourth house is taken by the person who has a gameboy, the person who has a phone must live in the second house. So, the second house is:
- Person who likes blue, person who has a phone.

From clue 1, the person who is wearing boots doesn't live in the second house, so the person who is wearing boots must live in the first or fourth house. But the first house is taken by the person who likes green, so the person who is wearing boots must live in the fourth house.

From clue 6, the person who has a phone doesn't live in the second house, and we already know the second house is taken by the person who likes blue. So, the person who has a phone must live in the first house, but we already know the first house is taken by the person who likes green.

From clue 7, the person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a phone. Since the person who has a phone lives in the first house, the person who has a gameboy must live in the fourth house.

From clue 4, the cricketer lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals. Since the person who is wearing sandals must live in the fourth house, the cricketer must live in the third house.

So, the cricketer lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and we need to figure out where the person who likes yellow lives. Here are the clues again:

1. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
4. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in the first house. So, the first house is yellow.

Now, let's look at clue 2. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Yellow
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: History book buff

From clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in the first house. Since the first house is yellow, the person who had pizza must be in the third house. But the third house is for the history book buff, so the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

This leaves the first house for the person who likes yellow.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the computer lives.

1. The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television.
2. The golfer does not live in the second house.
3. The person who has a computer and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
4. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
5. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a television.

First, let's place the tennis player and the television. They can't be in the same house, and the tennis player must be to the left of the television. So, the possible pairs are:
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 3
- Tennis player in house 2, television in house 3

Next, the golfer can't be in house 2. So, the golfer must be in house 1 or house 3.

Let's try the first pair:
- Tennis player in house 1, television in house 2
- This means the golfer must be in house 3.

Now, we have:
- Tennis player (T) in house 1
- Golfer (G) in house 3

This leaves house 2 for the computer and house 3 for the radio and rose bouquet. Since the computer and tulips must be in adjacent houses (Clue 3), and the radio and rose bouquet must be in adjacent houses (Clue 4 and Clue 5), we need to place the computer and tulips in house 2 and the radio and rose bouquet in house 3.

So, we have:
- House 1: Tennis player (T)
- House 2: Computer (C) and Tulips (Tul)
- House 3: Radio (R) and Rose bouquet (Rb)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
1. Tennis player (T) is to the left of the television (V) in house 1 and house 2.
2. Golfer (G) is in house 3.
3. Computer (C) and tulips (Tul) are in adjacent houses (house 2).
4. Radio (R) and rose bouquet (Rb) are in adjacent houses (house 3).
5. Radio (R) is to the right of the television (V) in house 3.

Therefore, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."

1. The swimmer lives in the third house.
2. The violinist lives in the second house.
3. The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the fifth house.
5. The person who is wearing running shoes lives next to the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.

8. The person who is wearing high heels lives next to the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
9. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives next to the guitarist.
10. The baseball player and the basketball player live next to each other.
11. There are two houses between where the person who is wearing sandals lives and where the cellist lives.

From the clues, we know:
- House 3: Swimmer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 4: Cricketer
- House 5: Bouquet of daffodils

Since the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 5, the person who is wearing running shoes must live in house 4 (next to the daffodils person).

Now, we need to place the other people:
- House 1: Sandals (next to the tulips person)
- House 6: Cellist (two houses away from sandals person)
- House 3: Swimmer (already taken)
- House 2: Violinist (already taken)
- House 5: Bouquet of daffodils (already taken)
- House 4: Cricketer (already taken)
- House 1: Sandals (next to the tulips person)
- House 6: Cellist (two houses away from sandals person)

So, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1.

The answer is (E) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. One person in house 1 has a dog, and the other person in house 2 has fish.
2. One person in house 1 had stew for lunch, and the other person in house 2 had grilled cheese.
3. One person in house 1 is wearing high heels, and the other person in house 2 is wearing sandals.

We also know:
- The person in high heels lives next to the person with fish.
- The person who had grilled cheese lives in house 2.

So, if the person in house 2 had grilled cheese, the person in house 1 must have fish (since the person with fish can't be in house 2).

Since the person in house 2 is wearing high heels and had grilled cheese, the person in house 1 must be wearing sandals and have fish.

This means the person who had stew must be in house 1.

So, the person who had stew lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. We know the phone is in the third house.
2. The flutist is also in the third house.
3. The person eating oranges and the person eating grapes are next to each other.
4. The person eating oranges is to the right of the person wearing boots.

11. The history book buff is to the left of the person eating oranges.
12. The person eating kiwis is not in the first house.
13. The science fiction book fanatic and the person wearing running shoes are next to each other.

From these clues, we can figure out the following:

- The person wearing boots is to the left of the saxophonist.

- The history book buff is to the left of the person eating oranges.
- The person eating kiwis is not in the first house.

So, if we put it all together:

- The first house has the history book buff.
- The second house has the science fiction book fanatic.
- The fourth house has the percussionist.
- The person eating oranges must be in the fourth house because the person eating grapes and the person eating oranges are next to each other, and the person eating oranges is to the right of the person wearing boots.

Therefore, the person eating oranges lives in house 4. The answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the person who eats apples lives.

1. We know the person who had pizza lives in house 2 and eats oranges.
2. The person who likes yellow lives in house 3 and eats mangos.
3. The person who likes white lives in a house to the right of the person who had stew.
4. The person who had stew lives in a house to the left of the person who only drinks water.

From clue 9, the person who only drinks water must live in house 2. But house 2 is already taken by the person who had pizza. So, the person who only drinks water must live in house 3.

From clue 10, the person who likes white must live in house 4.

From clue 7, the person who eats oranges must live in house 1, and the person who eats apples must live in house 4.

So, the person who eats apples lives in house 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person who had pizza lives in.

We have 4 houses and 4 people with different characteristics. Here's the information we know:

1. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
4. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots.
5. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff.

7. The person who drives a convertible lives in the first house.
8. The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
9. The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.

Let's use these clues to figure out the arrangement:

- From clue 7, the person who drives a convertible lives in the first house. So, House 1 is the convertible.
- From clue 6, the person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the history book buff. So, House 2 is the SUV.
- From clue 8, the person who is a fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice. So, House 3 is the fantasy book enthusiast.
- From clue 5, the person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the history book buff. So, House 4 is the grilled cheese.
- From clue 2, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the mystery book reader. So, House 2 is the truck.
- From clue 3, the person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. So, House 1 is the running shoes.
- From clue 4, the person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing boots. So, House 4 is the sandals.
- From clue 1, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic. So, House 1 is the stew.
- From clue 9, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots. So, House 1 is the boots.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Boots, Running shoes, Stew, Convertible
- House 2: Truck, SUV, Mystery book reader, History book buff
- House 3: Fantasy book enthusiast, High heels, Fried rice, Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Grilled cheese, Pizza, Fried rice, History book buff

The person who had pizza lives in House 4.

So, the answer is (A) 4."
"Let's solve this step by step, keeping it simple for someone with primary school education.

1. We have 5 houses, and each house has a person living in it. Each person likes a different kind of book and plays a different musical instrument.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the 4th house.
3. The saxophonist lives in the 4th house.
4. The saxophonist and the violinist live next to each other, so the violinist must be in the 3rd house.
5. The percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover.
6. There is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives.
7. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast.

Now, let's figure out the positions:

- The saxophonist is in the 4th house.
- The violinist is in the 3rd house (next to the saxophonist).
- The history book buff and the guitarist are one house apart.
- The percussionist is directly left of the romance book lover.

Let's place the people:

- 4th house: Saxophonist
- 3rd house: Violinist
- 2nd house: Romance book lover
- 5th house: Fantasy book enthusiast
- 1st house: History book buff

The only house left for the guitarist is the 1st house, and the percussionist must be in the 2nd house.

So, the violinist lives in the 3rd house.

The answer is: **(D) 3**"
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person with the television lives in house 4.
2. The person with loafers lives in house 2.
3. The person with the phone doesn't live in house 2.
4. The person with boots lives somewhere to the left of the person with loafers.
5. There are two houses between where the person with the radio lives and where the person with sandals lives.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 4: Television

From clue 2, we know:
- House 2: Loafers

From clue 3, we know:
- House 2: Loafers (already known)
- House 3: Phone (since the phone can't be in house 2)

From clue 4, we know:
- House 1: Boots (since boots must be to the left of loafers)

Now we have:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television

We need to place the radio and sandals. From clue 5, we know:
- There are two houses between where the radio lives and where sandals lives.

Let's try placing the radio and sandals:
- If the radio is in house 1, then sandals must be in house 3 (two houses between house 1 and house 3).
- If the radio is in house 3, then sandals must be in house 1 (two houses between house 3 and house 1).

But house 1 is already taken by boots, so the radio can't be in house 1. Therefore, the radio must be in house 3 and sandals in house 1.

So the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Boots
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Phone
- House 4: Television

The person with the gameboy must be in house 2.

So, the person with the gameboy lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
The person wearing high heels lives in house number 2. So the correct answer is (B) 2.
"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. One person likes history books, and the other likes mystery books.
2. One person is wearing loafers, and the other is wearing high heels.
3. The person wearing loafers doesn't live in the first house.
4. The mystery book reader doesn't live in the second house.

Now, let's use these clues:

- If the person wearing loafers doesn't live in the first house, they must live in the second house.
- If the mystery book reader doesn't live in the second house, they must live in the first house.

So, the person wearing loafers lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person who had pizza lives in.

1. We know the person who had pizza and the person who is wearing sandals live next to each other.
2. The person who is wearing boots lives to the left of the person who had pizza.
3. Let's try different houses for the person who had pizza:

- If the person who had pizza is in house 1, then the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 2. But the person who is wearing boots must be to the left of the person who had pizza, so this doesn't work.
- If the person who had pizza is in house 2, then the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 3. But the person who is wearing boots must be to the left of the person who had pizza, so this doesn't work.
- If the person who had pizza is in house 3, then the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 4. And the person who is wearing boots must be in house 2, which fits all the clues.

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
2. The saxophonist lives in the second house.
3. The rose bouquet is in the first house.
4. The lilies are in the second house.

So, the person eating apples must be in the second house because the mangos are in the first house and the saxophonist is also in the second house. The lilies are in the second house, so the person with the lilies can't be eating apples.

Therefore, the person eating apples must be in the second house.

The number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is (B) 2."
"Based on the clues given, let's try to figure out where the coffee drinker lives step by step:

- Clue 15 tells us the person who has a radio lives in the first house.
- Clue 16 tells us the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in the fourth house, the person who has a television must be in the fifth house.
- Clue 17 tells us the swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in houses 2 and 3.
- Clue 14 tells us the basketball player lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the basketball player and the person who only drinks water must be in houses 2 and 3.
- Clue 13 tells us the person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the root beer lover. This means the person who drives a minivan and the root beer lover must be in houses 2 and 3.

- Clue 8 tells us the person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow. This means the person who likes milk must be in house 5 and the person who likes yellow must be in house 4.
- Clue 6 tells us the person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. This means the person who likes yellow must be in house 4 and the cricketer must be in house 5.

- Clue 9 tells us the person who has a computer does not live in the third house. This means the person who has a computer must be in houses 1, 2, or 5. Since the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, the person who has a computer must be in house 5.

So, the only house left for the coffee drinker is the fourth house.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (E) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. The people have different flowers and different cars. Here are the clues:

1. The person with tulips doesn't live in the third house.
2. The person with an SUV lives next to the person with lilies.
3. The person with a sedan and the person with roses live next to each other.
4. The person with roses doesn't live in the second house.

Now, let's think about it:

- If the person with roses lives in the first house, then the person with a sedan must live in the second house (because they live next to each other). But then the person with lilies can't live in the third house because the person with an SUV must be next to the person with lilies. This means the person with lilies would have to live in the first house, but that's not possible because the person with roses is already there. So, the person with roses can't be in the first house.
- If the person with roses lives in the third house, then the person with a sedan must live in the second house (because they live next to each other). This means the person with lilies must live in the first house (because the person with an SUV must be next to the person with lilies). And the person with tulips must live in the second house (because the person with roses is already in the third house, and the person with tulips can't be in the third house).

So, the person with tulips lives in the second house, the person with roses lives in the third house, the person with a sedan lives in the second house, and the person with lilies lives in the first house.

Therefore, the person who drives a truck lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the 4th house.
   - House 4: Lilies

2. The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the 5th house.
   - House 5: Tulips

3. The science fiction book fanatic does not live in the 2nd house.
   - House 2: Not science fiction book fanatic

4. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - Possible pairs: (3, 4), (4, 5)

5. The violinist does not live in the 4th house.
   - Possible pair: (3, 4)

6. The person who has a rose bouquet and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

7. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

8. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the pianist.
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

9. The percussionist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

10. The violinist lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
    - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

11. The romance book lover does not live in the 3rd house.
    - House 3: Not romance book lover

12. The fantasy book enthusiast and the root beer lover live directly next to each other.
    - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

13. The history book buff lives directly left of the percussionist.
    - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

14. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
    - Possible pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)

From the above clues, we can deduce the following:

- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips
- House 3: Not romance book lover
- House 2: Not science fiction book fanatic
- House 1: Not history book buff, not fantasy book enthusiast, not root beer lover, not cellist, not pianoist, not violinist, not water drinker
- House 2: Not science fiction book fanatic
- House 3: Not romance book lover
- House 4: Lilies
- House 5: Tulips

By process of elimination and the given clues, we can conclude that the person who likes milk lives in the 3rd house.

So, the answer is:
(B) 3"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the basketball player lives.

1. The person who likes yellow lives in the first house.
2. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.
4. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.
5. The soccer player does not live in the fourth house.
6. The person who is eating a banana lives next to the person who likes white.
7. The person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who is eating oranges.
8. The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.
9. The person who drives a convertible lives in the fourth house.
10. The person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other.
11. The person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who likes white.
12. The person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live next to each other.
13. The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
14. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the cricketer lives.

From clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the person who likes yellow and the person who is eating kiwis.

From clue 9, the person who owns an SUV and the person who is eating a banana live next to each other. Since the first house is taken by yellow and kiwis, the person who owns an SUV must be in the third house, and the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

From clue 14, the swimmer and the cricketer must be in houses that are two houses apart. Since the first house is yellow and kiwis, and the second house is bananas, the cricketer must be in the first house (yellow) and the swimmer must be in the third house (SUV).

From clue 13, the person who owns an SUV and the person who likes blue live next to each other. Since the SUV is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

From clue 11, the person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who likes white. Since the fourth house is SUV and blue, the person who likes white must be in the second house (bananas).

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who likes yellow, Person who is eating kiwis.
- Second house: Person who likes white, Person who is eating oranges.
- Third house: Person who owns an SUV, Person who is eating a banana.
- Fourth house: Person who drives a convertible, Person who likes green, Person who is eating kiwis.

The basketball player must be in the remaining house, which is the second house.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in the second house. The answer is (D) 2."
"Let's figure out where the person who likes blue lives step by step.

We know:
1. The person who likes green lives in the third house.
2. The person who likes yellow lives next to the person who likes green.
3. The person who had stew lives next to the person who likes yellow.
4. The person who ate grilled cheese doesn't live in the second house.
5. The person who had stew lives next to the person who likes romance.

From clue 1, the person who likes green lives in the third house. So, the person who likes yellow must be in the second house because they live next to the person who likes green.

From clue 2, the person who had stew lives next to the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes yellow is in the second house, the person who had stew must be in the first house.

From clue 3, the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in the first house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the third house. But we already know the person who likes green is in the third house, so the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the second house, which is a contradiction. This means the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house, and the person who had stew is in the second house.

From clue 4, the person who ate grilled cheese doesn't live in the second house. So, the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the first house.

From clue 5, the person who had stew lives next to the person who likes romance. Since the person who had stew is in the second house, the person who likes romance must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Person who ate grilled cheese
- Second house: Person who had stew, person who likes romance
- Third house: Person who likes green, fantasy book enthusiast

Since the person who likes green is in the third house, the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

Therefore, the person who likes blue lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know some things about what each person has:

1. One person has carnations.
2. One person has tulips.
3. One person has roses.
4. One person plays percussion.
5. One person plays piano.
6. One person plays cello.
7. One person drives a sedan.
8. One person drives a truck.
9. One person drives a convertible.
10. One person keeps birds.
11. One person keeps fish.
12. One person keeps horses.
13. One person likes blue.
14. One person likes yellow.
15. One person likes red.

We also know some clues:

1. The tulip person and the bird keeper live next to each other.
2. There's one house between the percussionist and the truck driver.
3. The sedan driver lives next to the fish keeper.
4. The yellow person lives in the third house.
5. There's one house between the horse keeper and the rose person.
6. The horse keeper and the blue person live next to each other.
7. The carnation person lives in the first house.
8. The cello person doesn't live in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the first house has carnations. So, the first house is taken by the person with carnations.

From clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From clue 1, the tulip person and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper can't be in the first or third house. So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From clue 2, there's one house between the percussionist and the truck driver. This means the percussionist and the truck driver must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From clue 3, the sedan driver lives next to the fish keeper. This means the sedan and the fish keeper must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From clue 5, there's one house between the horse keeper and the rose person. This means the horse keeper and the rose person must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From clue 6, the horse keeper and the blue person live next to each other. This means the horse keeper and the blue person must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From clue 8, the cello person doesn't live in the third house. This means the cello person must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Let's summarize:
- First house: Carnations (person with carnations)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Second house: Tulips and bird keeper
- Fourth house: Rose bouquet and person who likes blue (next to the person who owns horses)
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Second house: Percussionist or cellist
- Third house: Truck (next to the percussionist or cellist)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (house 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (house 1).
3. This creates a problem because only one person can live in each house. So, we need to rethink this.

Since the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist can't both be in the first house, let's say the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house (house 1) and the cellist is in the second house (house 2).

Now, the person who likes green must be in the second house (house 2) because the person who likes red has to be in the first house (house 1).

So, the person who likes red is in house 1 and likes green, and the person who likes green is in house 2 and likes red.

This means the mystery book reader must be in house 2 because the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1 and the cellist is in house 2.

So, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:
1. The golfer lives in the second house.
2. The history book buff lives in the first house.
3. There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

From clue 2, we know the golfer is in the second house. So, it looks like this:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Golfer
- House 3: Unknown

From clue 3, the history book buff is in the first house. So, it's:
- House 1: History book buff
- House 2: Golfer
- House 3: Unknown

Now, clue 1 tells us there is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives. Since the history book buff is in the first house, the science fiction book fanatic can't be in the first or third house. So, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the third house. This means the swimmer must be in the first house.

So, the swimmer lives in the first house.

The number of the house where the swimmer lives is (A) 1."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who had stew lives.

1. The bird keeper lives in house 3.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives in house 1.
3. The soccer player lives in house 2.
4. The fried rice eater lives in house 4.
5. The cat lover lives in house 1 (because the cat lover lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, and the spaghetti eater is in house 1).
6. The person who ate bananas lives in house 1 (because the banana eater lives directly left of the soccer player, and the soccer player is in house 2).
7. The person who ate fried rice does not live in house 4.
8. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1 (because the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the person who owns horses, and the person who owns horses lives in house 4).
9. The science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2 (because the science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who had pizza, and the person who had pizza lives in house 2).
10. The person who had pizza lives in house 2 (because the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 2).
11. The person who had grapes lives in house 1 (because the person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast, and the fantasy book enthusiast is in house 1).
12. The person who had pizza lives in house 2 (already determined).
13. The person who had stew lives in house 3 (because the person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate apples, and the person who ate apples lives in house 4).

So, the person who had stew lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

We have two houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know the following:
- One person ate fried rice, and the other ate spaghetti.
- One person has a cat as a pet, and the other has horses.
- One person likes history books, and the other likes romance books.
- One person is wearing sandals, and the other is wearing running shoes.

We also have two clues:
1. The person wearing sandals lives next to the person who has horses.
2. The person who likes history books lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.

Now, let's try to figure out where each person lives and what they like.

### Possible Lunches:
- Fried Rice
- Spaghetti

### Possible Pets:
- Cat
- Horses

### Possible Books:
- History Book
- Romance Book

### Possible Shoes:
- Sandals
- Running Shoes

Let's start with the first clue:
- The person wearing sandals lives next to the person who has horses.

### Possible Arrangements:
1. If Person 1 (House 1) has horses and Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals:
   - Person 1 (House 1) ate spaghetti (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the history book buff (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the cat lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the romance book lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing running shoes (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing sandals (Clue 1).

2. If Person 2 (House 2) has horses and Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals:
   - Person 2 (House 2) ate spaghetti (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the history book buff (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is the cat lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is the romance book lover (Clue 2).
   - Person 2 (House 2) is wearing running shoes (Clue 2).
   - Person 1 (House 1) is wearing sandals (Clue 1).

### Checking the Second Clue:
- The person who likes history books lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.

In both scenarios, the person who ate fried rice must be in House 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who ate fried rice lives is **2**.

The correct answer is: (B) 2"
"Let's think through the clues step by step:

1. The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
   - This means the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.
   - The person who owns a sedan lives in house 1.

2. The flutist does not live in the first house.
   - So, the flutist must live in house 2.

From clue 1, we know the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 2. And from clue 2, the flutist also lives in house 2.

So, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step, following the clues given:

1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the fourth house.
2. The rose bouquet is in the third house.
3. The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader.
4. The fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer.
5. The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the third house.
7. The tennis player does not live in the fourth house.
8. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
9. There are two houses between where the mystery book reader lives and where the romance book lover lives.

Now, let's place the people based on these clues:

- House 4: Carnations arrangement.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (because the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer).
- House 1: Mystery book reader (because there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast (because the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

Now, we need to place the tennis player. The tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader, and the tennis player does not live in the fourth house. So, the tennis player must be in house 5.

This leaves house 4 for the person who has a bouquet of daffodils. Now we know:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player.
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast.

The only house left is house 2 for the romance book lover.

So, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Coffee drinker.

2. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the computer and gameboy cannot be in House 3. So, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

3. The saxophonist does not live in the second house.
   - Possible houses for saxophonist: 1, 3, 4, 5.

4. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - Possible houses for daffodils: 1, 3, 4, 5.

5. The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.
   - Possible houses for gameboy: 1, 3, 4, 5.

6. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
   - If the computer is in House 4, the gameboy must be in House 3 (but the coffee drinker is in House 3). So, the computer must be in House 5 and the gameboy in House 4.

7. The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.
   - Computer in House 5, so cellist must be in House 4.

8. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the computer is in House 5, the percussionist must be in House 4 (but cellist is in House 4). So, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3 and the percussionist in House 5.

9. The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.
   - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

10. The person who likes milk lives in the fifth house.
    - House 5: Milk drinker.

11. The person who has a television does not live in the fifth house.
    - Possible houses for television: 1, 2, 3, 4.

12. The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

13. The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

14. The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.
    - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

15. The person who only drinks water and the saxophonist live directly next to each other.
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

16. The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
    - Possible pairs: (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

Now, let's put it all together:

- Coffee drinker in House 3.
- Computer in House 5, cellist in House 4, percussionist in House 5.
- Milk drinker in House 5.
- Television in House 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Saxophonist in House 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Water drinker in House 1, 2, 3, 4.

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know some things about what each person is wearing, what they ate, what kind of car they have, what sport they play, and what flowers are in their foyer.

1. The person wearing boots lives next to the person who drives a minivan.
2. The person who had pizza lives next to the person with a rose bouquet.
3. The person wearing running shoes doesn't live in the first house.
4. The cricketer lives next to the person with a vase of tulips.
5. The person who had pizza doesn't live in the second house.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives next to the person with a sedan.
7. The person who drives a minivan lives in the third house.
8. The golfer lives in the first house.
9. The person with a rose bouquet doesn't live in the second house.

Now, let's figure out where each person lives:

- From clue 7, the person who drives a minivan lives in house 3.
- From clue 8, the golfer lives in house 1.
- From clue 5, the person who had pizza doesn't live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or 3. But since the golfer is in house 1, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.
- From clue 4, the cricketer lives next to the person with a vase of tulips. So if the person with tulips is in house 2, the cricketer is in house 1. But we already know the golfer is in house 1, so the cricketer must be in house 2.
- From clue 3, the person wearing running shoes doesn't live in house 1, so they must live in house 2 or 3. But since the person with pizza is in house 3, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 2.
- From clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese lives next to the person with a sedan. So if the person with sedan is in house 1, the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 2. But we already know the person wearing running shoes is in house 2, so the person with sedan must be in house 3.
- From clue 2, the person who had pizza (in house 3) must be next to the person with a rose bouquet. So the person with a rose bouquet must be in house 1.

So, the person with a rose bouquet lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

2. The flutist lives in the second house.
3. The cellist and the person who ate spaghetti live next to each other.
4. The person who had pizza lives next to the person who ate fried rice.
5. The person who had stew and the person who only drinks water live next to each other.
6. The person who ate fried rice lives next to the person who had pizza.

13. The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
14. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.

Let's place the saxophonist in the third house:
- House 3: Saxophonist

Now, the flutist must be in the second house:
- House 2: Flutist

The cellist and the person who ate spaghetti must be next to each other. They can't be in the first or fifth house:
- House 1: Cellist
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti

The person who had pizza and the person who ate fried rice must be next to each other:
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 5: Person who had pizza

- House 1: Cellist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 5: Person who had pizza

The person who likes red must be somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker:

The coffee drinker must live next to the percussionist:
- House 5: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 3: Saxophonist
- House 2: Flutist
- House 1: Cellist

The person who ate fried rice lives next to the person who had pizza:
- House 4: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 5: Person who had pizza

So, the percussionist must be in the fourth house.

The percussionist lives in the fourth house. The answer is (C) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person who likes white lives in.

1. We know Fried Rice lives in house 3.
2. We also know that the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, or 2 and 4.
3. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who had stew does not live in the second house or the fourth house.
5. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes white.
7. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes yellow lives.

Let's use these clues to figure it out:

- If the person who had stew lives in house 1, then the person who likes red lives in house 2. But that would mean the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow must be in houses 2 and 4, which is not possible because the person who had stew cannot be in house 2.
- If the person who had stew lives in house 2, then the person who likes red lives in house 1. But that would mean the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow must be in houses 1 and 5, which is not possible because the person who had stew cannot be in house 2.
- If the person who had stew lives in house 4, then the person who likes red lives in house 3. But that would mean the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow must be in houses 2 and 5, which is not possible because the person who had stew cannot be in house 4.
- If the person who had stew lives in house 5, then the person who likes red lives in house 4. This means the person who likes white and the person who likes yellow must be in houses 1 and 2, which is possible.

So, the person who likes white lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and we need to figure out where the basketball player lives. Here are the clues:

1. The violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
2. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
3. The basketball player lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player.
4. The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.
5. The percussionist lives in the second house.

From clue 5, we know the percussionist lives in house 2. So, house 2 is taken by the percussionist.

From clue 2, the person who likes red lives in house 3. So, house 3 is taken by the person who likes red.

From clue 4, the person who likes yellow does not live in house 2. Since house 2 is taken by the percussionist, the person who likes yellow must live in house 1.

Now, we know:
- House 1: Person who likes yellow
- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: Person who likes red

This leaves house 4 for the violinist. From clue 1, the violinist lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the violinist is in house 4, the basketball player must be in house 1.

So, the basketball player lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person with carnations arrangement lives in.

1. We know the person with carnations arrangement doesn't live in house 3.
2. The root beer lover and coffee drinker live next to each other.
3. The cellist lives to the right of the person with a vase of tulips.
4. There's one house between the phone and the TV.
5. The person with daffodils lives to the left of the cellist.
6. The percussionist lives to the right of the person with a gameboy.
7. The root beer lover lives to the left of the percussionist.
8. The root beer lover lives to the left of the person with a bouquet of lilies.
9. There's one house between the person with daffodils and the coffee drinker.
10. The tea drinker lives to the left of the pianist.

Let's try to fit these clues together:

- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 2 (because they live next to each other).
- The person with carnations arrangement can't be in house 3, so it must be in house 1 or 2.
- If the root beer lover is in house 1, the person with carnations arrangement can't be in house 1, so it must be in house 2.
- The cellist must be in house 4 or 5, and the person with a vase of tulips must be in house 3 or 1.
- The person with daffodils must be in house 1 or 2, but since the root beer lover is in house 1, the daffodils can't be in house 1.
- The percussionist must be in house 4 or 5, and the person with a gameboy must be in house 3 or 2.
- The person with a bouquet of lilies must be in house 3 or 4.
- The person with a phone must be in house 3 or 4.
- The person with a tea drinker must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person with a piano must be in house 1 or 2.

By fitting all these clues together, we find that the person with carnations arrangement lives in house 2.

So, the answer is (B) 2."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

1. The dog owner lives in the second house.
2. The fish enthusiast lives in the third house.
3. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the fifth house.
5. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
6. The person who has a gameboy does not live in the second house.
7. The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
8. The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
9. There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the person who drives a convertible lives.
10. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.
11. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.
12. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
13. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
14. The person who has a computer does not live in the fifth house.
15. The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.
16. The person who has a carnations arrangement does not live in the fifth house.
17. There is one house between where the person who has a television lives and where the person who owns an SUV lives.

Let's place the dog owner in the second house:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: ?
- House 5: ?

The fish enthusiast lives in the third house, so:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: ?
- House 5: ?

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck, and there are two houses between the truck and the convertible. So, the truck must be in House 4 and the convertible in House 6 (but since we only have 5 houses, the convertible must be in House 5):
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1, and the person who drives a truck must be in House 4:
- House 1: Bouquet of daffodils
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The gameboy must be to the left of the radio, so the gameboy is in House 1 and the radio is in House 2:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Fish enthusiast
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The bouquet of lilies cannot be in House 5, so it must be in House 3:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Truck
- House 5: Convertible

The vase of tulips must be to the left of the person who owns horses, and the person who has a vase of tulips and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other. The convertible is in House 5, so the vase of tulips must be in House 4:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Dog owner
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Vase of tulips
- House 5: Convertible

The person who has a computer must be in House 2, and the person who has a gameboy must be in House 1:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Bouquet of lilies
- House 4: Vase of tulips
- House 5: Convertible

The person who has a television must be in House 3, and the person who owns an SUV must be in House 5:
- House 1: Gameboy
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Vase of tulips
- House 5: SUV

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in House 4.

The answer is (B) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:

1. One person has a fish as a pet.
2. One person has a dog as a pet.
3. One person has a cat as a pet.
4. One person had spaghetti for lunch.
5. One person had stew for lunch.
6. One person had pizza for lunch.
7. One person plays basketball.
8. One person plays cricket.
9. One person plays tennis.
10. One person plays the saxophone.
11. One person plays the guitar.
12. One person plays the violin.
13. One person drinks tea.
14. One person drinks milk.
15. One person only drinks water.
16. There is one house between where the cat lover lives and where the guitarist lives.
17. The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer.
18. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the fish enthusiast lives.
19. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner.
20. The basketball player lives in the first house.
21. The saxophonist lives in the first house.
22. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.

Now, let's figure out where each person lives:

- The basketball player lives in the first house.
- The saxophonist also lives in the first house.
- So, the first house is occupied by the basketball player and the saxophonist.

Since the basketball player and the saxophonist are in the first house, the second and third houses must have the remaining people.

- The tea drinker lives directly left of the cricketer, so they must be in the second and third houses.
- The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the fish enthusiast, so they must be in the second house and the fish enthusiast in the third house.
- The person who had pizza lives directly left of the dog owner, so they must be in the second house and the dog owner in the third house.
- The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk, so the person who had stew must be in the second house and the person who likes milk in the third house.

So, the houses are:
- House 1: Basketball player (saxophonist)
- House 2: Cat lover (tea drinker, pizza eater)
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (cricketer, dog owner)

The dog owner lives in house 3.

So, the correct answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. The person in house 1 likes history books and wears loafers.
2. The person in house 2 likes cats and has a computer.
3. The person in house 2 also likes daffodils.
4. The person in house 1 likes daffodils.
5. The person in house 1 likes lilies.
6. The person in house 2 likes lilies.

From clue 1, we know the person in house 1 likes daffodils and wears loafers. So, the person in house 2 likes lilies.

So, the person with a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who has carnations lives in house 1.
2. The person who has apples lives directly left of the person who has fried rice.
3. The person who has mangos does not live in house 5.
4. The person who has mangos does not live in house 4.
5. The person who has grilled cheese lives next to the person who has stew.
6. The person who has daffodils lives directly left of the person who has roses.
7. There are two houses between where the person who has bananas lives and where the pianist lives.
8. The person who has tulips does not live in house 3.
9. The pianist does not live in house 5.
10. The person who has pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist.
11. The person who has pizza does not live in house 5.
12. The person who has pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who has grilled cheese.

Let's start filling in the houses:

- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Apples (since it must be to the left of the daffodils)
- House 3: Not daffodils (since it must be to the right of apples)
- House 4: Not daffodils (since it must be to the right of apples)
- House 5: Not daffodils (since it must be to the right of apples)

Now, we know:
- House 2: Apples
- House 1: Carnations

Since the person who has apples lives directly left of the person who has fried rice, the person who has fried rice must be in house 3.

- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 2: Apples

The person who has daffodils lives directly left of the person who has roses, so the person who has roses must be in house 4.

- House 4: Roses
- House 3: Fried Rice

The person who has grilled cheese lives next to the person who has stew, so the person who has stew must be in house 5.

- House 5: Stew
- House 4: Roses
- House 3: Fried Rice

The person who has pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist, and the person who has pizza does not live in house 5. So, the person who has pizza must be in house 4 or 5. But house 5 is already taken by stew, so the person who has pizza must be in house 4.

- House 4: Pizza
- House 3: Fried Rice
- House 2: Apples
- House 1: Carnations
- House 5: Stew

So, the person who had pizza lives in house 4.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the cellist lives.

After all these steps, we find that the cellist must live in the third house.

So, the number of the house where the cellist lives is **3**.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the pianist lives.

1. The pianist and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
2. The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between where the person eating grapes lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person eating kiwis lives.

We have three houses numbered 1, 2, and 3. Let's try to place the people and fruits based on these clues.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
  - Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

- **Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
  - If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
  - If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

- **Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
  - If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.
  - If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

- **Clue 2:** The flutist lives to the right of the violinist.
  - If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
  - If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

Now, let's try to fit everything together:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

The only way to fit all the clues is if:
- The person eating kiwis is in house 2.
- The violinist is in house 1.
- The flutist is in house 3.
- The person eating grapes is in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

So, the only correct configuration is:
- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, the pianist must be in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know the person eating kiwis lives in house 1.
2. The person eating oranges must live in house 2 because there is only one person in each house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in house 1, so they must live in house 2.

So, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We have two houses, one numbered 1 and the other 2.
2. The root beer lover can't be in house 2 because of clue 1.
3. The pianist and the cellist must be in adjacent houses, and the pianist must be to the left of the cellist.

So, if the root beer lover is in house 1 (because they can't be in house 2), then the pianist and the cellist must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the pianist must be to the left of the cellist, the pianist must be in house 1 and the cellist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the root beer lover lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the person with the bouquet of lilies lives.

1. The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
2. The person with sandals is not in the fifth house, so they must be in one of the other houses.
3. The person with tulips is to the right of the person with daffodils and is also next to the person with loafers.
4. The person with running shoes is one house away from the person with lilies.
5. The person with boots and the person with carnations are next to each other.
6. The person with sandals is not in the fourth house.
7. The person with tulips is not in the fourth house.
8. The person with tulips is next to the person with loafers.

Let's place the people based on these clues:

- The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with boots and the person with carnations are next to each other, so the fourth house is not for boots.
- The person with sandals is not in the fifth house, so they must be in the first house.
- The person with sandals is in the first house.
- The person with boots is in the fourth house.
- The person with tulips is next to the person with loafers and is to the right of the person with daffodils.
- The person with running shoes is one house away from the person with lilies.

Now, let's place the remaining people:

- The person with sandals is in the first house.
- The person with boots is in the fourth house.
- The person with carnations is in the fifth house.
- The person with tulips is in the third house (since it's to the right of the person with daffodils and next to the person with loafers).
- The person with daffodils is in the second house (since it's next to the person with running shoes and the person with tulips is in the third house).
- The person with running shoes is in the second house (since it's next to the person with daffodils and one house away from the person with lilies).
- The person with lilies is in the fourth house (since it's one house away from the person with running shoes).

So, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house.

The answer is (D) 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the pianist lives in.

1. We know the baseball player lives in house 2.
2. The white person and the water drinker are next to each other, so they can't be in house 1 or 4.
3. The swimmer and the white person are next to each other, so they can't be in house 1 or 4.
4. The blue person and the oranges person are not next to each other, so they can't be in house 1 or 4.
5. The percussionist and the green person are not next to each other, so they can't be in house 1 or 4.
6. The saxophonist is next to the tennis player, so they can't be in house 1 or 4.
7. The blue person is next to the tea drinker, so they can't be in house 1 or 4.
8. The grapes person and the tennis player are not next to each other, so they can't be in house 1 or 4.
9. The white person and the tea drinker are next to each other, so they can't be in house 1 or 4.
10. The coffee drinker is next to the pianist, so they can't be in house 1 or 4.

Now, let's look at the houses:
- House 1: Blue
- House 2: White (baseball player)
- House 3: Green (percuist)
- House 4: Oranges (saxophonist)

So, the pianist must be in house 3 because it's the only house left that fits all the clues.

The pianist lives in house 3.

The answer is (B) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know the following:

1. One person likes white, one likes green, and one likes red.
2. One person ate spaghetti, one ate fried rice, and one ate stew.
3. One person is wearing boots, one is wearing running shoes, and one is wearing high heels.
4. The person who likes white lives in the first house.
5. The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house.
6. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
7. The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
8. The person who had stew does not live in the second house.

From clue 2, we know the first house is occupied by someone who likes white. From clue 4, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. From clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. From clue 7, the person who had stew does not live in the second house, so the person who had stew must live in the first or third house. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house, the person who had stew must live in the first house (since the person who had stew cannot live in the second house).

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew. Since the person who had stew lives in the first house, the person who likes white must live in the first house. Therefore, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew.

Now, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green. The person who ate spaghetti cannot live in the second house (Clue 3), so the person who ate spaghetti must live in the first or third house. Since the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the person who ate spaghetti must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

From clue 5, the person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who is wearing boots must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing high heels must live in the first house. This contradicts clue 2, which states that the person who likes white lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who likes white must live in the second house, and the person who is wearing boots must live in the first house. This means the person who is wearing high heels must live in the third house.

So, the first house is occupied by someone who likes white and someone who had stew, the second house is occupied by someone who likes green and someone who is wearing boots, and the third house is occupied by someone who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house, the person who ate fried rice must live in the first or second house. From clue 3, the person who ate spaghetti does not live in the second house, so the person who ate fried rice must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who ate fried rice lives in the first house.

The correct answer is (C) 1."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the rose bouquet is in house number 2.
2. The science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3 because they live next to the rose bouquet person and the fantasy book enthusiast is to the left of them.
3. The romance book lover is in house number 4 because they live next to the tulip person and the carnation person is in house number 1.
4. This leaves house number 1 for the person with the carnations.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Tulips

The only house left for the lilies is house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and we know:
- The science fiction book lover lives in the first house (house 1).
- The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing sandals.
- The sandals wearer can't be in the first house, so they must be in the second house.
- The coffee drinker can't be in the first house, so they must be in the second house.
- That leaves the water drinker and the romance book lover to be in the first house.

So, the romance book lover must be in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

We have two houses, and we know:
- House 1 has a person.
- House 2 has a person.
- One person plays the piano, and the other plays percussion.
- One person has a radio, and the other has a phone.

We also know that the percussionist lives next to the person with the radio. So, if the percussionist is in House 1, the person with the radio must be in House 2. This is because the percussionist has to be next to the radio person.

So, we have:
- House 1: Percussionist
- House 2: Piano player

Now, we need to decide who has the radio and who has the phone. Since the piano player is in House 2, the person with the radio must be in House 1. That means the person with the phone must be in House 2.

So, the person with the phone lives in House 2.

The correct answer is:
(B) 2"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives in the second house.
   - So, the second house is for the person who drives a convertible.

2. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who owns a sedan lives.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them.

3. The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - This means the person who likes yellow must be in the house next to the person who owns a sedan.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The second house is for the person who drives a convertible.
- The person who likes white and the person who owns a sedan must be in houses 1 and 3, with one house in between them. So, they could be in houses 1 and 3, but not in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
- The person who likes yellow must be in the house next to the person who owns a sedan.

If the person who owns a sedan is in house 1, then the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.
If the person who owns a sedan is in house 3, then the person who likes yellow must be in house 2.

So, the person who likes yellow lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the person who owns horses lives.

1. The person wearing running shoes lives in the first house. So, the first house has running shoes.
2. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house. So, the third house has a sedan.
3. The dog owner doesn't live in the third house. So, the third house can't be a dog owner.
4. The person wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper. This means sandals are in a house before the bird keeper.
5. There are two houses between where the person wearing running shoes lives and where the bird keeper lives. Since the running shoes are in the first house, the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.
6. The person wearing high heels doesn't live in the fourth house. So, the fourth house can't be high heels.
7. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns an SUV. This means the SUV is to the left of the fish enthusiast.
8. The fish enthusiast doesn't live in the third house. So, the third house can't be the fish enthusiast.
9. The person wearing high heels lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. This means high heels and truck are next to each other.
10. The person wearing loafers doesn't live in the fifth house. So, the fifth house can't be loafers.
11. The fish enthusiast doesn't live in the fifth house. So, the fifth house can't be fish enthusiast.
12. The dog owner doesn't live in the first house. So, the first house can't be a dog owner.
13. The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan. This means the minivan is to the left of the horses.

Now, let's put it all together:
- House 1: Running shoes (loafers)
- House 2: Sandals (high heels)
- House 3: Sedan (high heels)
- House 4: Bird keeper (loafers)
- House 5: Minivan (loafers)

The person who owns horses must be in the fifth house because the minivan is to the left of the horses.

So, the person who owns horses lives in the fifth house. The answer is (E) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out which house the person who drives a truck lives in.

1. We know the convertible is in the first house.
2. The person who is wearing loafers is in the second house.
3. The bird keeper is in the first house.
4. The grapes eater and the fish enthusiast are next to each other, and the fish enthusiast is in the fifth house.
5. The sandals wearer is next to the truck driver, and the truck driver is in the fifth house.
6. The sedan owner is next to the SUV owner, and the sedan owner is in the third house.
7. The dog owner is two houses away from the person who eats oranges, and the oranges eater is in the fourth house.
8. The person who has a bouquet of lilies is somewhere to the left of the cat lover, and the cat lover is in the fifth house.
9. The person who has a rose bouquet is next to the person who has a vase of tulips, and the tulip person is in the third house.
10. The person who has a vase of tulips is next to the person who wears boots, and the boots wearer is in the fourth house.

So, let's fill in the houses:

- House 1: Bird Keeper
- House 2: Loafers
- House 3: Sedan Owner
- House 4: Oranges Eater
- House 5: Fish Enthusiast (and also the cat lover)

Since the sedan owner is in the third house and the truck driver is in the fifth house, the person who drives a truck must be in the fifth house.

So, the person who drives a truck lives in House 5.

The answer is (C) 5."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and we know the following:
1. The person who ate spaghetti lives to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
2. The person who ate fried rice lives to the right of the person who likes science fiction books.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes fantasy books lives in the second house.

From clue 3, we know the fried rice person lives in the second house. So, it looks like this:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Fried Rice
- House 3: ?

From clue 4, the fantasy book person lives in the second house. So, it looks like this:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Person
- House 3: ?

From clue 2, the fried rice person (in the second house) lives to the right of the science fiction book person. So, the science fiction book person must be in the first house:
- House 1: Science Fiction Book Person
- House 2: Fried Rice, Fantasy Book Person
- House 3: ?

Now, the only person left is the grilled cheese eater. Since the grilled cheese eater can't be in the first house (because the science fiction book person is there) and can't be in the third house (because the grilled cheese eater can't be to the right of the fried rice eater), the grilled cheese eater must be in the third house.

So, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

We have two houses, house 1 and house 2. In house 1, there's a person with carnations, and in house 2, there's a person with a dog. The clue tells us that the person with carnations is to the left of the person with a dog. Since house 1 is to the left of house 2, the person with the carnations must be in house 1.

So, the number of the house where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives is **1**.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person eating kiwis lives in house 2. So, house 2 has kiwis.
2. The person wearing sandals lives directly left of the person liking yellow. This means the person liking yellow must be in house 1 and the person wearing sandals must be in house 2.
3. The person drinking water lives directly left of the person wearing high heels. Since the person wearing sandals is in house 2, the person drinking water must be in house 1. So, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2.

So, the person wearing high heels lives in house 2.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. The person wearing high heels lives to the left of the person wearing sandals.
2. The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals live next to each other.
3. The tea drinker lives to the left of the person with the television.

From these clues, we can figure out the following:

- The person wearing sandals must be in house 1 because the person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (since they can't be next to each other in house 1).
- The person eating grapes and the person wearing sandals are next to each other, so the person eating grapes must be in house 1 too.
- The tea drinker must be in house 1 because they live to the left of the person with the television, and the person with the television must be in house 2.

So, the person eating kiwis must be in house 2.

The number of the house where the person who is eating kiwis lives is **2**."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the tea drinker lives in house 1.
2. The cellist can't live in house 3 because the person who only drinks water must be to the right of the cellist.
3. The violinist can't live in house 3 because there must be one house between the violinist and the guitarist.
4. The guitarist can't live in house 3 because the violinist can't be there.

So, if the cellist is in house 2 (because the cellist can't be in house 3), the guitarist must be in house 3.

Therefore, the guitarist lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

- The fourth house is for the person who only drinks water.
- The fifth house is for the tea drinker.
- The first house is not for the person who is wearing running shoes.
- The second house is not for the coffee drinker or the person who is wearing loafers.

- If the radio is in house 3, the computer must be in house 4 (but house 4 is taken by pizza).
- If the radio is in house 5, the computer must be in house 4 (but house 4 is taken by pizza).

So, the radio must be in house 1 and the computer in house 2.

Now we have:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Computer
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Radio (already placed)

Next, the gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house. The only place left for the gameboy is house 3, and the fried rice must be in house 4 (but house 4 is taken by pizza).

So, we have:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Radio (already placed)

Now, the grilled cheese and spaghetti must be next to each other. The only place left for them is house 3 and house 4, but house 4 is taken by pizza. So, the grilled cheese must be in house 3 and the spaghetti in house 4.

So, we have:
- House 1: Radio
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Radio (already placed)

This leaves the phone and the television. The phone must be to the right of the television. The only place left for the phone is house 5, and the television must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Television
- House 2: Computer
- House 3: Grilled cheese
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Phone

"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

We have two houses, and we know some things about the people living in them:

1. One person plays a percussion instrument, and the other plays a guitar.
2. One person had pizza for lunch, and the other had grilled cheese.
3. One person has a dog as a pet, and the other has a bird.

We also know two clues:
1. The person who had grilled cheese lives to the right of the person who has a bird as a pet.
2. The percussionist doesn't live in the second house.

Now, let's figure it out:

- From clue 1, the person who had grilled cheese must be in the second house because the bird must be in the first house. This is because the grilled cheese person can't be in the first house (because the bird is there) and the bird can't be in the second house (because the grilled cheese person is there).
- So, the percussionist can't be in the second house (clue 2), so the percussionist must be in the first house.
- This means the guitarist must be in the second house because the guitarist can't be in the first house (where the percussionist is) and the pizza eater can't be in the second house (where the grilled cheese person is).

So, the person who had pizza lives in the second house.

The answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. The bird keeper lives in house number 3.
2. The other clues help us figure out the rest, but we don't need to go into all that detail.

So, the bird keeper lives in house number 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3.
2. Each person has a different pet, instrument, fruit, shoes, and book.
3. We know the cat lover lives in house 1.
4. We need to figure out where the science fiction book fanatic lives.

Let's list the clues again:
1. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
6. The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
7. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
8. The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. The cat lover lives in the first house.

Since the cat lover lives in house 1, we can start by placing the cat lover in house 1.

Now, let's place the other clues:
- The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.
- The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
- The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the pianist.
- The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

Let's try to place the people step by step:

1. House 1: Cat lover (cat owner)
2. House 2: (Pianist, percussionist, flutist, fantasy book enthusiast, fish enthusiast, running shoes, oranges, loafers)
3. House 3: (Pianist, percussionist, flutist, fantasy book enthusiast, fish enthusiast, running shoes, oranges, loafers)

Since the cat lover is in house 1, we need to place the other people in houses 2 and 3.

From clue 5, the fish enthusiast must be in house 2 or 3, and the person eating a banana must be in house 1 or 3. Since the cat lover is in house 1, the fish enthusiast must be in house 2 or 3, and the person eating a banana must be in house 3.

From clue 6, the flutist must be in house 3, and the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

From clue 7, the person eating oranges must be in house 3, and the pianist must be in house 2.

From clue 8, the person wearing running shoes must be in house 1, and the fish enthusiast must be in house 2.

From clue 9, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 1, and the flutist must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Cat lover (cat owner)
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast (fantasy book fan), Pianist, Person eating a banana, Person wearing running shoes
- House 3: Fish enthusiast (fish lover), Flutist, Person eating oranges

Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 3.

The answer is: (C) 3"
"Let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person eating kiwis lives.

1. We know the person eating grapes is in house 2.
2. The person who likes red and the person who likes green live next to each other. Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1 and the person who likes red must be in house 3.
3. The person who likes white lives between the person who likes red and the person who likes a banana. So, the person who likes white must be in house 1 and the person who likes a banana must be in house 3.
4. The person who likes green is to the left of the person who likes yellow. Since the person who likes green is in house 1, the person who likes yellow must be in house 4.
5. The person who likes red is to the right of the person who likes kiwis. So, the person who likes kiwis must be in house 4.

So, the person eating kiwis lives in house 4. The answer is (A) 4."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who had stew lives.

1. The person wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges.
2. The mystery book reader lives next to the cat lover.
3. The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live next to each other.

From clue 1, we know:
- The person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person wearing running shoes is in house 2.

From clue 2, we know:
- The mystery book reader and the cat lover are next to each other.

From clue 3, we know:
- The mystery book reader and the person who had stew are next to each other.

Now, let's place the people:
- House 1: Person eating oranges
- House 2: Person wearing running shoes

Since the mystery book reader and the person who had stew must be next to each other, and the mystery book reader is next to the cat lover, we can place them as follows:
- House 1: Person eating oranges
- House 2: Person wearing running shoes
- House 3: Mystery book reader and person who had stew

Since the mystery book reader and the person who had stew are next to each other, and the mystery book reader is next to the cat lover, the only place left for the cat lover is house 3.

So, the person who had stew must be in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who had stew lives is 3.

The correct answer is not listed in the options provided, but based on the clues, the person who had stew lives in house 3."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the root beer lover lives in house 1.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in house 2.
3. The person who has a television does not live in house 2, so they must live in house 1 or house 3.
4. The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
5. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.

From clue 1, we know:
- House 1: Root beer lover (bouquet of tulips)
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (bouquet of daffodils)

Now, the person who has a television must be in house 3 because they can't be in house 2. So:
- House 3: Person who has a television

Since the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2. But we already know house 2 is taken by the person who only drinks water. So, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 1, but that's already taken by the root beer lover.

This means the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3, and the person who has a television must be in house 2. So:
- House 1: Root beer lover (bouquet of tulips)
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (bouquet of daffodils)
- House 3: Person who likes root beer (bouquet of tulips)

So, the person who likes root beer lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Let's figure out where the person with the computer lives step by step using the clues given.

1. The person wearing loafers lives in the first house. So, the first house has loafers.
2. The person with a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person eating mangos. This means the phone can be in house 1 or 2, but not in house 3.
3. The person eating grapes lives next to the person drinking water. So, grapes and water must be in houses 1 and 2.
4. The person wearing boots doesn't live in the third house. So, boots can be in houses 1 or 2.
5. The person eating kiwis lives next to the person who likes milk. So, kiwis and milk must be in houses 1 and 2.
6. The person wearing boots lives somewhere to the right of the person with a gameboy. So, boots and gameboy must be in houses 2 and 3.
7. The person eating kiwis doesn't live in the first house. So, kiwis must be in house 2.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Wearing loafers
- House 2: Phone, Boots, Gameboy, Kiwis
- House 3: Mangos, Milk

Since the person with the phone is in house 2, the person with the phone is not the one with the computer. The person with the phone is not the one with the gameboy, so the person with the phone is the one with the computer.

Therefore, the person with the computer lives in **House 2**.

The correct answer is (A) 2."

1. We have three houses: 1, 2, and 3.
2. Each house has a different sport, flower, and pet.
3. The golfer is not in house 3.
4. The fish enthusiast is to the left of the person who owns horses.
5. The golfer and baseball player are next to each other.
6. The carnations and the person who owns horses are next to each other.
7. The carnations are to the left of the baseball player.
8. The rose bouquet and the daffodil bouquet are next to each other.
9. The cricketer is not in house 3.

Let's try to place the people step by step:

- Since the golfer is not in house 3, he can be in house 1 or 2.
- The baseball player must be next to the golfer.
- The fish enthusiast is to the left of the person who owns horses.
- The carnations and the person who owns horses are next to each other.
- The carnations are to the left of the baseball player.

Let's try house 1 for the golfer:
- If golfer is in house 1, baseball player must be in house 2 (since they are next to each other).
- Fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (since they are to the left of the person who owns horses).
- This means the person who owns horses must be in house 2 (since fish is left of horses).
- But house 2 is already taken by the baseball player, so this is not possible.

Now let's try house 2 for the golfer:
- If golfer is in house 2, baseball player must be in house 1 (since they are next to each other).
- Fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (since they are to the left of the person who owns horses).
- This means the person who owns horses must be in house 3 (since fish is left of horses).
- This fits all the conditions.

So, the person who owns horses lives in house 3.

The answer is: (A) 3"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step like I'm explaining to a primary school student.

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know some things about what each person has:

1. One person eats oranges, one eats mangos, and one eats bananas.
2. One person drives a convertible, one drives a truck, and one drives a sedan.
3. One person keeps birds, one owns dogs, and one owns horses.

We also have some clues:

1. The person who eats oranges lives in the first house.

Now, let's use these clues to figure out where each person lives:

- House 1: The person who eats oranges (Clue 1).
- House 3: The person who owns horses (Clue 5).

So, we have:
- House 1: Orange eater.
- House 3: Horse owner.

Now, we need to place the person who eats mangos and the person who drives a convertible. Since they live next to each other (Clue 6), and the horse owner is in house 3, the mangos eater and convertible driver must be in houses 2 and 1. But house 1 is already taken by the orange eater, so the mangos eater must be in house 2 and the convertible driver must be in house 1. This means house 1 is taken by the horse owner, and house 2 is taken by the mangos eater and convertible driver.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Horse owner.
- House 2: Mangos eater and convertible driver.
- House 3: Horse owner.

The only house left is house 2, and we know the person who drives a truck must be next to the person who drives a convertible. Since the convertible driver is in house 2, the truck driver must be in house 1.

So, the person who drives a truck lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."

6. The flutist must be in the fourth house.
7. The person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti is in the fourth house.
8. The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the grilled cheese eater is in the fifth house.
9. The person who ate fried rice must be in the first house (but we already know the first house is for the mystery book reader).

"Let's break down the clues step by step to find out where the saxophonist lives.

1. The radio is in house 3.
2. The percussionist and guitarist are next to each other.
3. The person with a television is next to the person who likes red.
4. There's one house between the guitarist and the person who likes yellow.
5. There are two houses between the percussionist and the violinist.
6. The person with a phone is next to the person with a gameboy.
7. The person who likes green is in house 3.
8. The percussionist is next to the person who likes white.
9. The person who likes red is not in house 2.
10. The person with a computer is next to the person with a phone.
11. The person with a computer is not in house 2.
12. The person with a computer is to the left of the person with a phone.

Let's start with the known information:

- House 3: Green (person who likes green)
- House 3: Radio (person who has a radio)
- House 3: Computer (person who has a computer)
- House 3: Phone (person who has a phone)
- House 3: Gameboy (person who has a gameboy)
- House 3: Television (person who has a television)

Since the percussionist and guitarist are next to each other, and the percussionist is next to the person who likes white, we can place them:

- House 2: Percussionist
- House 3: White (person who likes white)
- House 4: Cellist (since the cellist does not live in house 5 and cannot be in house 1)
- House 5: Violinist (since the violinist lives two houses away from the percussionist)

Now, we need to place the remaining people:

- The person who likes red is not in house 2, so they must be in house 1 or house 4.
- The person who likes yellow is not in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or house 4.
- The person who likes red is next to the person who likes yellow, so they must be in house 1 and house 4.

Since the person who likes red is not in house 2, and the person who likes yellow is not in house 3, the only place left for the person who likes red is house 1, and the person who likes yellow is in house 4.

So, the house where the saxophonist lives is house 1.

The answer is (D) 1."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We have two houses, 1 and 2.
2. The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader. This means the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2.
3. The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover. Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.
4. The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other. Since the cellist and the mystery book reader are already in houses 1 and 2, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2. But we already know the history book buff and the cat lover are in houses 1 and 2. So, the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2 in that order.

So, the root beer lover is in house 1 and the guitarist is in house 2.

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

"Let's think through the clues step by step to figure out where the person with the vase of tulips lives.

1. The person with carnations lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.
3. The person with tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.

- House 1: Dog owner, Bird keeper, or Tulips
- House 2: Dog owner, Bird keeper, or Tulips
- House 3: Dog owner, Bird keeper, or Tulips

From clue 1, the person with carnations must be in a house to the right of the bird keeper. So, if the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 3, there's no house to the right of house 3, so this is not possible.

From clue 2, the dog owner cannot be in house 2. So, the dog owner can only be in house 1 or house 3.

From clue 3, the person with tulips must be in a house to the right of the dog owner. So, if the dog owner is in house 1, the tulips must be in house 3. If the dog owner is in house 3, the tulips must be in house 2.

Now, let's combine all the clues:
- If the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper must be in house 2 (because house 1 is taken by the dog owner), and the carnations must be in house 3 (because the bird keeper is in house 2). The tulips must be in house 3, but house 3 is already taken by the carnations. This is not possible.
- If the dog owner is in house 3, the bird keeper must be in house 1 (because house 3 is taken by the dog owner), and the carnations must be in house 2 (because the bird keeper is in house 1). The tulips must be in house 2, but house 2 is already taken by the carnations. This is not possible either.

The only way to fit all the clues is if the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the tulips are in house 3.

So, the person with the vase of tulips lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The person eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - So, the first house has mangos.

2. The person who owns horses doesn't live in the first house.
   - So, the first house is not horses.

3. The bird keeper and the person eating kiwis live next to each other.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in the first house, the person eating kiwis is in the second house, or if the bird keeper is in the second house, the person eating kiwis is in the first house.

4. The person eating a banana doesn't live in the third house.
   - So, the third house is not bananas.

5. The person who owns horses doesn't live in the second house.
   - So, the second house is not horses.

6. The person eating a banana lives next to the dog owner.
   - This means if the banana eater is in the first house, the dog owner is in the second house, or if the banana eater is in the second house, the dog owner is in the first house.

Now, let's put it all together:

- House 1: Eating mangos, not horses, not bananas, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not bananas, dog owner.
- House 3: Not bananas.
- House 4: Not horses.

Since the person eating a banana can't be in the third house, it must be in the first house. So, the dog owner is in the second house.

This means:
- House 1: Eating mangos, not bananas, not dog owner.
- House 2: Not horses, not bananas, dog owner.
- House 3: Not bananas.
- House 4: Not horses.

Since the person eating a banana is in the first house, the person eating kiwis must be in the third house (because they live next to each other).

So, the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in house 4. The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the mystery book reader lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Mystery book reader

2. The bird keeper and the history book buff live next to each other.
   - So, they can be in houses 2 and 3.

3. The romance book lover can't be in the third house.
   - So, the romance book lover must be in the second house.

4. The person who owns horses can't be in the third house.
   - Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the person who owns horses must be in the first house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who owns horses
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Romance book lover

Therefore, the romance book lover lives in the second house.

The answer is: (B) 2"
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the coffee drinker lives.

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house. (Clue 1)
   - So, the coffee drinker lives in house number 2.

2. The person eating apples lives directly left of the person drinking water. (Clue 2)
   - This means the person eating apples and the person drinking water must be next to each other, with the apple eater to the left of the water drinker.

3. The person eating mangos does not live in the first house. (Clue 3)
   - So, the mangos eater can live in houses 2, 3, or 4.

4. The person eating mangos does not live in the third house. (Clue 4)
   - So, the mangos eater can live in houses 1 or 4.

5. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. (Clue 5)
   - This means the apple eater must be in a house to the left of the tea drinker.

6. The person eating kiwis does not live in the third house. (Clue 6)
   - So, the kiwi eater can live in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Now, let's try to fit these clues together:

- From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives in house 2.
- From Clue 4, the mangos eater cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 4.
- From Clue 6, the kiwi eater cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1, 2, or 4.
- From Clue 2, the apple eater and the water drinker must be next to each other, and the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker.
- From Clue 5, the apple eater must be to the left of the tea drinker.

Let's try placing the people:

- If the mangos eater is in house 1, then the kiwi eater must be in house 4 (since they cannot be in house 3).
- The apple eater and the water drinker must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. But since the apple eater must be to the left of the water drinker, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Mangos eater
  - House 2: Coffee drinker (Clue 1)
  - House 3: Apple eater
  - House 4: Water drinker

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The coffee drinker is in house 2.
- The apple eater is to the left of the water drinker.
- The mangos eater is in house 1.
- The kiwi eater is in house 4.
- The water drinker is in house 4.

So, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is house number 2.

The correct answer is: **(D) 2**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the person eating bananas lives.

1. The person who likes white lives in house 2.
2. The person who likes blue lives in house 4.
3. The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who likes red.
4. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives.
5. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.
6. There is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who is eating apples lives.
7. The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
8. The cricketer does not live in the fifth house.
9. The person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
10. There are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives.
11. The person who likes green lives in the fifth house.
12. The person who is eating a banana lives in the third house.

From clue 7, we know the soccer player lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person eating bananas.

From clue 11, the person who likes green lives in the fifth house. So, the fifth house is occupied by the person who likes green.

From clue 9, the person who is eating kiwis and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the person eating bananas is in the third house, the person eating kiwis must be in the second house.

From clue 10, there are two houses between where the person who is eating oranges lives and where the baseball player lives. Since the person eating kiwis is in the second house, the person eating oranges must be in the first house, and the baseball player must be in the fourth house.

From clue 5, the golfer lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer. Since the cricketer cannot be in the fifth house, and the golfer must be to the left of the cricketer, the golfer must be in the first house, and the cricketer must be in the fourth house.

From clue 2, there is one house between where the person who likes white lives and where the person who likes blue lives. Since the person who likes white is in the second house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

From clue 1, the person who likes white (house 2) lives directly left of the person who likes red (house 4). Since the person who likes blue lives in house 4, the person who likes red must live in house 1.

From clue 3, the person who likes white (house 2) lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player (house 4). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From clue 4, there is one house between where the person who likes white (house 2) lives and where the person who is eating apples (house 4). This is consistent with the arrangement.

From clue 6, the cricketer (house 4) does not live in the fifth house, which is consistent.

From clue 9, the person who is eating kiwis (house 2) and the person who is eating a banana (house 3) live directly next to each other, which is consistent.

So, the person who is eating a banana lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (D) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

We have three houses, and we need to figure out where the person with carnations lives. Here's how we can think about it:

1. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
2. There is one house between where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives and where the golfer lives.
3. The golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
4. The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.
5. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff.
6. The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
7. The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
8. The soccer player lives in the second house.

From clue 8, we know the soccer player lives in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the soccer player.

From clue 5, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the history book buff. This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house. So, the history book buff must be in the third house.

From clue 1, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels. Since the history book buff is in the third house, the person who had stew must be in the third house. So, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first house.

From clue 6, the person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the history book buff is in the third house, the person who has a rose bouquet must be in the first house, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in the second house.

From clue 7, the person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew. Since the person who had stew is in the third house, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in the fourth house.

From clue 3, the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet. Since the person who has a rose bouquet is in the first house, the golfer must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: History book buff
- Second house: Soccer player
- Third house: Person who had stew
- Fourth house: Golfer

The person with carnations must be in the first house because the first house is already occupied by the history book buff.

So, the person with carnations lives in the first house. The answer is:

(A) 1"

3. One person has a gameboy, one has a phone, and one has a TV.
4. One person drives a convertible, one drives a minivan, and one drives a truck.

Here are the clues again:
1. The person with a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a minivan.
2. The person who drives a truck and the person who has a gameboy live directly next to each other.
3. The person who drives a minivan and the cellist live directly next to each other.
4. The person who wears high heels and the person who has a TV live directly next to each other.
5. The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a truck.
6. The flutist lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.
7. The person who wears boots lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.

Now, let's think about it step by step:

- From clue 6, the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. So, if the flutist is in house 1, the minivan must be in house 2.
- From clue 5, the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck must be in house 3.
- From clue 2, the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. So, the gameboy must be in house 3.
- From clue 3, the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. So, the cellist must be in house 2.
- From clue 4, the person with high heels and the person with the TV are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 2, the person with the TV must be in house 1 and the person with high heels must be in house 3.
- From clue 7, the person who wears boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person who wears boots must be in house 3 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

So, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The answer is (C) 1."

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the person with the lilies bouquet lives in the second house.
2. The person with the SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
3. The person with the truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
4. The person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
5. The person with the truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.

From clue 2, we know the person with the SUV lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV.

From clue 5, the person with the lilies bouquet is in the second house.

From clue 3, the person with the truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover. Since the person with the SUV is in the first house, the person with the truck must be in the third house. This means the root beer lover must be in the first house, but we already know the SUV is there. So, the root beer lover must be in the second house, but that's already taken by the person with the lilies bouquet. This means the root beer lover must be in the third house.

From clue 4, the person with the rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker. Since the person with the lilies bouquet is in the second house, the person with the rose bouquet must be in the first house. This leaves the third house for the coffee drinker.

So, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and we need to figure out which house the person who drives a truck lives in. Here are the clues again:

1. The person who likes blue lives next to the person who ate spaghetti.
2. The person who had stew lives next to the person who has lilies.
3. The person who has a rose lives next to the person who drives a truck.
4. The person who had stew lives next to the person who drives a minivan.
5. The person who likes red doesn't live in the first house.
6. The person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who has daffodils.

Now, let's think about it:

- From clue 5, the person who likes red can't be in house 1. So, they must be in house 2 or 3.
- From clue 6, the person who drives a minivan and the person who has daffodils must be next to each other. So, if the minivan person is in house 1, the daffodils person must be in house 2, and if the minivan person is in house 2, the daffodils person must be in house 3.
- From clue 4, the person who had stew is next to the person who drives a minivan. So, if the minivan person is in house 1, the stew person must be in house 2, and if the minivan person is in house 2, the stew person must be in house 3.
- From clue 1, the person who likes blue is next to the person who ate spaghetti. So, if the person who likes blue is in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 3, and if the person who likes blue is in house 2, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 1.
- From clue 3, the person who has a rose is next to the person who drives a truck. So, if the person who has a rose is in house 2, the person who drives a truck must be in house 3.

Putting all these clues together, we can see that the person who drives a truck must be in house 3.

So, the answer is (A) 3."
"Let's break down the clues step by step to figure out where the person who owns a sedan lives.

1. The soccer player lives in the second house.
2. The person who had stew does not live in the fourth house.
3. The person who likes red lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
5. The person who had stew and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
6. The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
7. The flutist lives in the third house.
8. The cellist and the flutist live directly next to each other.
9. The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.
10. The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the fourth house.
11. The person who likes green does not live in the third house.
12. The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.
13. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
14. The person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house.

From clue 6, we know the basketball player lives in the fourth house. From clue 9, the person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house. From clue 12, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, the basketball player, and the person who likes white.

From clue 11, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. From clue 10, the cellist and the flutist live next to each other. From clue 7, the flutist lives in the third house. So, the cellist must live in the second house (since the flutist lives in the third house and they must be next to each other).

Now, we know:
- Second house: Cellist
- Third house: Flutist
- Fourth house: Person who owns an SUV, basketball player, and person who likes white

From clue 1, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. From clue 5, the person who had stew and the person who had pizza live next to each other. From clue 13, the person who likes white lives in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns an SUV, basketball player, and person who likes white.

From clue 4, the person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house. From clue 14, the person who likes green does not live in the third house. From clue 15, the person who owns a sedan does not live in the second house. So, the person who owns a sedan must live in the first house.

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's break it down step by step to figure out where the person with the phone lives.

1. We know the gameboy is in the third house.
2. The person who likes red is in the second house.
3. The person who likes white is in the first house.
4. The person who eats grapes is in the third house.
5. The person who likes red (in the second house) is to the left of the person who eats grapes (in the third house).
6. The person who has a phone is next to the person who wears running shoes.
7. There is one house between where the person who eats apples lives and where the person who wears sandals lives.
8. The person who likes white (in the first house) is to the left of the person who eats grapes (in the third house).

From clue 4, we know the person who eats grapes is in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who eats grapes.

From clue 5, the person who likes red is in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the person who likes red.

From clue 6, the person who likes white is in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes white.

From clue 3, the person who eats apples must be in the first house or the second house. But since the first house is already taken by the person who likes white, the person who eats apples must be in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the person who eats apples.

From clue 3 again, the person who wears sandals must be in the fourth house. So, the fourth house is occupied by the person who wears sandals.

From clue 2, the person who has a phone must be in the first house or the second house. But since the first house is already taken by the person who eats apples, the person who has a phone must be in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the person who has a phone.

From clue 1, the person who wears running shoes must be in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the person who wears running shoes.

From clue 7, the person who wears sandals (in the fourth house) is one house to the right of the person who eats apples (in the second house).

So, the person who has a phone lives in the second house.

The answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the bird keeper lives.

1. We know the bird keeper lives in the second house from the first clue.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the left of the violinist. This means the violinist can't be in the first house.
3. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the guitarist.
4. There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist.
7. The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the guitarist.
8. The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house.
10. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From clue 10, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house 1. So, house 1 is taken by the person who ate grilled cheese.

From clue 9, the person who owns horses lives in house 4. So, house 4 is taken by the person who owns horses.

From clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1, the bird keeper can't be in house 1. So, the bird keeper must be in house 2.

From clue 5, the person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner. This means if the bird keeper is in house 2, the dog owner must be in house 3.

From clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the saxophonist. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in house 1, the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 2 (but that's the bird keeper's house), so the saxophonist must be in house 4 (but that's the person who owns horses).

From clue 7, the person who ate grilled cheese (house 1) must be to the left of the guitarist (house 1), which is a contradiction. So, we need to re-evaluate.

Given the constraints, the only consistent placement is:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who owns horses

So, the bird keeper lives in house number 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

We have two houses, one on the left (house 1) and one on the right (house 2). Each house has one person living in it, and each person has different things they like or do. Here are the clues:

1. The tea drinker and the person who eats grapes live next to each other.
2. The saxophonist and the golfer live next to each other.
3. The baseball player and the person who eats grapes live next to each other.
4. The saxophonist lives in house 1.
5. The romance book lover and the golfer live next to each other.

From clue 4, we know the saxophonist lives in house 1. So, house 1 has the saxophonist.

Now, clue 1 tells us the tea drinker and the person who eats grapes are next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the tea drinker and the person who eats grapes must be in houses 1 and 2.

Clue 3 tells us the baseball player and the person who eats grapes are next to each other. So, the baseball player and the person who eats grapes must be in houses 1 and 2.

Clue 2 tells us the saxophonist and the golfer are next to each other. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2.

So, we have:
- House 1: Saxophonist (saxophonist)
- House 2: Person who eats grapes (baseball player or romance book lover or golfer)

Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the tea drinker and the baseball player.

Now, we know the romance book lover and the golfer are next to each other. Since the golfer is in house 2, the romance book lover must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Tea drinker, Romance book lover, Baseball player
- House 2: Golfer, Person who eats grapes

The person who eats grapes is in house 2, and the person who eats mangos must be in house 2.

So, the number of the house where the person who eats mangos lives is house 2.

The answer is: **(A) 2**"

233. The"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know the following:

1. The person with the lily flowers doesn't live in the second house.
2. The person with high heels doesn't live in the second house.
3. The person with boots lives in the first house.
4. The person with daffodils lives in the first house.

From clue 3, we know the person with boots lives in the first house. And from clue 4, we know the person with daffodils also lives in the first house. So, the first house is taken by both the person with daffodils and the person with boots.

This means the second house can't have the person with daffodils or the person with high heels. So, the second house must have the person with lilies and the person with high heels.

That leaves the third house for the person with roses and the person with running shoes.

So, the person with boots lives in the first house.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 5 houses, numbered 1 to 5.
2. Each house has a person with different characteristics.
3. We need to figure out which house the tea drinker lives in.

Here are the clues again:
1. The coffee drinker does not live in the fourth house.
2. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
3. The basketball player and the tennis player live directly next to each other.
4. The person who ate spaghetti lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
5. The tea drinker lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
6. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
7. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
8. The person who only drinks water does not live in the fifth house.
9. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
10. The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
11. The cricketer lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
12. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water.
13. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the basketball player.
14. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.

Let's try to figure out the order:

- From clue 13, the person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.
- From clue 14, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the tennis player.
- From clue 3, the basketball player and the tennis player are next to each other.
- From clue 4, the person who ate spaghetti and the person who is wearing loafers are next to each other.
- From clue 5, the tea drinker and the person who had pizza are next to each other.
- From clue 6, the soccer player is to the right of the person who had stew.
- From clue 7, the person who had pizza is to the left of the cricketer.
- From clue 8, the person who only drinks water is not in the fifth house.
- From clue 9, the person who only drinks water is to the left of the tea drinker.
- From clue 10, the person who only drinks water is to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
- From clue 11, the cricketer is to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.

Let's try to fit these clues together:

1. Boots (1)
2. Stew (2)
3. Tennis (3)
4. Pizza (4)
5. Cricketer (5)

This fits all the clues:
- The person who is wearing boots lives in the first house.
- The person who had stew lives in the second house.

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have two houses, and each house has a person living in it. We know some things about the people:

1. One person likes red, and the other likes yellow.
2. One person is eating oranges, and the other is eating grapes.
3. One person likes mystery books, and the other likes fantasy books.
4. One person drives a truck, and the other drives a convertible.
5. One person wears boots, and the other wears running shoes.

We also have some clues:
- The person eating grapes lives next to the person who drives a truck.
- The person wearing boots lives next to the person who likes mystery books.
- The person who likes yellow lives next to the person who drives a truck.

From these clues, we can figure out the following:
- The person who likes yellow must be next to the person who drives a truck.
- The person who drives a truck must be next to the person eating grapes.
- The person who likes mystery books must be next to the person wearing boots.

Let's put it together:
- If the person who likes yellow is next to the person who drives a truck, and the person who drives a truck is next to the person eating grapes, then the person who likes yellow must be in House 1 and the person who drives a truck must be in House 2.
- The person who likes mystery books must be next to the person wearing boots, so if the person in House 1 likes yellow, the person in House 1 must be wearing boots, and the person in House 2 must be the mystery book reader.

So, the person who likes fantasy books must be in House 2.

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 2**.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out where the person who ate fried rice lives.

1. We know the person who likes green lives in house 3.
2. The person who drives a minivan lives next to the person who ate fried rice.
3. The person who drives a minivan also lives next to the mystery book reader.
4. The mystery book reader lives between the person who had stew and the person who drives a convertible.
5. The person who had stew lives in house 13.
6. The person who ate fried rice lives next to the person who drives a minivan.

From clue 13, we know the person who had stew lives in house 13. Since the person who ate fried rice lives next to the person who drives a minivan, and the person who drives a minivan lives next to the mystery book reader, we can deduce the following:

- House 12: Yellow book lover
- House 11: Fried rice eater
- House 10: Convertible driver
- House 9: Grilled cheese eater
- House 8: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 7: White book lover
- House 6: Blue book lover
- House 5: Romance book lover
- House 4: Mystery book reader
- House 3: Green book lover
- House 2: Minivan driver
- House 1: Truck driver

Since the person who ate fried rice lives next to the person who drives a minivan, and the person who drives a minivan lives next to the mystery book reader, the only house left for the fried rice eater is house 11.

So, the person who ate fried rice lives in house 11.

The correct answer is **(A) 5**."

   - House 3: Red

4. There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.

   - This means the person who likes green lives in house 2 and the person who likes blue lives in house 3.

   - House 1: Spaghetti
   - House 2: Green
   - House 3: Blue
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

8. There is one house between where the science fiction book fanatic lives and where the person who likes red lives.
   - This is already covered in clue 4.

9. The person who had pizza lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - This means the person who had pizza lives in house 3 and the basketball player lives in house 4.

   - House 1: Spaghetti
   - House 2: Green
   - House 3: Pizza
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

10. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
    - House 1: Spaghetti

11. The violinist and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.

   - House 1: Spaghetti
   - House 2: Violinist
   - House 3: Blue
   - House 4: Science fiction book fanatic

From the clues, we can see that the person who had pizza lives in house 3.

So, the number of the house where the person who had pizza lives is **3**."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:
1. The violinist lives in the second house.
2. The basketball player lives in the second house.
3. The cellist lives to the right of the cricketer.

From clue 2, we know the violinist lives in the second house. So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: ?
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: ?

From clue 3, the violinist lives in the second house, so the violinist is in House 2.

From clue 1, the cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer can't be in House 3, because the cellist would then be in House 3, which would make the cellist to the left of the cricketer. So, the cricketer must be in House 1, and the cellist must be in House 3.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Cricketer
- House 2: Violinist
- House 3: Cellist

Since the basketball player lives in the second house, the basketball player is in House 2. This leaves the soccer player to live in House 1 or House 3. But we already know the cricketer lives in House 1 and the cellist lives in House 3.

Therefore, the soccer player must live in House 1.

The number of the house where the soccer player lives is **(A) 1**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler clues:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the fourth house.
2. The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house.
3. The history book buff lives next to the person who has lilies.
4. The person who likes white doesn't live in the third house.
5. The person who has daffodils doesn't live in the first house.
6. The person who has carnations doesn't live in the fourth house.
7. The person who has carnations lives next to the tea drinker.
8. The tea drinker lives next to the person who likes red.
9. The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader live next to each other.

Now, let's figure out where each person lives:

- The mystery book reader is in the fourth house.
- The person who only drinks water is also in the fourth house, but this is a contradiction because the fourth house is already taken by the mystery book reader. So, we need to re-evaluate this.
- The history book buff is next to the person who has lilies.
- The person who likes white can't be in the third house.
- The person who has daffodils can't be in the first house.
- The person who has carnations can't be in the fourth house.
- The person who has carnations is next to the tea drinker.
- The tea drinker is next to the person who likes red.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader are next to each other.

Since the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, the fantasy book enthusiast and the mystery book reader must be next to each other. So, the fantasy book enthusiast could be in the third house, and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house.

Now, the person who likes white can't be in the third house, so the person who likes white must be in the first or second house. The person who has daffodils can't be in the first house, so the person who has daffodils must be in the second or third house. The person who has carnations can't be in the fourth house, so the person who has carnations must be in the first or second house.

Since the person who has carnations is next to the tea drinker, and the tea drinker is next to the person who likes red, the tea drinker must be in the second house. This means the person who likes red is in the first house.

So, the tea drinker lives in the second house.

The answer is (C) 2."

From clue 2, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house, which is consistent with clue 11.

From clue 3, the flutist lives in the fourth house, which is consistent with clue 2.

From clue 4, the tennis player doesn't live in the fourth house. So, the tennis player must live in one of the other houses (1, 2, or 3).

From clue 5, the guitarist doesn't live in the third house. So, the guitarist must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 6, the violinist doesn't live in the third house. So, the violinist must live in either the first or the second house.

From clue 7, the guitarist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer. This means the cricketer must live in the first or second house, and the guitarist must live in the third or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the guitarist must live in the third house. Therefore, the cricketer must live in the first or second house.

From clue 8, the dog owner and the root beer lover live next to each other. This means they must be in adjacent houses.

From clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. This means the basketball player must live in the first or second house, and the fish enthusiast must live in the third or fourth house. Since the fourth house is occupied by the person who owns horses, the fish enthusiast must live in the third house.

From clue 10, the person who only drinks water and the tennis player live next to each other. This means they must be in adjacent houses.

Given all these constraints, let's summarize:
- Fourth house: Person who owns horses (clue 11)
- Third house: Guitarist (clue 7)
- Second house: Cricketer (clue 7)
- First house: Tennis player (clue 4)
- First or second house: Fish enthusiast (clue 9)
- First or second house: Basketball player (clue 9)
- First or second house: Root beer lover (clue 8)
- First or second house: Person who only drinks water (clue 10)

Since the fish enthusiast must live somewhere to the right of the basketball player, and the basketball player must be in the first or second house, the fish enthusiast must be in the third house.

Therefore, the fish enthusiast lives in the third house. The correct answer is (C) 3."

Now, let's fill in the houses:
- First house: Person eating oranges

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The person wearing boots lives in the second house.
   - So, house 2 has boots.

2. The person wearing high heels lives next to the dog owner.
   - Since the person wearing boots is in house 2, the person wearing high heels must be in house 1.
   - House 1 has high heels.

3. The person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.
   - So, house 3 has a sedan.

4. The person who owns an SUV lives next to the person wearing boots.
   - Since the person wearing boots is in house 2, the person who owns an SUV must be in house 1.
   - But we already know house 1 has high heels, so this clue doesn't change anything.

5. The cat lover lives in the first house.
   - So, house 1 has a cat lover.

Now we know:
- House 1: High Heels (cat lover)
- House 2: Boots (person wearing boots)
- House 3: Sedan (person who owns a sedan)

The only house left is house 3, and we know the person who owns a sedan lives there. The only thing left is the person who is wearing running shoes.

So, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."

     - House 1: Person who likes blue
     - House 2: Person who is eating kiwis
     - House 3: Tea drinker

3. The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.
   - Since the tea drinker is in House 3, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples must be in Houses 1 and 2.
   - House 1: Person who likes blue (already known)
   - House 2: Person who is eating kiwis (already known)
   - House 1: Person who likes milk
   - House 2: Person who is eating apples

   - Since House 1 already has the person with carnations, the person who is eating oranges must be in House 2.

So, the person who is eating apples must be in House 2.

The person who is eating apples lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have three houses, and each house has a different person living in it. We know the following:

1. One person likes mystery books, one likes science fiction books, and one likes history books.
2. One person has a computer, one has a television, and one has a phone.

Here are the clues:
1. The mystery book reader lives next to the history book buff.
2. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
3. The person with the computer lives next to the person with the phone.
4. The mystery book reader lives next to the person with the television.

From clue 2, we know the mystery book reader lives in the first house. So, the first house is for the mystery book reader.

From clue 1, the mystery book reader lives next to the history book buff. So, the history book buff must be in the second house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: History book buff

From clue 3, the person with the computer lives next to the person with the phone. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the phone must be in the first house (because they can't be in the second house). So, the first house is for the mystery book reader, and the second house is for the history book buff.

From clue 4, the mystery book reader lives next to the person with the television. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the person with the television must be in the second house. But we already know the second house is for the history book buff. So, the person with the television must be in the third house.

Now we have:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: History book buff
- House 3: Person with the television

(A) Izzi.
(B) Helga.
(C) Sam.
(D) Karl.
(E) Patrick.
(F) Lola.
(G) Melissa.

From the sequence of switches, we can see that Gertrude's partner at the end is Eve, but since Eve is not an option, we need to consider the last switch where Gertrude switches with Eve, and the only logical final partner for Gertrude is the one that fits the sequence of switches and the given options.
