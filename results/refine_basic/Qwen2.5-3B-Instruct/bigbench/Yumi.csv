"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
2. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
3. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
4. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
9. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
11. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
12. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person in the third house is wearing high heels, the third house is house number 3.

Now, let's use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos. Since the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The person who had pizza must be in house 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(A) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
2. The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
3. The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
4. The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
5. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
7. The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From Clue 4, we know the person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house. This means the fifth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water.

From Clue 6, the person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house. This means the third house is occupied by the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 7, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other. Since the fifth house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who had stew and the person who likes milk must be in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 3, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew. This means the person who had stew must be in house 1 and the root beer lover in house 2.

From Clue 5, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in house 3, the coffee drinker must be in house 2.

This leaves house 4 for the person who only drinks water, which is consistent with Clue 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who had stew
- House 2: Person who likes milk
- House 3: Person who ate spaghetti
- House 4: Person who only drinks water
- House 5: Person who only drinks water (already placed)

Thus, the person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5.

The answer is (A) 5."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. The violinist lives in House 1.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 1.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.
4. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
5. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
7. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the history book buff lives.
8. The violinist lives in the first house.

From these, we can deduce:
- House 1: Violinist (and also the person who ate spaghetti)
- House 3: Person who ate fried rice (and also the history book buff)
- House 2: Person with a vase of tulips and person with a phone (since they must be next to each other)

Since the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be to the left of the percussionist and the violinist is in House 1, the person with a bouquet of daffodils must be in House 1. This leaves House 2 for the person with a vase of tulips and the person with a phone.

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips must live in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This means if the history book buff is in house 1, the convertible driver must be in house 2.
   - Conversely, if the history book buff is in house 2, the convertible driver must be in house 1.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the person wearing boots must live in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know the person in house 2 is wearing boots and driving a truck. 

From Clue 1, since the person in house 2 is driving a truck, the person in house 1 must be driving a convertible. This means the person in house 1 is not wearing boots, so they must be wearing sandals.

The person in house 1 is a mystery book reader (since they are not the history book buff), and the person in house 2 is a history book buff.

Therefore, the person wearing sandals lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The answer is (C) 4."
The correct option is (B) 3.
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a gameboy.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow does not live in the second house.

Let's start by placing the person who likes yellow:
- Since the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 2, they must be in either house 1 or house 3.

### Case 1: The person who likes yellow is in house 1.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 1, then the person who likes green must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a gameboy must be in house 3 (since they are neighbors with the person who likes green).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement contradicts Clue 2, which states that the person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer. Therefore, the person who likes yellow cannot be in house 1.

### Case 2: The person who likes yellow is in house 3.
- If the person who likes yellow is in house 3, then the person who has a gameboy must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who likes green must be in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
- The person who has a computer must be in house 2 (since they are neighbors with the person who has a gameboy).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues:
- The person who likes green (in house 1) is directly left of the person who has a gameboy (in house 2).
- The person who has a gameboy (in house 2) is directly left of the person who has a computer (in house 2).
- The person who likes yellow (in house 3) is not in the second house.

Thus, the person who has a computer lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (A) 2."
"Let's analyze the clues step by step to determine the house where the coffee drinker lives.

1. **Clue 1:** There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.
3. **Clue 3:** The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The romance book lover does not live in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.
6. **Clue 6:** The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who likes red lives in the third house.
8. **Clue 8:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
9. **Clue 9:** The tea drinker does not live in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the root beer lover lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the root beer lover.

From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house. This means the root beer lover and the person who likes red are in the same house, which contradicts Clue 5. Therefore, Clue 5 must be incorrect, and the root beer lover does not live in the third house. This means the root beer lover must live in one of the other houses.

From Clue 8, the romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff. This means the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses.

From Clue 9, the tea drinker does not live in the second house. So, the tea drinker must live in either the first, third, or fourth house.

Let's summarize the information we have so far:
- The third house is occupied by the root beer lover.
- The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
- The tea drinker is not in the second house.

Let's try to place the people based on the clues:

1. The root beer lover is in the third house.
2. The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
3. The tea drinker is not in the second house.

If the tea drinker is in the first house, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in the second and fourth houses, respectively. This leaves the green drinker and the yellow drinker for the second and fourth houses, but the green drinker cannot be in the fourth house (Clue 2). So, the green drinker must be in the second house, and the yellow drinker must be in the fourth house.

This leaves the red drinker and the coffee drinker for the first and fourth houses. Since the red drinker is in the third house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house.

So, the coffee drinker lives in the first house.

Therefore, the answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house numbers:

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
   - This means if the person with the radio is in house 1, the person who likes green must be in house 2.
   - If the person with the radio is in house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1.

2. **The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.

3. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the fish enthusiast must live in house 2.

4. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who had pizza must live in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The fish enthusiast lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The person who had pizza lives in house 2.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
  - Since the person who likes green lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), the person who has a radio must live in house 1 (since house 1 is directly left of house 2).

So, we have:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who had pizza (in house 2) and the person who likes green (in house 2) are already determined, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in house 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in house 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in house 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.
   - This means the person in house 2 does not wear boots.

3. The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person with horses lives in house 1 and the person with a radio lives in house 2, or vice versa.

From Clue 1, we know the person in house 1 has a phone. From Clue 2, the person in house 2 does not wear boots. From Clue 3, the person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live next to each other.

Since the person in house 1 has a phone, the person in house 2 must be wearing boots. Therefore, the person in house 1 must be wearing high heels.

The characteristics are:
- House 1: Owns horses, wears high heels, has a radio.
- House 2: Wears boots, has a phone.

Thus, the person who is wearing high heels lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

From Clue 5"
"The bird keeper lives in House 1.

So, the correct answer is (D) 1."
"The soccer player lives in house 1. 

So, the correct option is:
(A) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The cat lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives.
8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house and is directly left of the person who had fried rice. Therefore, the person who had fried rice must live in the second house.

From Clue 2, the cat lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 1, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live next to each other. Since the cat lover is in the third house, the person who has a phone and the person who had pizza must be in the first and second houses. Since the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house, the person who had pizza must be in the second house.

From Clue 10, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. Since the person who had fried rice is in the second house, the person who had stew must be in the first house, but we already know the person who ate grilled cheese is in the first house. This means the person who had stew must be in the fourth house, and the person who ate fried rice must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 8, the bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who had stew is in the fourth house, the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fifth house, and the bird keeper must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 7, there is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives. Since the bird keeper is in the fourth house, the person who has a television must be in the third house.

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy. Since the person who has a television is in the third house, the person who owns horses must be in the second house, and the person who has a gameboy must be in the fourth house.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who ate grilled cheese
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who owns horses
- House 4: Person who has a television
- House 5: Person who had stew

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct arrangement step by step:

1. **Pianist does not live in the first house.**
2. **Person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.**
3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other. Also, the person eating kiwis must be to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio next to each other. Also, the person eating oranges must be directly left of the person with a television.

- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, we need to place the person with a television directly left of the person with a radio.

- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Thus, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The correct answer is (A) 8."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **The tea drinker does not live in the first house.**
2. **The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.**
3. **The person who likes red does not live in the third house.**
4. **The person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.**
5. **The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow.**
6. **There are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.**

10. **The person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.**
11. **The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.**
12. **The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green.**
13. **The person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.**

From Clue 7, the person who likes milk lives in the third house. So, the third house is occupied by the milk drinker.

From Clue 2, the person who is eating apples lives in the third house. This is a contradiction because the third house is already occupied by the milk drinker. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the setup.

Let's assume the person who is eating apples lives in the second house. Then the third house is occupied by the milk drinker.

From Clue 1, the tea drinker does not live in the first house. So, the tea drinker can live in the second, third, fourth, or fifth house. Since the third house is occupied by the milk drinker, the tea drinker must live in the second, fourth, or fifth house.

From Clue 3, the person who likes red does not live in the third house. So, the person who likes red can live in the first, second, fourth, or fifth house.

From Clue 4, the person who likes milk and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who is eating a banana must be in the second house.

From Clue 5, the person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who likes yellow. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who only drinks water must be in the second house, and the person who likes yellow must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 6, there are two houses between where the root beer lover lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the root beer lover must be in the first or fifth house, and the person who is eating kiwis must be in the fourth or fifth house. Since the person who likes yellow is in the fourth house, the person who is eating kiwis must be in the fifth house, and the root beer lover must be in the first house.

From Clue 8, the person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes milk. Since the milk drinker is in the third house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth (fifth) house. Since the person who is eating kiwis is in the fifth house, the person who owns an SUV must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 9, the person who likes red lives somewhere to the left of the person who only drinks water. Since the milk drinker is in the third house and the person who only drinks water is in the second house, the person who likes red must be in the first house.

From Clue 10, the person who drives a convertible lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the person who likes red is in the first house, the person who drives a convertible must be in the second house.

From Clue 11, the person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the person who drives a truck is in the fifth house, the person who likes blue must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 12, the person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green is in the fifth house, the person who is eating mangos must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 13, the person who owns a sedan and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other. Since the person who likes yellow is in the fourth house, the person who owns a sedan must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in the third house.

The answer is (B) 3."

So, the correct option is (B) 2."
"Based on the given clues, the person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 5.

So, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Based on the clues provided, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 10:** The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.
2. **Clue 3:** The saxophonist lives in the second house.
3. **Clue 8:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the saxophonist, so the pizza eater must be in house 3.
4. **Clue 7:** The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
5. **Clue 6:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
6. **Clue 5:** The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker.
7. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
8. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
9. **Clue 4:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
10. **Clue 9:** The flutist does not live in the fourth house.

From Clue 10, the tea drinker is in house 4. From Clue 3, the saxophonist is in house 2. From Clue 8, the pizza eater is in house 3. From Clue 5, the cellist is in house 3 (since the cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker, who is in house 4). From Clue 6, the person who only drinks water is in house 1 (since the cellist is in house 3, the person who only drinks water must be in house 2, and the person who is wearing loafers must be in house 3).

From Clue 2, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 1 (since the pizza eater is in house 3, and the person who is wearing running shoes must be to the left of the pizza eater).

From Clue 4, the person who had stew must be in house 2 (since the person who is wearing running shoes is in house 1, and the person who had stew must be to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes).

From Clue 1, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 2 (since the person who had stew is in house 2, and the person who is wearing sandals must be to the left of the person who likes milk).

From Clue 7, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 4 (since the cellist is in house 3, and the person who ate fried rice must be to the right of the cellist).

So, the house where the cellist lives is house 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
6. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the minivan driver lives in house 4. So, the arrangement for houses 1-4 is:
- House 4 (Minivan driver): Root beer lover.
- House 3 (Root beer lover): Root beer lover.
- House 2 (Swimmer): The swimmer must be to the left of the sedan owner, and the sedan owner must be to the left of the truck driver. Since the root beer lover is in house 3, the swimmer must be in house 2.
- House 1 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 1.
- House 4 (Minivan driver): The minivan driver lives in house 4.
- House 3 (Root beer lover): The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- House 2 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 2.
- House 1 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 1.
- House 3 (Root beer lover): The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- House 4 (Minivan driver): The minivan driver lives in house 4.
- House 2 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 2.
- House 1 (Swimmer): The swimmer lives in house 1.
- House 3 (Root beer lover): The root beer lover lives in house 3.
- House 4 (Minivan driver): The minivan driver lives in house 4.

From Clue 8, the basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck. Since the truck driver must be in house 1 (as house 1 is the only house left for the truck driver to live in), the basketball player must be in house 2.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in house 2, the person with the lilies must be in house 3 or 4. But since the root beer lover is in house 3, the person with the lilies must be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the truck driver is in house 1, the person with carnations must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, the swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan. Since the swimmer is in house 1, the person who owns a sedan must be in house 2.

From Clue 6, the tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker. Since the tennis player is in house 1 and the tea drinker must be in house 4, the tennis player is in house 1 and the tea drinker is in house 4.

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the tennis player. Since the tennis player is in house 1, the coffee drinker must be in house 4.

From Clue 7, the swimmer does not live in the first house. Since the swimmer is in house 1, this is consistent.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(A) 1**."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house.
2. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person driving a minivan.
3. The person driving a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives.
5. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house.

From Clue 1, we know the tea drinker is in house 1.

From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be in house 1 or 2, and the person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.

From Clue 3, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3, and the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 5, the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 3.

Let's test the possible positions:

- If the person eating oranges is in house 1 (Clue 5), then the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The person eating apples must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3. Since the person eating apples is in house 2, the person driving a convertible must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person driving a minivan is in house 3, and the person eating oranges is in house 1.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person driving a convertible is in house 3, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in house 2, and the coffee drinker must be in house 3.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.
   - This directly tells us that the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

2. **Clue 2**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - If the SUV owner is in house 3, the person in house 2 must be the mystery book reader, and the person in house 1 must be the person who drives a convertible.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - Since the SUV owner is in house 3, the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 1 or 2. But house 1 is already taken by the person who drives a convertible, so the person with the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - The person who drives a convertible is in house 1, so the person who is eating mangos must be in house 2.

5. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - The person who drives a minivan must be in house 2 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible), and the dog owner must be in house 3.

6. **Clue 7**: There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
   - The person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since house 1 is taken by the person who drives a convertible, house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, and house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV). The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 4. Since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos, the bird keeper must be in house 4.

7. **Clue 8**: The bird keeper lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - The bird keeper is in house 4, so the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. But house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to recheck the placement.

8. **Clue 9**: The person who drives a minivan and the history book buff live directly next to each other.
   - The person who drives a minivan is in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 3 is taken by the person who owns an SUV, the history book buff must be in house 1.

9. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - The person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in house 1 (since house 2 is taken by the person who is eating mangos), and the romance book lover must be in house 4.

10. **Clue 11**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
    - The person who has a carnations arrangement is in house 3, and the person who is eating grapes must be in house 4.

Given all these clues, the only consistent placement is:

- House 1: Person who drives a convertible
- House 2: Person who is eating mangos
- House 3: Person who owns an SUV
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"The root beer lover lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"The science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 4"
"The person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house (number 2). 

So, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The violinist lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

So, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"The person who has a computer lives in house 2.

So, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic (SFF) lives somewhere to the left of the golfer (Golfer).
   - This means SFF is in House 1 and Golfer is in House 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) live directly next to each other.
   - This means PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses. Since Golfer is in House 2, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist (G) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils (D).
   - This means G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D. Since Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 2 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"

2. **House 2: Phone**

3. **House 3: Television**

4. **House 4: Violinist**

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house. So, house 1 has lilies.
2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house. Therefore, the basketball player must live in house 2.
3. **Clue 1 and Clue 2:** The person with the radio lives somewhere to the right of the person eating apples and also to the right of the violinist. This means the person eating apples must be to the left of the violinist, and the violinist must be to the right of the person with the radio.

From Clue 3, we know house 1 has lilies. Since the basketball player cannot be in house 1 (Clue 4), the basketball player must be in house 2. This means the person eating apples must be in house 1, and the violinist must be in house 2.

Therefore, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is **(B) 2**."
"The cricketer lives in the 2nd house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is **(A) 2**."
"The root beer lover lives in house number 3.

(C) 3"
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

From the above deductions, we can see that the only consistent arrangement that fits all the clues is:

- **House 1: Fried rice eater**
- **House 2: History book buff**
- **House 3: Science fiction book fanatic**
- **House 4: Banana eater**
- **House 5: Pizza eater**

Given the constraints, the mystery book reader must be in the second house, as the romance book lover and the mystery book reader are next to each other, and the only available house for the mystery book reader is the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the mystery book reader lives is **(A) 2**."
"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 3. 

So, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is:
(B) 2"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses. We'll start by analyzing the constraints and placing the people accordingly.

1. **Clue 13**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.
2. **Clue 12**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. **Clue 11**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
4. **Clue 10**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the pianist.

6. **Clue 8**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the guitarist.
8. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 5**: The person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
10. **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.
11. **Clue 3**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
12. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
13. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.

From Clue 13, we know the person who likes blue must be in a house to the left of the person who had pizza. Let's assume the person who likes blue is in house 1, then the person who had pizza must be in house 3 or 4. Since the person who likes blue cannot be in house 4 (because of Clue 11), the person who likes blue must be in house 1, and the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

From Clue 12, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in a house to the right of the violinist. From Clue 8, the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be directly left of the guitarist. This means the guitarist must be in house 4, and the person who has a bouquet of lilies must be in house 2.

From Clue 10, the person who likes green must be in a house to the left of the pianist. From Clue 9, there are two houses between the person who likes green and the pianist. This means the pianist must be in house 4, and the person who likes green must be in house 2.

From Clue 5, the person who had pizza and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be next to each other. Since the person who had pizza is in house 3, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 2.

From Clue 4, the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2, and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the person who is wearing sandals must be in house 1, and the person who ate spaghetti must be in house 4.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing sandals
- House 2: Person who has a bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Person who had pizza
- House 4: Person who is wearing running shoes

Therefore, the person who likes white lives in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"The person who only drinks water lives in House 1.

So, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The person who likes red lives in the first house.
2. The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
3. The person who ate grilled cheese and the person who likes white live directly next to each other.
4. There is one house between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who has a computer lives.
5. The soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.
6. The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the cricketer.
7. The person who is eating grapes lives in the first house.

From Clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese (in house 1) and the person who likes white (in house 2) are adjacent.

From Clue 5, the person who is eating apples (in house 2) lives to the right of the soccer player (in house 3).

From Clue 4, there is one house between the person who has a radio (in house 2) and the person who has a computer (in house 3).

From Clue 2, the person who had pizza (in house 1) lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer (in house 3).

Given all these constraints, we can conclude that the person who likes red lives in house number 1.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

"The number of the house where the history book buff lives is 3.

So, the correct answer is (A) 3."
"The dog owner lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct option is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 2:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Minivan

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
   - This means the person with a phone and the person with an SUV must be adjacent, and the phone must be to the left of the SUV.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a gameboy.
   - Since the gameboy is in house 3, the radio must be in house 4.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

From the above, we know:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be adjacent to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 2: Phone
- House 4: SUV

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the correct house where the person who likes red lives step by step:

1. **Clue 10**: The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner.

2. **Clue 11**: The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - The person who is wearing loafers cannot live in the first house (Clue 7), so they must live in the second or third house. Since the dog owner lives in the third house, the person who is wearing loafers must live in the second house. Therefore, the person who owns an SUV must live in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 9**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the root beer lover and the coffee drinker must be in adjacent houses, with the root beer lover to the left of the coffee drinker.

   - This means the person who drives a minivan and the person who is wearing sandals must be in adjacent houses, with the minivan driver to the left of the person wearing sandals.

5. **Clue 2**: The dog owner lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
   - The dog owner lives in the third house (Clue 4), so the person who only drinks water must live in the second house.

6. **Clue 12**: The person who likes white lives in the third house.

7. **Clue 13**: The fish enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot live in the first house, so the person who likes white must live in the fourth house.

Let's summarize the information we have:
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio

- First house: root beer lover
- Second house: tea drinker
- Third house: cricketer, loafers, radio

- Fifth house: person who likes milk
- Sixth house: person who had stew
- Seventh house: person who ate fried rice
- Seventh house: person who had stew
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers (since the person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house, and the third house is occupied by the cricketer, the person who is wearing loafers must be in the eighth house)
- Eighth house: person who is wearing loafers

"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).

From the first clue, if the person who ate fried rice is in house 2, then the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1. This is because the fried rice eater is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is (B) 1."
"The dog owner lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

3. There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the fried rice eater and fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2.

4. The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

5. The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

6. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

7. The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

Now, let's place the known elements:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater

Since the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively, and the guitarist must be to the left of the violinist, the only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement looks like this:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water lives in house 1. From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2. This means the person who likes milk must be in house 3 because there is one house between house 1 and house 3. 

Now, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 or house 3. Since house 1 is already occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: History book buff

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza does not live in house 1, so they must live in either house 2 or house 3. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who ate fried rice must live somewhere to the right of the romance book lover. Since the romance book lover is in house 2, the person who ate fried rice must be in house 3.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3, the sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors), and the lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3). The tulip person must live in house 2, but this is a contradiction because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2, the sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors), and the lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2). The tulip person must live in house 2, but this is a contradiction because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 1.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

"The person who likes blue lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"The bird keeper lives in the second house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (number 1), which contradicts the fantasy book enthusiast. Therefore, we need to reassess. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house, and the cellist must live in the second house (number 2).

- The person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

Now, we need to determine the mystery book reader. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green and the person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).

6. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\).

### Analyzing the Clues:
- **Clue 6**: Mystery book reader in house 1 (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- **Clue 4**: Fantasy book enthusiast in house 2 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer).
- **Clue 1**: There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet.

"Given the clues, let's analyze the positions of the people and the fruits step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

**Clue 1:** The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
- Possible pairs: (1, 2) or (2, 3).

**Clue 4:** There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1.

**Clue 3:** There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the person eating grapes must be in house 3.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the person eating grapes must be in house 1.

**Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
- If the violinist is in house 1, the flutist must be in house 3.
- If the violinist is in house 3, the flutist must be in house 2.

### Combining Clues:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1:
  - Violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 2 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 3 (Clue 3), but house 3 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2:
  - Violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4).
  - Flutist must be in house 3 (Clue 2).
  - Person eating grapes must be in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

### Correct Configuration:

- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3).

This configuration satisfies all the clues:
- The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other (Clue 1).
- The flutist is to the right of the violinist (Clue 2).
- There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis (Clue 3).
- There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis (Clue 4).

Therefore, the pianist lives in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house, and the person eating kiwis lives in the first house. Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast must live in the second house.

"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 1. This leaves house 2 for the pianist and cellist, with the pianist to the left of the cellist.

Therefore, the number of the house where the root beer lover lives is:

(A) 1"
"The person who has the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4."
"The pianist lives in house 2. 

So, the correct answer is (D) 2."

"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other, the science fiction book fanatic must live in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people. From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

So, we have:
- House 1: Person drinking water, Person wearing sandals
- House 2: Person eating kiwis, Person liking yellow

Since the person drinking water is in house 1, the person wearing high heels must be in house 2 (from Clue 1).

- The cellist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1), so the cellist must be in house 2.
- The violinist cannot be in house 3 (Clue 4), so the violinist must be in house 2 (but that's already taken by the cellist), so the violinist must be in house 3.
- The guitarist must be in house 1 (since the cellist is in house 2 and there is one house between the violinist and the guitarist).

Therefore, the guitarist lives in house 1.

The correct answer is (B) 1."
"The person who only drinks water lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 4"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 7:** The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza

2. **Clue 6:** The person who has a radio does not live in the fourth house.
   - The radio cannot be in house 4.

3. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - This means the grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in adjacent houses.

4. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who ate grilled cheese lives and where the person who has a radio lives.
   - This means the grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house.

5. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the person who has a gameboy lives and where the person who ate fried rice lives.
   - This means the gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house.

6. **Clue 2:** The person who has a television lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a phone.
   - The television and phone must be in houses with the television to the left of the phone.

Let's place the pizza in house 4:
- House 4: Pizza

Now, the radio cannot be in house 4, so it must be in one of houses 1, 2, 3, or 5. Let's try placing the radio in house 2:
- House 2: Radio
- House 4: Pizza

The grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house, so the grilled cheese must be in house 1:
- House 1: Grilled Cheese
- House 2: Radio

Now, the grilled cheese and spaghetti must be in adjacent houses, so the spaghetti must be in house 2:
- House 1: Grilled Cheese
- House 2: Grilled Cheese and Spaghetti

This configuration is not possible because the radio is already in house 2. So, let's try placing the radio in house 3:
- House 1: Grilled Cheese
- House 3: Radio

Now, the grilled cheese and radio must be separated by one house, so the spaghetti must be in house 2:
- House 1: Grilled Cheese
- House 2: Spaghetti
- House 3: Radio

The gameboy and fried rice must be separated by one house. The gameboy cannot be in house 1 or 2, so it must be in house 3:
- House 1: Grilled Cheese
- House 2: Spaghetti
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Pizza

The fried rice must be in house 5:
- House 1: Grilled Cheese
- House 2: Spaghetti
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried Rice

Finally, the computer must be in house 1:
- House 1: Computer
- House 2: Spaghetti
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Fried Rice

Therefore, the person who ate spaghetti lives in house 2.

The answer is (C) 2."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house for the person who is eating a banana step by step:

1. **Pianist and Horse Owner**: The pianist lives directly left of the person who owns horses.
2. **Apples and Kiwis**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
3. **Baseball Player and Fried Rice**: The baseball player and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
4. **Apples in Second House**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the second house.
5. **Fried Rice and Oranges**: The person who ate fried rice and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
6. **Dog Owner and First House**: The dog owner does not live in the first house.
7. **Bird Keeper in Second House**: The bird keeper lives in the second house.

9. **Stew and Banana**: The person who had stew and the person who is eating a banana live directly next to each other.
10. **Saxophonist and Grilled Cheese**: The saxophonist and the person who ate grilled cheese live directly next to each other.
11. **Tennis Player and Baseball Player**: The tennis player and the baseball player live directly next to each other.
12. **Basketball Player and Cat Lover**: The basketball player lives directly left of the cat lover.
13. **Saxophonist and Golfer**: There is one house between where the saxophonist lives and where the golfer lives.
14. **Mangos and Horse**: The person who is eating mangos lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
15. **Tennis Player in First House**: The tennis player lives in the first house.
16. **Percussionist in Fourth House**: The percussionist lives in the fourth house.
17. **Pianist Not in Third House**: The pianist does not live in the third house.
18. **Apples and Golfer**: The person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
19. **Pizza and Fifth House**: The person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

From clue 15, the tennis player lives in the first house. From clue 16, the percussionist lives in the fourth house. From clue 17, the pianist does not live in the third house. From clue 18, the person who is eating apples lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos. From clue 19, the person who had pizza does not live in the fifth house.

Given that the pianist does not live in the third house, and considering the positions of the other musicians and their pets, we can deduce the following:

- The pianist must live in the second house (since the bird keeper is in the second house and the pianist cannot be in the third house).
- The person who is eating a banana must live somewhere to the right of the pianist, so the person who is eating a banana must live in the fourth or fifth house.
- The percussionist lives in the fourth house, so the person who is eating a banana must live in the fifth house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating a banana lives is **5**.

The correct answer is (A) 5."
"The person who had pizza lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in house number 3.

(A) 3"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of the people living in them.

1. **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
2. **Clue 2**: The percussionist does not live in the second house.
3. **Clue 3**: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the second house.
4. **Clue 4**: The history book buff does not live in the second house.
5. **Clue 5**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating a banana.

8. **Clue 8**: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. **Clue 9**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.
10. **Clue 10**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the flutist.

From Clue 10, we know the fantasy book enthusiast and the flutist must be in the first and third houses, respectively, or the second and third houses, respectively. However, Clue 9 tells us the fantasy book enthusiast must be to the left of the flutist, so they must be in the first and third houses.

Let's place the fantasy book enthusiast in the first house and the flutist in the third house.

- **First House**: Fantasy book enthusiast
- **Second House**: Pianist (since the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first house)
- **Third House**: Flutist

Now, let's place the fish enthusiast and the person eating a banana. From Clue 5, the fish enthusiast must be to the right of the person eating a banana. Since the fish enthusiast is in the third house, the person eating a banana must be in the second house. This contradicts Clue 2, which states the percussionist does not live in the second house. Therefore, the fish enthusiast must be in the second house, and the person eating a banana must be in the first house.

- **First House**: Person eating a banana
- **Second House**: Fish enthusiast
- **Third House**: Flutist

Now, the person wearing running shoes must be in the first house (Clue 8), and the person wearing loafers must be in the third house (Clue 1). This leaves the pianist to be in the second house.

- **First House**: Person eating a banana
- **Second House**: Fish enthusiast
- **Third House**: Flutist

The remaining characteristics are:
- **Person eating a banana**: Cat lover (Clue 10)
- **Person wearing running shoes**: Cat lover (Clue 8)
- **Person wearing loafers**: Cat lover (Clue 1)
- **Pianist**: Cat lover (Clue 10)
- **Fish enthusiast**: Cat lover (Clue 8)
- **Flutist**: Cat lover (Clue 10)

Since the cat lover lives in the first house, the science fiction book fanatic must live in the third house.

**The number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is 3.**

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4."
"The person who had stew lives in house 1.

So, the correct option is:
(A) 1"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3** tells us the root beer lover lives in house 1.
2. **Clue 2** states the person who only drinks water lives in house 2.
3. **Clue 4** says the person who has a television does not live in house 2, so they must live in either house 1 or house 3.
4. **Clue 5** indicates the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 3, the root beer lover is in house 1. From Clue 2, the person who only drinks water is in house 2. This leaves house 3 for the person who likes root beer.

Now, considering Clue 1, the person with the daffodils must be directly left of the person with the phone. Since the person with the daffodils is in house 2 (from Clue 2), the person with the phone must be in house 3.

This leaves house 1 for the person who likes root beer.

Therefore, the person who likes root beer lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"The person who has a computer lives in House 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."

"The person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

So, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"The correct option is (B) 4.

To elaborate on the reasoning in a concise manner:

1. The saxophonist is in the second house.
2. The mystery book reader is in the first house.
3. The percussionist must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the percussionist is in the third or fourth house.
4. The science fiction book fanatic is to the left of the percussionist, so the science fiction book fanatic is in the first or second house. Since the saxophonist is in the second house, the science fiction book fanatic must be in the first house.
5. The guitarist is to the left of the percussionist, so the guitarist is in the first house.
6. The fantasy book enthusiast is to the left of the flutist, so the fantasy book enthusiast is in the first or second house. Since the saxophonist is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the first house.
7. The history book buff is in the house directly to the right of the mystery book reader, so the history book buff is in the second house.
8. The person who ate spaghetti cannot be in the third house, so the person who ate spaghetti must be in the fourth or fifth house.
9. The person who ate grilled cheese must be to the right of the mystery book reader, so the person who ate grilled cheese must be in the fifth house.
10. The person who ate fried rice must be in the fourth house.

Therefore, the percussionist lives in the fourth house."
"The person who is eating mangos lives in house number 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5."

So, the correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - This clue is consistent with the arrangement where the root beer lover is in house 1 and the guitarist is in house 2.

From the above, we can deduce:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Since the root beer lover and the guitarist must be in houses 1 and 2, and the guitarist must be next to the root beer lover, the guitarist must be in house 1 and the root beer lover must be in house 2.

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

   - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3.
   - If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this scenario is not possible.

2. **Clue 2**: The dog owner does not live in the second house.
   - This means the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 3 if the dog owner lives in house 1.
   - The person with the vase of tulips must live in house 2 if the dog owner lives in house 3.

Considering these clues, let's analyze the possibilities:

- If the dog owner is in house 1:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1).
  - The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 1.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 (Clue 3).

- If the dog owner is in house 3:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The bird keeper must be in house 1 or house 2.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 3.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 (Clue 3).

From the above analysis, the only consistent scenario is when the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**.

So, the correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 4**: The swimmer lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Swimmer

2. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating apples does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not apples

3. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is wearing boots lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
   - Possible positions for boots and kiwis: (1, 3) or (2, 4)

4. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not loafers

5. **Clue 6**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the cricketer.
   - Possible positions for tulips and cricketer: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4)

6. **Clue 7**: The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - House 1: Phone, House 2: Sandals

7. **Clue 8**: The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a computer.
   - House 1: Oranges, House 2: Computer

8. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not lilies

9. **Clue 10**: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not loafers

10. **Clue 11**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who is eating a banana.
    - Possible positions for rose bouquet and banana: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4)

12. **Clue 12**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the basketball player.
    - Possible positions for gameboy and basketball player: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4)

Let's combine these clues:

- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Sandals, Computer
- **House 3**: Not apples, Not lilies, Not loafers, Not gameboy, Not basketball player, Not rose bouquet, Not banana
- **House 4**: Swimmer

Since House 3 cannot be apples, lilies, loafers, gameboy, or banana, and it must be something else, let's consider the remaining options for House 3:

- **House 3**: Banana (since it's the only option left that fits the clues)

Now, let's place the remaining items:

- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Sandals, Computer
- **House 3**: Banana
- **House 4**: Swimmer

Since House 3 is occupied by the banana, the remaining items for House 3 are not apples, lilies, loafers, gameboy, or banana. The only remaining option is the basketball player.

- **House 3**: Basketball Player
- **House 4**: Swimmer

Now, the remaining items for House 1 and House 2 are:

- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Sandals, Computer

Since House 2 cannot be loafers, and the only remaining option is the gameboy:

- **House 2**: Gameboy, Sandals
- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges

Finally, the only remaining item for House 1 is the computer, and for House 2 is the loafers.

- **House 1**: Phone, Oranges
- **House 2**: Gameboy, Sandals
- **House 3**: Basketball Player
- **House 4**: Swimmer

Thus, the person who is wearing loafers lives in **House 2**.

The answer is (D) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in house 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

So, the arrangement looks like this:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: ?
- House 3: ?

From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in house 1, the only possible adjacent houses are houses 2 and 3. Therefore, the bird keeper and the history book buff must be in houses 2 and 3.

From Clue 2, the bird keeper cannot be in house 3. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in house 2, and the history book buff must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mystery book reader
- House 2: Bird keeper
- House 3: History book buff

Since the romance book lover does not live in the third house (Clue 3), the romance book lover must live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(B) 2**."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person eating apples lives directly left of the person drinking water.
3. The person eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in house 2.

From Clue 3, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 1 or house 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 6, the person eating kiwis cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or house 2 or house 4. Since the coffee drinker is in house 2, the kiwi eater must be in house 1 or house 4. But since the mangos eater is in house 4, the kiwi eater must be in house 1.

From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be to the left of the person drinking water. Since the mangos eater is in house 4 and the kiwi eater is in house 1, the apple eater must be in house 3 and the water drinker must be in house 4. However, this contradicts Clue 4, which states the mangos eater cannot be in house 3. Therefore, the apple eater must be in house 1 and the water drinker must be in house 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Mangos eater
- House 2: Coffee drinker
- House 3: Apple eater
- House 4: Water drinker

Thus, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"The person who is eating a banana lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) 1"
"The correct option is (C) 1.

To elaborate on the reasoning without referencing the previous response:

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. Clue 6 tells us the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the flutist must be in house 1 and the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2.
2. Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. So, the truck must be in house 3.
3. Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. Since the truck is in house 3, the gameboy must be in house 2.
4. Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 3.
5. Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person with the television must be in house 1 and the person with high heels must be in house 2.
6. Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

Therefore, the percussionist lives in house 1."

1. **Clue 6**: The person who is eating grapes lives in the fifth house (house 5).
2. **Clue 9**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house (house 2).
3. **Clue 10**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the pianist, so the pianist must be in house 3.
4. **Clue 13**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils (house 2) lives directly left of the person who has a television (house 3).
5. **Clue 8**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
6. **Clue 7**: The person who has a gameboy and the guitarist live directly next to each other.

9. **Clue 4**: The person who has a television lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.
10. **Clue 11**: The violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other.
11. **Clue 12**: The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the saxophonist.
12. **Clue 1**: The saxophonist lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a vase of tulips.

Let's place the remaining people:

"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
   - This means the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet.

2. **Clue 3**: The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the SUV lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

3. **Clue 4**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the root beer lover.
   - This means the root beer lover cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the root beer lover).

4. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a minivan.
   - This means the minivan driver cannot be in the third house (since the truck driver must be to the right of the minivan driver).

5. **Clue 2**: The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the coffee drinker.
   - This means the person with the rose bouquet lives in the first house, and the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

From Clue 3 and Clue 4, we know:
- The SUV driver is in the first house.
- The root beer lover is not in the third house.
- The truck driver is to the right of the root beer lover.
- The minivan driver is not in the third house.

Since the second house is occupied by the person with the lilies bouquet, and the first house is occupied by the person with the SUV, the third house must be occupied by the coffee drinker.

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"The person who drives a truck lives in house 3.

(A) 3"
"The person who owns a sedan lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Based on the clues provided, let's deduce the correct placement of each person:

1. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Gameboy

2. **Clue 5**: The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Red

3. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This means the person who likes white cannot be in House 3 (since there is no house to the left of House 3), and the person who likes white must be in House 1 or House 2. Since House 2 is already taken by the person who likes red, the person who likes white must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red

4. **Clue 1**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes red.
   - Since the person who likes red is in House 2, the person who is eating grapes must be in House 3.
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 2: Red
   - House 1: White

5. **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.
   - This means the person who is eating apples and the person who is wearing sandals must be in Houses 1 and 3 or Houses 2 and 4. Since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes, the person who is eating apples must be in House 1 and the person who is wearing sandals must be in House 2.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

6. **Clue 2**: The person who has a phone lives directly left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
   - The person who is wearing running shoes must be in House 2 (since House 3 is already taken by the person who is eating grapes), and the person who has a phone must be in House 1.
   - House 1: White
   - House 2: Red
   - House 3: Grapes
   - House 4: Sandals

7. **Clue 4**: The person who has a gameboy lives in the third house.
   - This is already confirmed as House 3.

8. **Clue 6**: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating grapes.
   - This is already confirmed as House 1.

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who is wearing boots must be in House 4.
- The person who has a television must be in House 4.
- The person who is wearing sandals must be in House 4.

Since the person who is wearing sandals is in House 4, the person who has a television must be in House 4.

"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The tea drinker and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The saxophonist and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the saxophonist and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who is eating grapes live directly next to each other.
   - This means the baseball player and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The saxophonist lives in the first house (house 1).
   - Therefore, the saxophonist is in house 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The romance book lover and the golfer live directly next to each other.
   - This means the romance book lover and the golfer are in houses 1 and 2.

From Clue 4, we know the saxophonist is in house 1. From Clue 5, the romance book lover and the golfer must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the saxophonist is in house 1, the golfer must be in house 2. This leaves house 1 for the baseball player and house 2 for the person eating grapes.

Now, combining Clue 1 and Clue 3:
- The tea drinker and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.
- The baseball player and the person eating grapes are in houses 1 and 2.

Since the person eating grapes is in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 1. This leaves house 2 for the baseball player.

So, the assignments are:
- House 1: Tea drinker, Baseball player
- House 2: Person eating grapes, Golfer

Since the person eating mangos is not mentioned in any clue, and the person eating grapes is in house 2, the person eating mangos must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

From Clue 10, the person who has a rose bouquet lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns a sedan. From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the cat lover.

- Rose bouquet (cannot be in second house) - Sedan (cannot be in second house)
- Minivan and convertible (next to each other) - Truck (cannot be in second house)

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes yellow lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.

From Clue 3, if Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) drives a truck. But if Person 1 (House 1) likes yellow, then Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes (Clue 1), which creates a contradiction because Person 1 (House 1) cannot eat grapes. Therefore, Person 2 (House 2) must like yellow.

Since Person 2 (House 2) likes yellow, Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck. From Clue 1, Person 1 (House 1) drives a truck, so Person 2 (House 2) eats grapes. From Clue 2, Person 1 (House 1) wears boots, and since Person 2 (House 2) is the mystery book reader, Person 1 (House 1) is the fantasy book enthusiast.

Therefore, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 1**.

3. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the right of the cricketer.
   - Since the violinist is in House 2, the cricketer and the cellist must be in Houses 1 and 3, respectively, with the cellist to the right of the cricketer.

"To answer this question, we need to compare the number of states in Ancient Greece with the number of states in the United States in 1900.

1. **Ancient Greece**: Ancient Greece is often considered to have had 13 city-states, which were independent city-states or poleis. These city-states included Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, and many others.

2. **United States in 1900**: In 1900, the United States had 45 states. This number includes the original 13 colonies that formed the United States, plus the additional states that joined the Union after the American Revolution and the Civil War.

Comparing these two numbers:
- Ancient Greece: 13 states
- United States in 1900: 45 states

Clearly, the number of states in the United States in 1900 was significantly larger than the number of states in Ancient Greece.

"During the pandemic, door-to-door advertising can indeed be considered inconsiderate. Here’s why:

1. **Health Risks**: Door-to-door canvassing involves close contact with individuals, which can increase the risk of spreading the virus, especially if the person being approached is at higher risk due to age or pre-existing health conditions.

2. **Social Distancing**: The practice of door-to-door canvassing often involves standing close to people's homes, which goes against the social distancing guidelines recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.

3. **Public Health Concerns**: During a pandemic, public health officials are urging people to stay at home and limit their interactions to reduce the spread of the virus. Door-to-door canvassing can be seen as a disruption to this effort.

4. **Privacy Concerns**: People may feel uncomfortable or annoyed by door-to-door canvassing, especially if they are already dealing with stress and anxiety related to the pandemic.

In comparing Japanese serfdom to English serfdom, it's important to note that the feudal systems in both countries were structured differently.

Therefore, Japanese serfdom did not have a higher status than English serfdom."
