"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 3**: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.
   - House 3: Person who is wearing high heels.

2. **Clue 11**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.
3. **Clue 12**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
4. **Clue 4**: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.
5. **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
6. **Clue 6**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
7. **Clue 7**: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
8. **Clue 8**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
9. **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
10. **Clue 1**: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
11. **Clue 10**: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.
12. **Clue 9**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.

From Clue 3, we know the person in the third house is wearing high heels. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the third house is house number 3.

Now, let's use Clue 11 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the root beer lover and the person who is eating mangos. Since the root beer lover lives to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating mangos lives next to the person who had pizza, we can infer the following:

- The root beer lover must be in house 1 or 2.
- The person who is eating mangos must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who had pizza must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be next to each other.

Given that the person in house 3 is wearing high heels, the person who is eating mangos and the person who had pizza must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person who is eating mangos lives to the right of the coffee drinker, and the person who had pizza lives to the left of the coffee drinker, the person who is eating mangos must be in house 3 and the person who had pizza must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement so far is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who had pizza
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Next, we use Clue 10 and Clue 12 to determine the positions of the coffee drinker and the person who is wearing running shoes. Since the coffee drinker lives to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes, and the person who is eating grapes lives to the right of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in house 4 and the person who is wearing running shoes must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement now is:
- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

Finally, we use Clue 6 and Clue 7 to determine the positions of the person who drives a truck and the person who owns an SUV. Since the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice, and the person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker, the person who drives a truck must be in house 1 and the person who owns an SUV must be in house 2.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Person who is wearing running shoes
- House 2: Person who owns an SUV
- House 3: Person who is eating mangos
- House 4: Person who is eating grapes

From this arrangement, we can see that the tea drinker must be in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **(C) 2**."
"The person who ate grilled cheese lives in house number 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5."
"The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (B) 2."
"Given the constraints, let's deduce the positions step by step:

1. The violinist lives in House 1.
2. The person who ate spaghetti lives in House 1.
3. The person who ate fried rice lives in House 3.
4. The person with a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.
5. The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person with a vase of tulips.
6. The person who has a vase of tulips and the person who has a phone live directly next to each other.
7. The person who has a radio lives one house away from the history book buff.
8. The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the percussionist.

From these, we can deduce:
- House 1: Violinist (since the violinist lives in the first house)
- House 3: Fried rice eater (since the person who ate fried rice lives in the third house)
- House 2: Vase of tulips and phone (since the vase of tulips and phone live next to each other)
- House 3: History book buff (since the history book buff lives to the right of the person with the vase of tulips)
- House 2: Vase of tulips and phone
- House 1: Violinist
- House 3: Fried rice eater
- House 4: Radio (since the radio lives one house away from the history book buff, and the history book buff is in House 3, the radio must be in House 4)

Therefore, the person with a vase of tulips lives in House 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

"Given the clues, let's break down the information:

1. The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.
2. The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.

From Clue 2, we know the person wearing boots lives in house 2. This means the person driving a truck must live in house 1 because the person driving a truck is the only other car type left.

From Clue 1, the person driving a convertible must live directly left of the history book buff. Since the person driving a truck is in house 1, the person driving a convertible must be in house 2. Therefore, the history book buff must be in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: Person driving a convertible (mystery book reader)
- House 2: Person wearing boots (history book buff)

This leaves the person wearing sandals to live in house 2.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 5**: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Golfer

2. **Clue 4**: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - House 3: Not swimmer

3. **Clue 1**: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - This means the romance book lover must live in House 2, and the swimmer lives in House 1 (but we already know the golfer lives in House 1, so this is a contradiction). Therefore, the swimmer must live in House 2, and the romance book lover must live in House 3.

   - House 1: Golfer
   - House 2: Romance book lover
   - House 3: Mystery book reader (since the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff)
   - House 4: History book buff

4. **Clue 2**: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - House 4: History book buff

5. **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - This is consistent with our previous findings.

Now, we have:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2: Romance book lover
- House 3: Mystery book reader
- House 4: History book buff

The only house left is House 4, and the only person left is the basketball player.

Therefore, the basketball player lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
The correct option is (B) 3.
"The person who has a computer lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The root beer lover lives in the third house.
2. The romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses.
3. The tea drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the third house.
5. The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.
6. The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.
7. The person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house.
8. The person who likes green lives in the second house.
9. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.

From Clue 5, the root beer lover lives in the third house. From Clue 6, the romance book lover and the history book buff are in adjacent houses. From Clue 9, the person who likes yellow lives in the fourth house. From Clue 7, the person who likes red lives in the third house, which is a contradiction since the root beer lover is already in the third house. Therefore, Clue 5 must be incorrect, and the root beer lover does not live in the third house.

From Clue 8, the mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house. From Clue 2, the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green. Since the person who likes green lives in the second house (Clue 9), the coffee drinker must live in the fourth house.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the characteristics of each person and their corresponding house numbers:

1. **The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.**
   - This means if the person with the radio is in house 1, the person who likes green must be in house 2.
   - If the person with the radio is in house 2, the person who likes green must be in house 1.

2. **The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.**
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.

3. **The fish enthusiast does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the fish enthusiast must live in house 2.

4. **The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.**
   - This means the person who had pizza must live in house 2.

From Clue 2, we know:
- The fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1.

From Clue 3, we know:
- The fish enthusiast lives in house 2.

From Clue 4, we know:
- The person who had pizza lives in house 2.

From Clue 1, we know:
- The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
  - Since the person who likes green lives in house 2 (from Clue 3), the person who has a radio must live in house 1 (since house 1 is directly left of house 2).

So, we have:
- House 1: Fantasy book enthusiast, person who likes green, and person who had pizza.
- House 2: Fish enthusiast, person who has a radio, and person who ate spaghetti.

Since the person who had pizza (in house 2) and the person who likes green (in house 2) are already determined, we need to assign the remaining characteristics:
- The person who has a radio (in house 1) must have a phone (since the radio is the only other device).
- The person who ate spaghetti (in house 2) must have a radio (since the radio is already taken by the person in house 1).
- The person who is a cat lover must be in house 1 (since the fish enthusiast is in house 2).

Therefore, the person who is a cat lover lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the cat lover lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."

From Clue 5"
"The bird keeper lives in House 1.

So, the correct answer is (D) 1."
"The soccer player lives in house 1. 

So, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a phone and the person who had pizza live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The cat lover lives in the third house.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives directly left of the person who had fried rice.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a gameboy.
7. **Clue 7:** There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who has a television lives.
8. **Clue 8:** The bird keeper lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.
10. **Clue 10:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
11. **Clue 11:** The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house.

From Clue 4 and Clue 5, we know the person who ate grilled cheese lives in the first house. Therefore, the person who had fried rice must live in the second house.

Now, let's use Clue 1 to place the person with the phone and the person with pizza. Since the grilled cheese person is in the first house and the fried rice person is in the second house, the phone and pizza person must be in the second and third houses, respectively, or the third and fourth houses, respectively. However, Clue 2 tells us the cat lover is in the third house, so the phone and pizza person must be in the second and fourth houses.

Let's place the cat lover in the third house:
- Third house: Cat lover
- Second house: Phone
- Fourth house: Pizza

Now, we need to place the person who owns horses, the person who has a gameboy, the bird keeper, the person who has a television, and the person who had stew. 

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses must be to the left of the person who has a gameboy. The person who has a television must be one house to the right of the bird keeper. The person who had stew must be to the right of the person who had spaghetti, and the person who had stew must be to the left of the person who had fried rice.

Let's place the person who has a television in the fourth house (since the grilled cheese person is in the first house and the fried rice person is in the second house):
- Fourth house: Television

Now, the person who has a gameboy must be to the left of the person who owns horses, and the person who has a television is in the fourth house. So, the person who owns horses must be in the fifth house, and the person who has a gameboy must be in the third house.

The bird keeper must be to the left of the person who has a television, so the bird keeper must be in the second house:
- Second house: Bird keeper

The person who had stew must be to the right of the person who had spaghetti, and the person who had stew must be to the left of the person who had fried rice. Since the grilled cheese person is in the first house and the fried rice person is in the second house, the person who had stew must be in the fourth house, and the person who had spaghetti must be in the third house.

So, the arrangement is:
- First house: Grilled cheese
- Second house: Bird keeper
- Third house: Cat lover
- Fourth house: Television
- Fifth house: Gameboy

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Pianist does not live in the first house.**
2. **Person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person eating kiwis.**
3. **Pianist and person wearing high heels live directly next to each other.**
4. **Person wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.**
5. **Person eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person wearing boots.**
6. **Person wearing high heels and the person with a radio live directly next to each other.**
7. **Person eating oranges lives directly left of the person with a television.**

Let's start by placing the pianist and the person wearing high heels next to each other. Since the pianist cannot be in house 1, let's try placing the pianist in house 2 and the person wearing high heels in house 3.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Next, we need to place the person eating oranges and the person eating kiwis next to each other, and the person eating kiwis must be to the left of the person wearing boots.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Now, we need to place the person wearing running shoes and the percussionist next to each other, and the person wearing high heels and the person with a radio next to each other.

- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

Finally, we need to place the person eating oranges directly left of the person with a television.

- **House 1**: Pianist (P)
- **House 2**: Person wearing high heels (H)
- **House 3**: Percussionist (Perc)
- **House 4**: Person eating oranges (O)
- **House 5**: Person eating kiwis (K)
- **House 6**: Person wearing boots (B)
- **House 7**: Person with a radio (R)
- **House 8**: Person with a television (T)

All clues are satisfied with this arrangement. Therefore, the person with a television lives in house 8.

The correct answer is (A) 8."

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 5."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes milk lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.
6. **Clue 6:** There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who only drinks water lives.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the second house.
8. **Clue 8:** The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who ate spaghetti does not live in the first house.

Let's start by placing the person who is wearing running shoes in the second house (Clue 7).

- House 2: Running shoes

Next, we place the person who likes milk in the third house (Clue 4).

- House 3: Milk drinker

Now, the person who is wearing running shoes (House 2) and the person who likes milk (House 3) are placed. We need to place the root beer lover and the person who ate fried rice next to each other (Clue 1).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Next, we place the person who is wearing loafers and the person who ate grilled cheese next to each other (Clue 2).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining houses are 1, 2, 3, and 4. We need to place the person who drives a convertible and the person who only drinks water next to each other (Clue 8).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Since the person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), we can place them as follows:

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Running shoes
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The only remaining house is 2, and it must be the person who drives a convertible, and the house to the left of it must be the person who only drinks water.

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, we need to place the person who is wearing high heels and the person who owns an SUV (Clue 3 and Clue 5).

- House 1: Root beer lover
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house (Clue 3), so the only remaining house for the high heels wearer is House 1.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: Milk drinker
- House 4: Fried rice eater

The person who owns an SUV must live directly left of the person who only drinks water (Clue 8), and the only remaining house for the SUV owner is House 3.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Convertible driver
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Finally, the only remaining house for the person who only drinks water is House 2.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Fried rice eater

Thus, the person who owns a sedan must live in the remaining house, which is House 4.

- House 1: High heels wearer
- House 2: Only drinks water
- House 3: SUV owner
- House 4: Sedan owner

Therefore, the person who owns a sedan lives in House 4.

The correct answer is (C) 4."
"Based on the clues provided, we can deduce the following:

1. The tea drinker lives in house 4.
2. The saxophonist lives in house 2.
3. The pizza eater lives in house 3 (since they are to the right of the saxophonist).
4. The cellist lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
5. The person who only drinks water lives directly left of the person who is wearing loafers.
6. The cellist lives directly left of the tea drinker, so the cellist must be in house 3.
7. The person who is wearing sandals lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
8. The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.
9. The flutist does not live in the fourth house.
10. The tea drinker lives in the fourth house.

From the above, we can conclude that the cellist lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(C) 3"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of each person step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.
3. **Clue 3:** The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.
6. **Clue 6:** The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
7. **Clue 7:** The swimmer does not live in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.
9. **Clue 9:** The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.
10. **Clue 10:** The root beer lover lives in the third house.

From Clue 9, we know the minivan driver lives in house 4. From Clue 10, the root beer lover lives in house 3. 

From Clue 8, the basketball player lives directly left of the truck driver, so the truck driver must be in house 2 and the basketball player in house 1.

From Clue 3, the swimmer lives directly left of the sedan owner. Since the swimmer is in house 1, the sedan owner must be in house 2. But house 2 is already occupied by the truck driver, so the sedan owner must be in house 3.

From Clue 5, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player. Since the basketball player is in house 1, the bouquet of lilies must be in house 3 or 4. But house 3 is already occupied by the sedan owner, so the bouquet of lilies must be in house 4.

From Clue 2, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other. Since the bouquet of lilies is in house 4, the bouquet of daffodils must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker and the tennis player live one house apart. The only remaining houses are 1 and 2, but house 2 is already occupied by the truck driver. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be in house 1 and the tennis player in house 2.

From Clue 4, the person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement. Since the truck driver is in house 2, the person with carnations must be in house 1.

Thus, the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **(A) 1**."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. The tea drinker lives in the first house (Clue 1).
2. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the person driving a minivan (Clue 2).
3. The person driving a convertible lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 3).
4. There is one house between where the fantasy book enthusiast lives and where the coffee drinker lives (Clue 4).
5. The person eating oranges does not live in the second house (Clue 5).

Let's analyze:

- Since the tea drinker is in house 1, the person eating apples must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person driving a minivan must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person driving a convertible must be in house 2 or 3.
- The person eating oranges cannot be in house 2, so they must be in house 1 or 3.
- The fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3.

Given Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast and the coffee drinker must be in houses 2 and 3. Since the person eating oranges cannot be in house 2, they must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the person eating oranges, the person driving a minivan, and the person driving a convertible.

Since the person driving a convertible must be to the right of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 3), and the person driving a minivan must be to the right of the person eating oranges (Clue 2), the only logical placement is:
- House 1: Person eating oranges
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast
- House 3: Coffee drinker

Therefore, the coffee drinker lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means if the person who likes red is in house 1, the mystery book reader must be in house 2.
   - If the person who likes red is in house 2, the mystery book reader must be in house 3.

2. **Clue 2:** The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - This means the fantasy book enthusiast must live in either house 2 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who likes white must live in either house 1 or house 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes red lives in the second house.
   - This means the person who likes red lives in house 2.

Given Clue 4, the person who likes red lives in house 2. According to Clue 1, the person who likes red lives directly left of the mystery book reader. Therefore, the mystery book reader must live in house 3.

Now, we know:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

Since the person who likes white cannot live in house 3 (Clue 3), the person who likes white must live in house 1.

So, we have:
- House 1: The person who likes white
- House 2: The person who likes red
- House 3: The mystery book reader

This leaves the fantasy book enthusiast to live in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**.

The answer is (A) 3."
"The person who owns an SUV lives in house number 3.

(A) 3"
"The root beer lover lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"The science fiction book fanatic lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) 4"
"The person who is wearing sandals lives in the second house (number 2). 

So, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The violinist lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house 5.

So, the correct answer is (E) 5."
"The person who has a computer lives in house 2.

So, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic (SFF) lives somewhere to the left of the golfer (Golfer).
   - This means SFF is in House 1 and Golfer is in House 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who had pizza (PE) and the history book buff (HBB) live directly next to each other.
   - This means PE and HBB must be in adjacent houses. Since Golfer is in House 2, PE and HBB must be in House 1 and House 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The guitarist (G) lives somewhere to the right of the person with a bouquet of daffodils (D).
   - This means G and D must be in adjacent houses, and G must be to the right of D. Since Golfer is in House 2, G and D must be in House 1 and House 2.

Given these constraints, let's try to fit the remaining characteristics:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff), G (golfer), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)

Since the golfer is in House 2, and the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2, this arrangement is not possible because the golfer cannot be in House 2 if the person with the bouquet of daffodils is also in House 2.

Therefore, the only feasible arrangement is:

- **House 1:** SFF (science fiction book fanatic), PE (pizza-eater), D (person with bouquet of daffodils)
- **House 2:** Golfer (G), HBB (history book buff)

Given this arrangement, the percussionist (Perc) must be in House 1 because the guitarist (G) and the person with the bouquet of daffodils (D) are in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the percussionist lives is **1**.

Final answer: (B) 1"
"Given the constraints and the process of elimination, let's summarize the information we have:

1. The violinist lives in house 4.
2. The bird keeper lives in house 5.
3. The dog owner does not live in house 2.
4. The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live next to each other.
5. The flutist lives next to the person who has a television.
6. The guitarist is to the right of the percussionist.
7. The television and gameboy are neighbors.
8. The television is to the left of the radio.
9. The person who has a phone lives two houses away from the person who owns horses.

Let's place the known elements first:

- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Phone
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

Now, we need to place the remaining people and devices:

- The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses are neighbors.
- The flutist lives next to the person who has a television.
- The television is to the left of the radio.
- The guitarist is to the right of the percussionist.

Let's try to place the remaining people and devices:

- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Phone
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

Since the television is to the left of the radio, the radio must be in house 5 (but the bird keeper is already in house 5), so the radio must be in house 4, making the television in house 3.

- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Phone
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

The flutist lives next to the person who has a television, so the flutist must be in house 2.

- House 1: Dog owner
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses are neighbors, so they must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. Since the flutist is in house 2, the fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses must be in houses 1 and 3.

- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

The guitarist is to the right of the percussionist, so the percussionist must be in house 1 and the guitarist in house 2 (but the flutist is already in house 2), so the percussionist must be in house 1 and the guitarist in house 3.

- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Violinist
- House 5: Bird keeper

This leaves the cat lover and the person who has a gameboy. The gameboy and television are neighbors, so the gameboy must be in house 4.

- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Gameboy
- House 5: Bird keeper

The cat lover must be in house 5.

- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Flutist
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Gameboy
- House 5: Cat lover

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 1.

The answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 3:** The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Lilies

2. **Clue 4:** The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Therefore, the basketball player must live in house 2.

3. **Clue 1 and Clue 2:** The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples and also to the right of the violinist.
   - This means the person eating apples must be to the left of the violinist.
   - Since the basketball player (who is not eating apples) lives in house 2, the person eating apples must be in house 1.
   - Therefore, the violinist must be in house 2.

Thus, the violinist lives in house 2.

The correct answer is **(B) 2**."
"The cricketer lives in the 2nd house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 2."
"The person who is wearing loafers lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is **(A) 2**."
"The root beer lover lives in house number 3.

(C) 3"
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater

2. The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - House 1: Spaghetti eater
   - House 2: Not loafers
   - House 3: Possible loafers

3. The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.
   - House 2: Not fried rice eater
   - House 3: Fried rice eater

4. The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 3, the boots wearer must be in House 2.
   - If the fried rice eater is in House 1, the boots wearer must be in House 2 (but this is not possible since the fried rice eater cannot be in House 2).

From Clue 4, we can conclude:
- Fried rice eater is in House 3
- Boots wearer is in House 2

Since the person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house (House 1) and the person who is wearing loafers cannot be in the second house (House 2), the only remaining house is House 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing loafers lives in House 3.

The correct answer is (C) 3."

"The person who had pizza lives in House 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"The person eating mangos lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 1."
"The person who likes white lives in house number 3.

So, the correct option is (A) 3."
"The person who has a rose bouquet lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is (A) 2."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics:

1. The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.
2. The person who likes yellow lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes milk.
3. The root beer lover lives in the second house.
4. The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who only drinks water.
5. The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.

From clue 5, we know the third house is occupied by the person who likes yellow. From clue 3, the second house is occupied by the person who likes root beer. From clue 1, the person who likes blue must be in a house number greater than 3. From clue 2, the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3. From clue 4, the person who likes white must be in a house number greater than the house number of the person who only drinks water.

Given these constraints, let's place the people in the houses:
- House 1: Only drinks water (let's call this person ""W"")
- House 2: Likes root beer (let's call this person ""R"")
- House 3: Likes yellow (let's call this person ""Y"")
- House 4: Likes blue (let's call this person ""B"")

Since the person who likes blue (B) must be in a house number greater than 3, and the person who likes milk must be in a house number greater than 3, the only possible house for the person who likes blue is House 4.

Thus, the person who likes blue lives in the fourth house.

The correct answer is (B) 4."
"The bird keeper lives in house 3.

So, the correct answer is (B) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement of each person in the houses:

1. **Clue 2:** The person who owns horses lives in the first house.
2. **Clue 10:** The dog owner lives in the fourth house.
3. **Clue 12:** The coffee drinker lives in the fifth house.
4. **Clue 13:** The cricketer lives in the fourth house.
5. **Clue 14:** The tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper.
6. **Clue 17:** The cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker (which is in the fifth house).
7. **Clue 16:** The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
8. **Clue 18:** The person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice.

From Clue 2, the first house is occupied by the person who owns horses.

From Clue 10, the fourth house is occupied by the dog owner.

From Clue 12, the fifth house is occupied by the coffee drinker.

From Clue 13, the fourth house is occupied by the cricketer.

From Clue 14, the tennis player lives directly left of the bird keeper. Since the cricketer is in the fourth house, the bird keeper must be in the third house, and the tennis player must be in the second house.

From Clue 17, the cellist lives directly left of the coffee drinker. Since the coffee drinker is in the fifth house, the cellist must be in the fourth house, but the fourth house is already occupied by the cricketer. This means the cellist must be in the third house.

From Clue 16, the root beer lover lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the root beer lover is in the first house, the person who likes milk must be in the second house.

From Clue 18, the person who had stew lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate fried rice. Since the root beer lover is in the first house, the person who ate fried rice must be in the third house, and the person who had stew must be in the fourth house.

From Clue 4, the flutist lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti. Since the person who ate spaghetti is in the first house, the flutist must be in the second house.

From Clue 9, the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in the first house, the fried rice person (in the third house) is to the right of the tea drinker.

From Clue 5, there is one house between where the pianist lives and where the bird keeper lives. Since the bird keeper is in the third house, the pianist must be in the second house, but the second house is already occupied by the root beer lover. This means the pianist must be in the fourth house, but the fourth house is already occupied by the cricketer.

   - The third house is occupied by the person with a gameboy, so the convertible cannot be in house 3.

6. **Clue 6:** The person who has a computer does not live in the first house.
   - The first house is occupied by the person with a minivan, so the computer cannot be in house 1.

From the above, we know:
- House 1: Minivan
- House 3: Gameboy
- House 4: Radio

Since the person with a phone must be adjacent to the person with an SUV and the phone must be to the left of the SUV, the only possible arrangement is:
- House 2: Phone
- House 4: SUV

Therefore, the person who owns an SUV lives in house 4.

The correct answer is (A) 4."
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house number 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 4."
"The dog owner lives in House 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 3."

6. The person who owns an SUV lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers (Clue 11), so the SUV owner must live in the fourth house.
7. The person who only drinks water lives in the second house (Clue 2).
8. The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker (Clue 9).
9. The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner (Clue 10), and since the dog owner is in the third house, the person who is wearing high heels must be in the first house.
10. The fish enthusiast lives in the first house (Clue 13).
11. The person who owns horses lives in the fourth house (Clue 5).

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the person who likes red lives in the second house.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is (C) 2."

"Given the clues:

1. The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. The person who ate pizza and the person who ate fried rice have different characteristics (one is a science fiction book fanatic and one is a history book buff).

From the first clue, if the person who ate fried rice is in house 2, then the science fiction book fanatic must be in house 1. This is because the fried rice eater is to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Therefore, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is (B) 1."
"The dog owner lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 7**: The person who had pizza lives in the fourth house.
   - House 4: Pizza eater

2. **Clue 6**: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the percussionist.
   - This means the history book buff cannot be in the first house, and the percussionist cannot be in the fourth house.

3. **Clue 5**: There are two houses between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the fantasy book enthusiast lives.
   - This means the person who ate fried rice and the fantasy book enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2, or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 2**: The person who had stew lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Stew eater

5. **Clue 4**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

6. **Clue 1**: The percussionist lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - This means the percussionist cannot be in the first house, and the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

7. **Clue 3**: The guitarist lives somewhere to the left of the violinist.
   - This means the guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:
- House 4: Pizza eater
- House 2: Stew eater
- The guitarist and violinist cannot be in houses 4 and 1, respectively.
- The percussionist and science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the guitarist and violinist are:
- Guitarist in house 1
- Violinist in house 3

This leaves the following possibilities for the remaining houses:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 3: Violinist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 4: Pizza eater

Now, we need to place the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic:
- The history book buff must be to the right of the percussionist.
- The science fiction book fanatic cannot be in the fourth house.

The only possible positions for the history book buff and the science fiction book fanatic are:
- History book buff in house 3 (but house 3 is taken by the violinist)
- Science fiction book fanatic in house 1 (but house 1 is taken by the guitarist)

This leaves house 4 for the science fiction book fanatic and house 3 for the history book buff.

So, the final arrangement is:
- House 1: Guitarist
- House 2: Stew eater
- House 3: History book buff
- House 4: Pizza eater

Therefore, the percussionist must be in house 4.

The number of the house where the percussionist lives is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"The person who owns horses lives in House 3.

(C) 3"
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk.
2. The person who is eating mangos lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.
3. The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.
4. The person who is eating apples lives in the third house.

From Clue 4, we know the person eating apples lives in the third house. So, the arrangement looks like this:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: ?
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 2, the person eating mangos must live directly left of the person eating apples. Since the person eating apples is in the third house, the person eating mangos must be in the second house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: ?
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 1, the coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who likes milk. Since the person eating mangos is in the second house, the coffee drinker must be in the first house. So, the arrangement now is:

- House 1: Coffee drinker
- House 2: Person eating mangos
- House 3: Person eating apples

From Clue 3, the coffee drinker does not live in the second house. This is consistent with our current arrangement. Now, the only person left is the one who likes milk. Since the coffee drinker is in the first house and the person eating mangos is in the second house, the person who likes milk must be in the third house.

Therefore, the person who likes milk lives in the third house.

The correct answer is (C) 3."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The science fiction book fanatic lives in the second house.
   - House 2: Science fiction book fanatic

2. **Clue 2:** The person who is wearing loafers and the person who likes red live directly next to each other.
   - This means the person wearing loafers and the person who likes red must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who likes white and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in houses 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
   - House 1: Carnations arrangement

5. **Clue 5:** The person who is wearing boots does not live in the third house.
   - This means the person who is wearing boots must live in either house 1 or house 2.

6. **Clue 6:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.
   - This means the person who has a vase of tulips must be in a house to the left of the person who has the history book.

7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.
   - This means the person who likes red must be in a house to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 2 and Clue 3, the person who likes red and the person who is wearing loafers must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the person who likes red must be to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips (Clue 6), the person who likes red must be in house 2 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1. This contradicts Clue 4, which states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1. Therefore, the person who likes red must be in house 1 and the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 2.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations arrangement (Clue 4)
- House 2: Science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1)
- House 3: Unknown

Now, we need to place the remaining characteristics:
- The person who likes white must be in house 3 (Clue 3).
- The person who is wearing loafers must be in house 1 (Clue 2).
- The person who likes red must be in house 2 (Clue 6).

This leaves the person who is wearing boots to be in house 3.

Therefore, the person who is wearing boots lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. The person who only drinks water lives in the first house.
2. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in the second house.
3. There is one house between where the person who only drinks water lives and where the person who likes milk lives.
4. The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

From Clue 1, the person who only drinks water lives in house 1. From Clue 4, the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2. This means the person who likes milk must be in house 3 because there is one house between house 1 and house 3. 

From Clue 3, the person who has a bouquet of lilies (in house 2) lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a bouquet of lilies is in house 2, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 1 or house 3. But house 1 is already occupied by the person who only drinks water. Therefore, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in house 3. This leaves house 1 for the person who has a rose bouquet.

So, the person who has a rose bouquet lives in house number 1.

5. **Clue 5:** The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the romance book lover.

From Clue 4, we know the person who likes yellow lives in house 1.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses, and since the romance book lover is in house 1, the history book buff must be in house 2.

From Clue 3, the person who had pizza cannot be in house 1, so they must be in either house 2 or house 3. Since the romance book lover is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2, the person who had pizza must be in house 3.

From Clue 1, the person who likes green must be in house 2, but we already know the romance book lover is in house 1 and the history book buff is in house 2. This means the person who likes green must be in house 3.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Romance book lover
- House 2: Green
- House 3: History book buff

From Clue 4, the percussionist lives directly left of the romance book lover. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the percussionist must be in the third house, and the romance book lover must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between where the history book buff lives and where the guitarist lives. Since the saxophonist is in the fourth house, the guitarist must be in the fifth house.

From Clue 3, there is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the mystery book reader lives. Since the percussionist is in the third house and the mystery book reader is in the fourth house, this clue is consistent.

From Clue 1, the romance book lover (in the second house) lives somewhere to the left of the fantasy book enthusiast. Since the romance book lover is in the second house, the fantasy book enthusiast must be in the fifth house.

Thus, the violinist lives in the third house.

The number of the house where the violinist lives is \(\boxed{3}\)."

2. **Clue 5**: The coffee drinker lives in the fourth house (House 4).
3. **Clue 16**: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a television. Since the coffee drinker is in House 4, the person with a television must be in House 5.
4. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given Clue 15, the person with a radio is in House 1, and the person with a computer cannot be in House 3 (Clue 9), so the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in Houses 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Since the coffee drinker is in House 4, the swimmer and the person who only drinks water must be in Houses 2 and 3.
5. **Clue 14**: The basketball player lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the basketball player and the person who only drinks water must be in adjacent houses. Given the possible placements, the only valid pair is (2, 3).

Since the person who only drinks water is in House 3, the person who likes green must be in House 2, and the person who has a phone must be in House 3.
15. **Clue 2**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the right of the person who drives a convertible. This means the person who likes green must be in House 3, and the person who drives a convertible must be in House 1.
16. **Clue 3**: The person who only drinks water does not live in the third house. This means the person who only drinks water must be in House 2 or 5. Given Clue 17, the swimmer must be in House 2, and the person who only drinks water must be in House 3.
17. **Clue 17**: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who only drinks water. This means the swimmer must be in House 2, and the person who only drinks water must be in House 3.

From the above deductions, the coffee drinker lives in House 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is **4**.

The correct answer is (E) 4."
"Given the clues, let's analyze the placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. This means the tulip person can only live in houses 1 or 2.
2. **Clue 2:** The person who owns an SUV lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies. This means the SUV person and the lilies person are neighbors, and the lilies person is to the left of the SUV person.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan and the person who has a rose bouquet live directly next to each other.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet does not live in the second house. This means the rose bouquet person can only be in house 1 or 3.

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 2:
  - The sedan person must live in house 1 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 2).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 1).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 1:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 3 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 1).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

- If the rose bouquet person lives in house 3:
  - The sedan person must live in house 2 (since they are neighbors).
  - The lilies person must live in house 1 (since the SUV person must be to the right of the lilies person and the rose bouquet person is in house 3).
  - The tulip person must live in house 2 (since the tulip person cannot be in house 3 and the sedan person is in house 2).

This configuration does not work because the sedan person and the rose bouquet person are neighbors, but the tulip person cannot be in house 2.

The only valid configuration is:
- Rose bouquet person in house 1.
- Sedan person in house 2.
- Lilies person in house 3.
- Tulip person in house 2.

Thus, the person who drives a truck must live in house 3.

The answer is (C) 3."
"Given the constraints and the refined approach, let's deduce the correct house for the person who likes milk.

1. **House 4: Lilies**
2. **House 5: Tulips**
3. **House 3: Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
4. **House 2: Not Science Fiction Book Fanatic**
5. **House 1: Fantasy Book Enthusiast or Root Beer Lover**
6. **House 3: History Book Buff**
7. **House 4: Cellist**
8. **House 5: Violinist**
9. **House 3: Pianist or Mystery Book Reader**
10. **House 4: Carnations Arrangement**
11. **House 5: Rose Bouquet**
12. **House 3: Rose Bouquet and Milk**
13. **House 4: Carnations Arrangement and Milk**
14. **House 3: Cellist**
15. **House 4: Daffodils**

From the above deductions, the person who likes milk must live in House 4, as the person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other, and the carnations arrangement is in House 4.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who likes milk lives is **4**.

The correct answer is (D) 4."
"The basketball player lives in the second house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 2."
"The person who likes blue lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct placement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live directly next to each other.
2. **Clue 2:** There is one house between where the percussionist lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.
3. **Clue 3:** The person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who likes yellow lives in the third house.
5. **Clue 5:** There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a rose bouquet lives.
6. **Clue 6:** The person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live directly next to each other.
7. **Clue 7:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.
8. **Clue 8:** The cellist does not live in the third house.

From Clue 7, we know the first house has a carnations arrangement. So, the first house is occupied by the person with carnations.

From Clue 4, the third house has the person who likes yellow.

From Clue 1, the person who has a vase of tulips and the bird keeper live next to each other. This means the bird keeper cannot be in the first or third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

From Clue 2, there is one house between the percussionist and the person who drives a truck. This means the percussionist and the person who drives a truck must be in houses 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2).

From Clue 3, the person who owns a sedan lives directly left of the fish enthusiast. This means the sedan and the fish enthusiast must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 5, there is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a rose bouquet. This means the horses and the rose bouquet must be in houses 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1).

From Clue 6, the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue live next to each other. This means the horses and the person who likes blue must be in houses 1 and 2 (or 2 and 1).

From Clue 8, the cellist does not live in the third house. This means the cellist must be in houses 1, 2, or 4.

Given the constraints, let's place the cellist in the second house (since the cellist cannot be in the third house):
- Second house: Cellist
- First house: Sedan (next to the fish enthusiast)
- Third house: Yellow (person who likes yellow)
- Fourth house: Horses (next to the person who likes blue)

This leaves the third house for the person who owns horses and the person who likes blue. Since the cellist is in the second house, the person who owns horses must be in the fourth house and the person who likes blue must be in the first house.

So, the bird keeper must be in the second house.

Therefore, the bird keeper lives in the second house. The answer is (B) 2."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1).
2. The cellist lives in the first house (number 1).
3. The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red.

From clue 1, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in house 1. From clue 2, the cellist also lives in house 1. This creates a contradiction because only one person can live in each house. Therefore, we need to reassess.

Given that the fantasy book enthusiast and the cellist cannot both live in the first house, let's consider the possibility that the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (number 1) and the cellist lives in the second house (number 2).

Now, using clue 3: the person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red. Since the first house (number 1) is occupied by the fantasy book enthusiast, the person who likes green must live in the second house (number 2), and the person who likes red must live in the first house (number 1).

This means:
- The fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green.
- The person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red.
- The cellist (living in house 2) plays the cello.
- The pianist (living in house 1) plays the piano.

Now, we need to determine the mystery book reader. Since the fantasy book enthusiast (living in house 1) likes green and the person who likes green (living in house 2) likes red, the mystery book reader must live in house 2.

Therefore, the mystery book reader lives in house 2.

The correct answer is (B) 2."

2. **Clue 5:** The mystery book reader lives somewhere to the right of the person who had stew.
3. **Clue 6:** The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating apples.

11. **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
12. **Clue 17:** The science fiction book fanatic lives directly left of the person who is eating apples.

- **Clue 16:** The person who is wearing high heels lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate grilled cheese.

"The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives in house 2.

So, the correct option is:
(B) 2"
"Given the clues, let's deduce the positions of the people and their characteristics step by step:

1. **Carnations arrangement in the fourth house**: House 4.
2. **Rose bouquet in the third house**: House 3.
3. **Fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer**: This means if the swimmer is in house \(i\), the fantasy book enthusiast is in house \(i-1\).
4. **Tennis player lives somewhere to the right of the mystery book reader**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the tennis player is in house \(i+1\) or later.
5. **There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet**: This means if the rose bouquet is in house \(i\), the daffodils are in house \(i+1\) or \(i-1\).
6. **There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover**: This means if the mystery book reader is in house \(i\), the romance book lover is in house \(i+2\) or \(i-2\).

### Analyzing the Clues:
- **Clue 6**: Rose bouquet in house 3.
- **Clue 4**: Fantasy book enthusiast in house 2 (since the fantasy book enthusiast lives directly left of the swimmer).

- **Clue 8**: There is one house between the person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a rose bouquet.
- **Clue 9**: There are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover.

### Placing the People:
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player (since the tennis player does not live in house 4, and the only available house is house 4).
- House 1: Mystery book reader (since there are two houses between the mystery book reader and the romance book lover, and the only possible positions are houses 1 and 3, but house 3 is already taken by the rose bouquet, so the mystery book reader must be in house 1).
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast (since the golfer lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils, and the only available house is house 5).

### Final Placement:
- House 1: Mystery book reader.
- House 2: Fantasy book enthusiast.
- House 3: Rose bouquet.
- House 4: Tennis player.
- House 5: Golf book enthusiast.

### Conclusion:
The romance book lover must be in house 2, as there are two houses between the mystery book reader (house 1) and the romance book lover.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions we can make from the clues, let's piece together the arrangement:

1. **Coffee drinker lives in the third house.**
   - House 3: Coffee drinker.

2. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the coffee drinker is in House 3, the computer and gameboy cannot be in House 3. So, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 4), (House 4, House 5).

3. **The saxophonist does not live in the second house.**
   - Possible houses for saxophonist: 1, 3, 4, 5.

   - Possible houses for gameboy: 1, 3, 4, 5.

6. **The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a computer.**
   - If the computer is in House 4, the gameboy must be in House 3 (but the coffee drinker is in House 3). So, the computer must be in House 5 and the gameboy in House 4.

7. **The person who has a computer lives somewhere to the right of the cellist.**
   - Computer in House 5, so cellist must be in House 4.

8. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives directly left of the percussionist.**
   - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
   - Since the computer is in House 5, the percussionist must be in House 4 (but cellist is in House 4). So, the carnations arrangement must be in House 3 and the percussionist in House 5.

9. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
   - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

13. **The person who has a phone and the person who has a vase of tulips live directly next to each other.**
    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3), (House 3, House 4), (House 4, House 5).
    - Since the saxophonist is not in House 2 and the water drinker is not in House 4, the possible pairs are (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

14. **The person who only drinks water does not live in the fourth house.**
    - Possible houses for water drinker: 1, 2, 3, 5.

    - Possible pairs: (House 1, House 2), (House 2, House 3).

16. **The person who has a phone lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.**

"The person who likes white lives in house 2. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 2."
The number of the house where the basketball player lives is (A) 1.
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in house 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 1."
"The person who drives a minivan lives in house number 1.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"The person who has a vase of tulips lives in House 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"The dog owner lives in house 3.

So, the correct answer is (B) 3."
"The person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house 1.

So, the correct option is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the correct house where the person who had pizza lives:

1. **Carnations in House 1.**
2. **Apples in House 2.**
3. **Banana not between pianist and pizza.**
4. **Pianoist not in House 5.**
5. **Guitarist not in House 3.**
6. **Pizza to the right of Saxophonist.**
7. **Stew and Grilled Cheese next to each other.**
8. **Mango not in House 4.**
9. **Tulips not in House 3.**
10. **Daffodils to the left of Roses.**
11. **Banana between Pianoist and Pizza.**
12. **Pizza not in House 5.**

From Clue 11, the banana must be between the pianist and the pizza. Given Clue 12, the pianoist cannot be in House 5, and the pizza cannot be in House 5. Let's place the pianoist and the pizza in the remaining houses.

- If the pianoist is in House 4, the pizza must be in House 5 (since pizza must be to the right of the pianoist and cannot be in House 5).
- But Clue 12 states the pizza must be to the right of the saxophonist, and Clue 15 states the pizza cannot be in House 5. Therefore, the pianoist cannot be in House 4.

Let's try the pianoist in House 3:
- If the pianoist is in House 3, the pizza must be in House 4 (since pizza must be to the right of the pianoist and cannot be in House 5).

Now, let's place the remaining items:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Apples
- House 3: Pianoist
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Not used (since pizza is in House 4)

From Clue 10, the daffodils must be to the left of the roses. Since the pianoist is in House 3, the roses must be in House 4 (since the pizza is in House 4 and roses must be to the left of daffodils).

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Carnations
- House 2: Apples
- House 3: Pianoist
- House 4: Pizza
- House 5: Not used

Therefore, the person who had pizza lives in House 4.

The answer is (D) 4."

"The correct option is (A) 3.

To elaborate on the reasoning without referencing the previous response:

Given the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. The pianist and the person eating kiwis are next to each other.
2. The flutist is to the right of the violinist.
3. There is one house between the person eating grapes and the person eating kiwis.
4. There is one house between the violinist and the person eating kiwis.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

- If the person eating kiwis is in house 1, the violinist must be in house 3 (Clue 4). This would place the flutist in house 2 (Clue 2), and the person eating grapes in house 3, which is a contradiction because house 3 is already occupied by the violinist.
- If the person eating kiwis is in house 2, the violinist must be in house 1 (Clue 4). This would place the flutist in house 3 (Clue 2), and the person eating grapes in house 1, which is a contradiction because house 1 is already occupied by the violinist.

Therefore, the only consistent configuration is:
- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 1 (Clue 3), but house 1 is already occupied by the violinist, which is a contradiction.

Revisiting the correct configuration:
- Person eating kiwis in house 2.
- Violinist in house 1.
- Flutist in house 3.
- Person eating grapes in house 3 (Clue 3), which is consistent.

Thus, the pianist must be in house 3.

The answer is (A) 3."

"Given the clues:

1. The root beer lover does not live in the second house.
2. The pianist lives directly left of the cellist.

Since the houses are numbered 1 and 2, and the root beer lover cannot be in house 2, the root beer lover must be in house 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the root beer lover lives is (A) 1."
"The person who has the bouquet of lilies lives in the fourth house. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 4."

"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The fantasy book enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the science fiction book fanatic.
2. **Clue 2:** The romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.
3. **Clue 3:** The romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips.
4. **Clue 4:** The person who has a rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other.
5. **Clue 5:** The person who has a rose bouquet lives in the second house.

From Clue 5, we know the person with the rose bouquet lives in house number 2. Let's denote the houses as 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Since the person with the rose bouquet and the science fiction book fanatic live directly next to each other (Clue 4), the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 1 or 3. However, since the fantasy book enthusiast lives to the left of the science fiction book fanatic (Clue 1), the science fiction book fanatic cannot be in house number 1. Therefore, the science fiction book fanatic must be in house number 3.

Now, the person with the rose bouquet is in house number 2, and the science fiction book fanatic is in house number 3. This leaves houses 1 and 4 for the remaining two people.

From Clue 2, the romance book lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement. From Clue 3, the romance book lover lives directly left of the person who has a vase of tulips. This means the person with the carnations arrangement must be in house number 1, and the person with the vase of tulips must be in house number 4. The romance book lover must be in house number 1 or 4. Since the person with the carnations arrangement is in house number 1, the romance book lover must be in house number 4.

So, the arrangement is:
- House 1: Person with carnations arrangement
- House 2: Person with rose bouquet
- House 3: Science fiction book fanatic
- House 4: Person with vase of tulips

The only house left is house number 4, where the person with the vase of tulips lives. The person with the vase of tulips cannot be the person with the lilies, as the person with the lilies must be the only one left. Since the person with the vase of tulips is in house number 4, the person with the lilies must be in house number 1.

Therefore, the person with the bouquet of lilies lives in house number 1.

The correct answer is (A) 1."

3. **Clue 3:** The person who is eating kiwis lives in the second house.
   - This means the person eating kiwis is in house 2.

From Clue 3, we know the person eating kiwis is in house 2. From Clue 2, the person wearing sandals must be in house 1 (since the person eating kiwis is in house 2). From Clue 1, the person drinking water must be in house 1 (since the person wearing sandals is in house 1).

So, we have:
- House 1: Person drinking water, Person wearing sandals
- House 2: Person eating kiwis, Person liking yellow

"The person who is eating kiwis lives in house 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 4."
"The person who had stew lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 3** states that the root beer lover lives in the first house. So, the first house is occupied by the person who likes root beer.
2. **Clue 2** tells us that the person who only drinks water lives in the second house. So, the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water.
3. **Clue 1** states that the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone. Since the person who only drinks water is in the second house, the person who has a bouquet of daffodils must be in the first house, and the person who has a phone must be in the third house.
4. **Clue 4** says the person who has a television does not live in the second house. Since the second house is occupied by the person who only drinks water, the person who has a television must be in either the first or the third house. But since the first house is occupied by the person who likes root beer, the person who has a television must be in the third house.
5. **Clue 5** states that the person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips. Since the person who has a television is in the third house, the person who has a vase of tulips must be in the second house.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: Person who likes root beer (bouquet of tulips)
- House 2: Person who only drinks water (bouquet of daffodils)
- House 3: Person who likes root beer (bouquet of tulips) (but this contradicts Clue 3, so this must be a different person)

Since the root beer lover is in house 1, the person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2, and the person with the daffodils must be in house 1. This leaves house 3 for the person who likes root beer.

Therefore, the person who likes root beer lives in house 3.

The correct answer is (A) 3."
"The person who has a computer lives in House 2.

So, the correct answer is (A) 2."
"Given the constraints and the logical deductions, let's re-evaluate the clues step by step:

1. **The golfer does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the golfer can live in houses 1 or 2.

2. **The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns horses.**
   - This means if the fish enthusiast is in house 1, the person who owns horses must be in house 2 or 3.
   - If the fish enthusiast is in house 2, the person who owns horses must be in house 3.

3. **The golfer and the baseball player live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the golfer and the baseball player must be in adjacent houses.

4. **The person who has a carnations arrangement and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement and the person who owns horses must be in adjacent houses.

5. **The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the baseball player.**
   - This means the carnations arrangement and the baseball player must be in adjacent houses, and the carnations arrangement must be in a house to the left of the baseball player.

6. **The person who has a rose bouquet lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.**
   - This means the rose bouquet and the bouquet of daffodils must be in adjacent houses, with the rose bouquet being to the left of the bouquet of daffodils.

7. **The cricketer does not live in the third house.**
   - This means the cricketer can live in houses 1 or 2.

### Analyzing the Clues

- If the golfer is in house 1, the baseball player must be in house 2 (since they must be adjacent).
- If the golfer is in house 2, the baseball player must be in house 1 (since they must be adjacent).

Let's consider the possible placements:

- If the golfer is in house 1, the baseball player is in house 2. The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (since they live next to each other), and the person who owns horses must be in house 2 or 3. But house 2 is already taken by the baseball player, so the person who owns horses must be in house 3.
- If the golfer is in house 2, the baseball player is in house 1. The fish enthusiast must be in house 1 (since they live next to each other), and the person who owns horses must be in house 2 or 3. But house 2 is already taken by the baseball player, so the person who owns horses must be in house 3.

In both scenarios, the person who owns horses must be in house 3.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is **3**.

**Final Answer: (A) 3**"
"The person who drives a truck lives in house 2.

So, the correct answer is (A) 2."
The correct option is (B) 4.
"The person who is eating mangos lives in house number 5. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 5."
"The saxophonist lives in house 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1."
"Given the clues, let's deduce the arrangement step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The cellist lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - This means the cellist must be in house 1 and the mystery book reader must be in house 2.

2. **Clue 2:** The history book buff lives somewhere to the left of the cat lover.
   - Since the cellist is in house 1 and the mystery book reader is in house 2, the history book buff must be in house 1 and the cat lover must be in house 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The root beer lover and the guitarist live directly next to each other.
   - This clue is consistent with the arrangement where the root beer lover is in house 1 and the guitarist is in house 2.

From the above deductions:
- House 1: History book buff (root beer lover)
- House 2: Cellist (mystery book reader)

Therefore, the person who owns horses lives in house 1.

The number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Given the clues, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 1:** The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - This means if the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3. If the bird keeper is in house 3, there is no house to the right of house 3, so this scenario is not possible.

2. **Clue 2:** The dog owner does not live in the second house.
   - This means the dog owner can only live in house 1 or house 3.

3. **Clue 3:** The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - This means the person with the vase of tulips must live in house 3 if the dog owner lives in house 1, and in house 3 or house 2 if the dog owner lives in house 2.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

- If the dog owner is in house 1:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 1 (Clue 1).
  - The bird keeper must be in house 2 or house 3.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 2, the carnations arrangement must be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 1.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 3 (Clue 3).

- If the dog owner is in house 3:
  - The bird keeper cannot be in house 3 (Clue 1).
  - The bird keeper must be in house 1 or house 2.
  - If the bird keeper is in house 1, the carnations arrangement must be in house 2 (Clue 1).
  - The dog owner is in house 3.
  - The person with the vase of tulips must be in house 2 (Clue 3).

From the above analysis, the only consistent scenario is when the dog owner is in house 1, the bird keeper is in house 2, and the person with the vase of tulips is in house 3.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **3**.

So, the correct answer is (C) 3."

    - Possible positions: (1, 2) or (2, 3) or (3, 4)

From Clue 4, we know the swimmer is in House 4. From Clue 7, the phone is in House 1 and the sandals are in House 2. From Clue 8, the person eating oranges is in House 1 and the computer is in House 2.

Now, let's place the remaining characteristics:

- House 1: Oranges, Phone
- House 2: Computer, Sandals
- House 3: Not apples, Not loafers, Not lilies
- House 4: Swimmer

From Clue 3, there is one house between the person wearing boots and the person eating kiwis. This means the person wearing boots must be in House 1 or 2, and the person eating kiwis must be in House 3 or 4. Since House 1 and 2 are occupied by the phone and computer, the person eating kiwis must be in House 4.

So, House 4: Swimmer, House 3: Not apples, Not loafers, Not lilies.

From Clue 2, the person eating apples cannot be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 or 2. Since House 1 is occupied by oranges and House 2 by computer and sandals, the person eating apples must be in House 3.

House 3: Not apples, Not loafers, Not lilies, Apples

From Clue 11, the person with a rose bouquet must be in House 1 or 2, and the person eating a banana must be in House 2 or 3. Since House 2 is occupied by computer and sandals, the person eating a banana must be in House 3.

House 3: Apples, Banana, Rose Bouquet

From Clue 10, the person wearing loafers cannot be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 or 2. Since House 1 is occupied by oranges and House 2 by computer and sandals, the person wearing loafers must be in House 2.

House 2: Computer, Sandals, Loafers

From Clue 6, the person with a vase of tulips must be in House 1 or 2. Since House 1 is occupied by oranges and House 2 by computer, the person with a vase of tulips must be in House 1.

House 1: Oranges, Phone, Vase of Tulips

From Clue 5, the person wearing boots cannot be in House 2, so they must be in House 1 or 3. Since House 1 is occupied by oranges and House 3 by apples, the person wearing boots must be in House 3.

House 3: Apples, Banana, Rose Bouquet, Boots

From Clue 12, the person with a gameboy must be in House 1 or 2. Since House 1 is occupied by oranges and House 2 by computer, the person with a gameboy must be in House 1.

House 1: Oranges, Phone, Vase of Tulips, Gameboy

From Clue 9, the person with a bouquet of lilies cannot be in House 3, so they must be in House 1 or 2. Since House 1 is occupied by oranges and House 2 by computer, the person with a bouquet of lilies must be in House 2.

House 2: Computer, Sandals, Loafers, Lilies

Thus, the person wearing loafers lives in House 2.

The answer is (D) 2."
"The bird keeper lives in house 4. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 4."
"Given the clues, let's break it down step by step:

1. The mystery book reader lives in the first house.
2. The bird keeper lives directly left of the history book buff.
3. The romance book lover does not live in the third house.
4. The person who owns horses does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

From Clue 3, the bird keeper and the history book buff must be in adjacent houses. Since the mystery book reader is in the first house, the only possible adjacent houses are the second and third houses.

From Clue 2, the person who owns horses does not live in the third house. Therefore, the bird keeper must live in the third house, and the history book buff must live in the second house.

This leaves the romance book lover to live in the first house, but we already know the first house is occupied by the mystery book reader.

Thus, the romance book lover must live in the third house.

The number of the house where the romance book lover lives is **(C) 3**."
"Given the clues, let's analyze them step by step:

1. The coffee drinker lives in the second house.
2. The person eating apples lives directly left of the person drinking water.
3. The person eating mangos does not live in the first house.
4. The person eating mangos does not live in the third house.
5. The person eating apples lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.
6. The person eating kiwis does not live in the third house.

From Clue 1, we know the coffee drinker lives in house 2.

From Clue 3, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 1 or 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 4, the person eating mangos cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 4.

From Clue 6, the person eating kiwis cannot be in house 3, so they must be in house 1 or 2 or 4. Since the mangos eater is in house 4, the kiwis eater must be in house 1 or 2.

From Clue 2, the person eating apples must be to the left of the person drinking water. Given the mangos eater is in house 4, the apples eater must be in house 1, and the water drinker must be in house 3.

This leaves the tea drinker in house 2, but since the coffee drinker is already in house 2, the tea drinker must be in house 3.

Thus, the coffee drinker lives in house 2.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"The person who is eating a banana lives in house 3. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 3."
"The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house. Therefore, the correct answer is:

To elaborate on the reasoning without referencing the previous response:

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. Clue 6 tells us the flutist is directly left of the person who drives a minivan. This means the flutist must be in house 1 and the person who drives a minivan must be in house 2.
2. Clue 5 states the minivan is to the right of the truck. Therefore, the truck must be in house 3.
3. Clue 2 states the truck and the person with the gameboy are next to each other. Since the truck is in house 3, the gameboy must be in house 2.
4. Clue 3 states the minivan and the cellist are next to each other. Since the minivan is in house 2, the cellist must be in house 3.
5. Clue 4 states the person with high heels and the person with the television are next to each other. Since the cellist is in house 3, the person with high heels and the person with the television must be in houses 1 and 2. Since the gameboy is in house 2, the person with the television must be in house 1 and the person with high heels must be in house 2.
6. Clue 7 states the person with boots is to the right of the percussionist. Since the person with boots must be in house 2 (the only remaining house), the percussionist must be in house 1.

Thus, the percussionist lives in house 1."

- House 5: Grapes

Since the person who is eating grapes lives in house 5, the person who is eating oranges must be in house 4 (since they live directly left of the saxophonist, and the saxophonist must be in house 3).

- House 1: Violinist (since the violinist and the person who is eating oranges live directly next to each other, and the violinist must be in house 1).
- House 2: Bouquet of daffodils
- House 3: Television
- House 4: Pianist

Avoiding internet trolls on Reddit is generally not possible, as trolls are a part of the Reddit community and are known for their provocative and often disruptive behavior. However, there are some strategies you can use to minimize their impact:

1. **Ignore and Report**: Trolls often thrive on attention. Ignoring their posts and reporting them to Reddit can help reduce their visibility and impact.
2. **Use Filters and Subreddit Settings**: Some subreddits have filters or settings that can help reduce the number of troll posts you see.
3. **Stay Alert and Vigilant**: Be aware of the signs of troll behavior and be prepared to take action if necessary.
4. **Engage with Respect**: Sometimes, engaging with trolls in a respectful manner can help defuse the situation. However, this is not always effective and can sometimes escalate the situation.
5. **Use Moderators**: If a troll is causing significant disruption, you can flag the post or the user to the subreddit's moderators, who can take action.

These strategies can help, but it's important to recognize that trolls are a part of the Reddit community and may always be present to some degree."

"The question about the status of Japanese serfdom compared to English serfdom is complex and requires a nuanced understanding of both systems. In Japan, the feudal system, known as the Bakufu system, was centered around the samurai class, who were warriors and not necessarily tied to the land in the same way as serfs in medieval England. The Japanese feudal system was more about military service and land grants, rather than a system of personal servitude.

In England, serfdom was a system where peasants were bound to the land and had limited rights. They were often required to work on the lord's land in exchange for protection and basic necessities. The status of serfs in England was generally lower than that of the nobility but higher than that of free peasants.

Given these differences, it would be inaccurate to say that Japanese serfdom had a higher status than English serfdom. The Japanese feudal system, while involving a form of dependency, was structured differently and did not have the same level of personal servitude as English serfdom.
