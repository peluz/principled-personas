"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we start by calculating the total number of eggs laid by her ducks each day, which is 16 eggs.

Next, we subtract the eggs she eats for breakfast, which is 3 eggs. This leaves us with:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \text{ eggs} \]

Then, we subtract the eggs she uses to bake muffins, which is 4 eggs. This leaves us with:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Since she sells each of these remaining eggs for $2, the total amount of money she makes every day is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of each type of fiber required and then sum them up.

1. **Blue Fiber:**
   - The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. **White Fiber:**
   - The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.
   - Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
     \]

3. **Total Bolts of Fiber:**
   - Sum the bolts of blue and white fiber:
     \[
     2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
     \]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine the profit Josh made, we start by calculating the total cost of the house after the repairs. The initial cost of the house is $80,000, and he adds $50,000 in repairs, making the total cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Next, we calculate the increase in value due to the 150% increase. A 150% increase means the value increases by 1.5 times the original total cost:
\[ 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original total cost gives the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the original total cost from the new value:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one session (3 sprints):**
   Since he runs 3 sprints each time, the total distance for one session is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one week:**
   James runs 3 times a week, so the total distance for one week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{540}

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:**
   - Morning feed: 15 cups
   - Afternoon feed: 25 cups
   - Total feed for morning and afternoon: \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups

2. **Determine the total amount of feed needed for the entire day:**
   - Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day.
   - She has 20 chickens.
   - Total feed for the day: \( 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \)

3. **Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   - Total feed for the day: 60 cups
   - Feed given in the morning and afternoon: 40 cups
   - Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \)

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is 20.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost for every second glass:
- The cost of the first glass is $5.
- The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
- The cost of the third glass is $5.
- The cost of the fourth glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
- This pattern continues for every second glass.

We can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can group them into 8 pairs (since 16 divided by 2 is 8).

The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start with the given information:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Adding the number of sheep in each city together gives us the total number of sheep:
\[20 + 80 + 160 = 260\]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we break down the process into segments:

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update and restart:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each part:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update and restart: 20 minutes
- Time for the remaining download: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered: \( 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered: \( 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining: \( 4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \).
   - Distance covered: \( 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Now, we sum up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ \boxed{315} \]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Earnings from regular hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   - Overtime rate = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour.
   - Earnings from overtime = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime.
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460."
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we will calculate the downloads for each month and then sum them up.

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month.

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the lemon tree is $90.
2. **Revenue per Year**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue per year is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year}
   \]
3. **Cost per Year**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit per year is the revenue minus the cost:
\[
\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year}
\]

Since the initial cost of $90 is a one-time expense, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost. We set up the equation:
\[
7.5 \times \text{number of years} = 90
\]

Solving for the number of years:
\[
\text{number of years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item after the respective market increases and then find the difference between the two future values.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The merchant would maximize profit by choosing to purchase the jewelry, which would result in a profit of $125.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to sum her earnings from both teaching and coaching.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Daily Egg Consumption**: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.
2. **Weekly Egg Consumption**: There are 7 days in a week, so Claire uses \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}\).
3. **Total Egg Consumption in 4 Weeks**: Over 4 weeks, Claire will use \(21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}\).
4. **Conversion to Dozens**: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the total number of dozens of eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks is \(\frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen}\).

Therefore, the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Given average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time already spent hiking:**
   - Time for the first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time for the next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time already spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Calculate the remaining time:**
   - Total time desired = 3 hours
   - Time already spent = 2 hours
   - Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Distance already covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

5. **Determine the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Remaining distance = 6 miles
   - Remaining time = 1 hour
   - Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

"To determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters after the spill, we start by calculating the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink.

First, calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

Adding these amounts gives the total amount of water before the spill:
\[
\frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the total volume of the mixture becomes:
\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water remains the same, which is:
\[
\frac{47}{3} \text{ liters}
\]

To find the concentration of water in the remaining 9 liters, we use the total amount of water:
\[
\text{Concentration of water} = \frac{\frac{47}{3}}{9} = \frac{47}{27} \approx 1.74 \text{ liters per liter}
\]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters is:
\[
9 \times \frac{47}{27} = \frac{423}{27} = 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:

"To find the original price of the book, we start with the information that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount. This means that $19.50 represents 75% of the original price. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To solve for \( P \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Performing the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we start by calculating the total cost of the items she has already purchased:

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives:
\[
12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[
50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can break down the trip as follows:

1. The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
2. The first stop is made after 20 miles, so the distance traveled before the first stop is 20 miles.
3. The second stop is made 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles long, the second stop is at 60 - 15 = 45 miles from the start.
4. The distance traveled between the first and second stops is the difference between the distance at the second stop and the distance at the first stop: 45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles.

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 25 miles.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"To determine the cost of the boots, we start by defining the cost of the boots as \( B \). We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is $66. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:

\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). Given that their total age is 162, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can determine the ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 years to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we start by calculating each friend's guess based on the first friend's guess of 80 jelly beans.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of 80, which is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \), and adding 20 gives \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than 80, which is \( 80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Now, we sum these guesses: \( 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \). To find the average, we divide this sum by the number of guesses, which is 3:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is 80 jelly beans. The correct answer is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily time spent:**
   - Each dog requires 0.5 hours per day.
   - John takes care of 10 dogs.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per day is:
     \[
     0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weekly time spent:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per week is:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

Thus, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is:
\[

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( G = S + 30 \) (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)
2. \( G + S = 110 \) (since the total number of coins is 110)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \):

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 70 \]"

\]

Aaron has 5 more jewels than this amount:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron:

\[
25 - 2 = 23

"To determine the total number of points Mike scored, we need to calculate the points he scored in each of the two 20-minute segments and then sum them up.

1. **First 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores 4 points.

2. **Second 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.
   - To find 25% of 4 points:
     \[
     0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point}
     \]
   - Therefore, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
     \[
     4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total points:**
   - Sum the points from both segments:
     \[
     4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points}
     \]

Thus, the total number of points Mike scored is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   \[
   \text{Total yogurts in 30 days} = 2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts}
   \]

2. **Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:**
   The yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{60 \, \text{yogurts}}{4 \, \text{yogurts/set}} = 15 \, \text{sets}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 15 sets:**
   Each set costs $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15 \, \text{sets} \times 5 \, \text{\$/set} = 75 \, \text{\$}
   \]

Thus, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"John starts with 13 lego sets and sells each for $15. The total amount of money he makes from selling the lego sets is:

\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spends this $195 on 8 video games, each costing $20:

\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This confirms that he indeed spent all $195 on the video games, leaving him with $5. Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he has no lego sets left.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To determine John's running speed, we start by calculating the distance he runs each day. Given that he runs a total of 60 miles in a week and runs 3 days a week, the distance he runs each day is:

\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he runs each of the other two days. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the time he runs on the other two days is:

\[ \text{Time on other two days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time John spends running in a week:

\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find his running speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Therefore, John's running speed is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distances Dana can travel by running and walking, and then sum these distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours.

First, we know Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour. Since skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance traveled by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

Since the walking speed is one-fourth of the running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels by running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can follow these steps:

1. **Suzy's iPhone Age**: Given that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
   \[

   \]

2. **Ben's iPhone Age**: Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone:
   \[
   \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Brandon's iPhone Age**: Given that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone:
   \[
   \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we follow these steps:

1. **Initial Distance Without Gemstone**: Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.
2. **Distance With Gemstone**: When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther, which is \(400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}\).
3. **Distance Beyond Dragon's Reach**: The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin: \(1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}\).

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames when holding the sapphire gemstone.

The final numerical answer is:

"Grandma Jones initially baked 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, resulting in a total of 40 pieces. After the guests had their servings, there were 14 pieces remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is \(26\).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we start by calculating the number of calories you can still consume in a day. Given your daily calorie target of 2000 calories and having already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Each serving of chips contains 50 calories. To find out how many servings you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams of chips you can eat is:

\[ 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the number of grams of chips you can eat is:

\[ 200 \text{ grams} \]

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we start by calculating the total cost of making 20 candles. Since 20 candles require 2 pounds of beeswax, and the cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00, the total cost for 2 pounds is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then find the total time spent writing.

1. **Monday:**
   Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

2. **Tuesday:**
   On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. To find the number of articles written on Tuesday, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find the number of articles written on Wednesday, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[
\text{Total articles} = 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26
\]

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days is:

"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased, we start with the information given:

1. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.
2. She used 220 Post-it notes to place on different cups of coffee.
3. After using these, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

We need to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

The equation representing the situation is:
\[ 80 - 220 + x = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ -140 + x = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \( 163 \).

The correct answer is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"To determine the total amount John spent on ties, we start by calculating the number of blue ties he bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we find:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. Given that each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

The total cost of the red ties is then:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Adding the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties gives:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To determine the time it takes for Tom to get back, we need to consider the distance \( D \) he travels to his destination. The time taken to travel distance \( D \) at 10 mph is given by:

\[ \text{Time to travel to the destination} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

After reaching the destination, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph. The time taken to travel back the same distance \( D \) at 6 mph is:

\[ \text{Time to travel back} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

The total time for the round trip is the sum of these two times:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{D}{10} + \frac{D}{6} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 6 is 30. So we rewrite the fractions:

\[ \frac{D}{10} = \frac{3D}{30} \]
\[ \frac{D}{6} = \frac{5D}{30} \]

Adding these fractions gives:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{3D}{30} + \frac{5D}{30} = \frac{8D}{30} = \frac{4D}{15} \text{ hours} \]

"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day based on the given rates and the number of tires repaired.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60 \text{ per truck tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$480\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480\)

Now, we compare the total revenues:
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

Therefore, the mechanic earned \$40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we start by calculating the available weight capacity for the boxes. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum weight that can be added to the truck (the weight of the boxes) is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the maximum allowable weight of the boxes by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

"To determine the number of good oranges, we start with the total number of oranges, which is 25. We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% of the oranges are unripe, and 2 oranges are sour. First, we calculate the number of unripe oranges:

\[
\text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
\]

Next, we sum the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges:

\[
\text{Total of bad, unripe, and sour oranges} = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8
\]

Subtracting this from the total number of oranges gives us the number of good oranges:

\[
\text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - 8 = 17
\]

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{17}

"To determine the total amount Janet paid, we start by calculating the total cost of the brooch before insurance. This includes the cost of the material and the cost of construction:

\[ \text{Total cost before insurance} = \$500 + \$800 = \$1300 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:

\[ \text{Cost of insurance} = 0.10 \times \$1300 = \$130 \]

Adding the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance gives us the final amount Janet paid:

\[ \text{Total amount paid} = \$1300 + \$130 = \$1430 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is \( \$1430 \)."
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the pension structure over the specified period.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Therefore, for the first 20 years, her total pension is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - Therefore, her pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000 per year:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - For the first 20 years, she earns $50,000 per year.
   - For the next 10 years, she earns $50,000 per year.
   - Therefore, her total annual pension after 30 years is:
     \[
     50,000 + 50,000 = 100,000 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

Thus, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is \(\boxed{100000}\)."
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the payments for each half of the year and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost for the first half of the year:**
   - There are 6 months in a half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 140 = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The second half of the year also has 6 months.
   - The charge for the second half is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - First, find 10% of $140:
     \[
     0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Subtract this 10% from the initial amount to get the reduced charge for the second half:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 126 = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year:**
   - Add the costs for the first and second halves of the year:
     \[
     840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **Level 4 (top level):**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = 16
   \]

2. **Level 3:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

3. **Level 2:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]

4. **Level 1:**
   \[

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required for the first 180 days and the remaining days of the first year.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \).

2. **Determine the remaining days in the first year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days = \( 365 \, \text{days} - 180 \, \text{days} = 185 \, \text{days} \).

3. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:**
   - The puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day for the remaining 185 days.
   - Total dog food for the remaining 185 days = \( 2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups} \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:**
   - Total dog food for the first year = \( 180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups} \).

5. **Determine the number of bags of dog food needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{550 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = 5 \, \text{bags} \).

Thus, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the amount of laundry Sarah does, which is given as 400 pounds. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing 400 pounds by 4:

\[
\text{Laundry done by David} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does, which is half of what Sarah does:

\[
\text{Laundry done by Raymond} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does:

\[
\text{Difference} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

\[
\boxed{100}

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each versus buying them in packages of 2 for $1 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- The total cost for 6 packages of 3 flowers is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- The total cost for 9 packages of 2 flowers is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9.00
  \]

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2: $9.00

Vincent saves more money by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2. The amount saved is:
\[
15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00
\]

Thus, the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is \(\boxed{6.00}\)."

\]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:

\[
4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we add the 6 liters of water that the boy received:

\[
8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

The initial total amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left after the girls and the boy have taken their portions is:

\[
24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of games they lost as \( L \) and the number of games they won as \( W \). According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so we can write:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

We also know that the total number of games played is 22, so:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games they won is 15. The correct answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."

The company increases her salary by 10% of her initial salary every year for those who have stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she qualifies for this increase.

1. **Initial Salary**: $600 per month.

2. **First Year Increase**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]

3. **Second Year Increase**:
   \[

"Let's solve the problem step by step. We are given that Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). Consequently, Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The final numerical answer is:

For the adults:
- Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

For the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is 5 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Adding the total potato salad needed for both adults and children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we start with the information given:

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.

"To determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Calculate Lee's original speed:**
   Lee's speed \( S_L \) is:
   \[
   S_L = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

3. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   Since Lee is two seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald's original time \( T_G \) is:
   \[
   T_G = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Calculate Gerald's original speed:**
   Gerald's speed \( S_G \) is:
   \[
   S_G = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

5. **Calculate Gerald's improved speed:**
   With a 10% improvement, Gerald's improved speed \( S_G' \) is:
   \[
   S_G' = 10 \text{ meters/second} + 0.10 \times 10 \text{ meters/second} = 10 \text{ meters/second} + 1 \text{ meter/second} = 11 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

6. **Determine Gerald's improved time:**
   Using his improved speed, Gerald's improved time \( T_G' \) is:
   \[
   T_G' = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 36.36 seconds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36.36}

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the variables:

1. The number of dogs \( D \) is 60.
2. The number of cats \( C \) is twice the number of dogs, so \( C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).
3. The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 \).

Next, we calculate the total number of pets in the neighborhood by summing the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we start by calculating the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class. Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can find the number of boys as follows:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Thus, the number of girls who are not in the girl scout is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we start by noting that Harry slept 9 hours. James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept, which can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we find the difference in the hours slept by Harry and James:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}

"To determine the number of tomatoes Freda used, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce:
     \[
     \text{Original volume of tomatoes} = 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes per can:**
   - Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.

3. **Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used:**
   - Since the original volume of tomatoes is 64 ounces and each can contains 16 ounces, the number of cans used is:
     \[
     \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

5. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Since 4 cans were used and each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
     \[
     \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Given:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit.
- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

The number of cars remaining on the motorway after the traffic jam is:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = 5 - x \]

Since the remaining cars are the ones that did not drive through the traffic jam, and the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \), we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - (5 - x) \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ x + 20 = 30 - 5 + x \]
\[ x + 20 = 25 + x \]

Subtracting \( x \) from both sides:
\[ 20 = 25 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( x = 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to \(2 \times 40 = 80\) potted plants. She then receives 18 more potted plants, increasing her total to \(80 + 18 = 98\) potted plants. She plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, which amounts to \(1 \times 40 = 40\) potted plants. Therefore, the number of potted plants she will remain with is \(98 - 40 = 58\).

The final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is \(\boxed{58}\)."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we will sum the individual counts from each friend:

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend, which is \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which is \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

Now, we sum these values:
\[
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175
\]

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day over the remaining 4 days, we start by calculating the total number of pages he needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Adding these together gives:
\[ 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 \text{ pages} \]

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:
\[ 39 - 15 = 24 \text{ pages} \]

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ days}} = 6 \text{ pages per day} \]

Thus, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day for the remaining 4 days. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we can break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a single weekday:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a single weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ glass of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the total glasses of water consumed on weekdays and weekends to find the total for the entire week:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:

"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by noting the city's total length across the oceanfront to the inland edge, which is 42 miles. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. 

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[
\text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we find the total time to cover 42 miles:
\[
\text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the entire city. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we start by determining the inner dimensions of a single box. Given that the outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches and the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions are calculated as follows:

- Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches
- Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches
- Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches

Next, we calculate the volume of one inner box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, \(V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}\):

\[
V = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Since there are 3 boxes, the total inner volume \(V_{\text{total}}\) is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\) cubic inches."
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first calculate the total hours of TV he watched from Monday to Friday:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes (1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours

Summing these up:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. The additional time he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To determine the number of cookies Henry intended to bake last year, we start with the information that he actually baked twice as many as he intended plus 15 more cookies. This can be expressed as:

\[ 2x + 15 \]

After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \]

We know that after these adjustments, he has 110 cookies. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]
\[ x = \frac{100}{2} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Thus, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies last year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine the final cost after applying the cashback, we follow these steps:

"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice, the fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so the total number of fruit roll-ups she ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

For Marcell, the fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total by 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how much water the boat took on by the time Julia reached the shore, we first calculate the speed at which Julia rows the boat. Given that she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we find out how long it takes her to row 64 seconds to the shore. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, the time to row 64 feet is:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 feet} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{20 \text{ feet/16 seconds}} = \frac{64}{20} \times 16 = 3.2 \times 16 = 51.2 \text{ seconds} \]

However, the problem states that the shore is 64 seconds away, which means the boat has been rowing for 64 seconds by the time Julia reaches the shore. During this time, the boat takes on water at a rate of 2 liters for every 10 feet rowed. Therefore, the amount of water taken on is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 6.4 \times 2 = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

Given the options, the closest and most appropriate answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the relationships given:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This can be expressed as:
\[ B = 50D \]
Given \( B = 300 \), we substitute and solve for \( D \):
\[ 300 = 50D \]
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we first calculate the total cost of the lumber she has. She has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber, each costing $10, and 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber, each costing $16.

1. **Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   \[
   10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100
   \]

2. **Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   \[
   5 \text{ boards} \times \$16 \text{ per board} = \$80
   \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[
\$100 + \$80 = \$180
\]

Since the problem does not specify the selling price, we assume she sells the lumber at the same cost price. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the lumber is also \$180.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$180 - \$180 = \$0
\]

Thus, the profit Sasha makes is:
\[
\boxed{0}

"To solve the problem, we start by determining Lylah's initial salary. Given that Adrien's initial salary is $40,000 and it is 30% higher than Lylah's salary, we can set up the equation:

\[ 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23 \]

Next, we calculate Adrien's salary four years later, which is 40% higher than his initial salary:

\[ 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \]

Similarly, we calculate Lylah's salary four years later, which is 40% higher than her initial salary:

\[ 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92 \]

Finally, we find the total salary the two were receiving four years later by adding their individual salaries:

"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we break the problem into two parts based on the different speeds she runs at.

First, we calculate the distance Rosie covers in the initial 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the remaining time after the initial 3 hours:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Then, we calculate the distance Rosie covers in the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of letters Jennie stamped:**
   Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

2. **Determine the number of letters that were already stamped:**
   After stamping 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

3. **Calculate the initial number of already-stamped letters:**
   The number of already-stamped letters increased by the number of letters Jennie stamped.
   \[
   \text{Initial number of already-stamped letters} = 30 - 20 = 10

"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total number of patient hours per day:**
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, each patient is seen for \( \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \) hours.
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Total patient hours per day = \( 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the revenue from the patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients.
   - Total revenue from patients = \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost to the hospital:**
   - The doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
   - Total cost to the hospital = \( 200 \times 150 = 30,000 \) dollars.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

Given the relationships:
1. \( W = 2B \) (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees).
2. \( B = 2Q \) (there are twice as many baby bees as queens).

The total number of bees is 700:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \):
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

"To find the total cost including tax, we first calculate the tax on the nonfood items (light bulbs and roach traps). The tax rate is 10%.

- Tax on light bulbs: \(3 \times 0.10 = 0.30\) dollars
- Tax on roach traps: \(4 \times 0.10 = 0.40\) dollars

Adding the tax to the original costs of the nonfood items:

- Total cost of light bulbs including tax: \(3 + 0.30 = 3.30\) dollars
- Total cost of roach traps including tax: \(4 + 0.40 = 4.40\) dollars

Next, we sum the costs of all items:

- Cost of milk: \(2\) dollars
- Cost of eggs: \(3\) dollars
- Cost of cups: \(3\) dollars

Adding these together:

\[

"To determine the profit Kim will make each week, we first need to calculate his total expenses. Kim has 8 clients, and each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.

The cost of one bottle of bleach is $2, and the cost of one pack of cloths is $5. Therefore, the total cost for bleach for 8 clients is:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles/client} \times \$2/\text{bottle} = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = \$32 \]

The total cost for cloths for 8 clients is:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack/client} \times \$5/\text{pack} = 8 \times 1 \times 5 = \$40 \]

Adding these together gives the total expenses:
\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is $92. Therefore, the profit is calculated as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses} = \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Thus, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we start by calculating the number of harvests he can have in a year. Since John harvests every 3 months and there are 12 months in a year, the number of harvests per year is:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Given that John can harvest 100 pineapples per hectare every 3 months, the number of pineapples harvested per hectare in a year is:

\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Since John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first set, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

Thus, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"To determine the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return, which is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]

4. **Bee population at the end of the first 12 hours:**
   Initially, there were no bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, and 15 bees returned, the net change is:
   \[
   0 - 30 + 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   So, at the end of the first 12 hours, there are:
   \[
   0 - 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   This means there are 15 bees that left but haven't returned yet.

5. **Bee population at the end of the day:**
   In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return to the hive. The number of bees that left in the first 12 hours is 60, and all of them return in the last 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is:
   \[
   60 \text{ bees}
   \]

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:
\[

"To determine the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to consider the cost of the tickets and the change received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for one adult and one child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how many friends James has, we start by finding out how many friends Dorothy has. Given that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Solving for Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Next, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we calculate James's friends as follows:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we first need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Since there are 5280 feet in a mile, we calculate:

- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time each person takes to travel their respective distances:

- Time for Steve to bike home: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim to skateboard home: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The difference in their travel times is:

\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one bicycle: \(2 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 50 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 5 bicycles: \(5 \times 50 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents}\).

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one tricycle: \(3 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 75 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 3 tricycles: \(3 \times 75 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents}\).

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one unicycle: \(1 \text{ tire} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 25 \text{ cents}\).

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the tires:
\[
250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[
500 \text{ cents} = 5 \text{ dollars}

3. After the seagull, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
5. After the pigeons, the remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
6. A raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) \) fries.
7. After the raccoon, the remaining fries are \( x - 30 - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \).
8. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
9. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6 \implies x - 30 = 18 \implies x = 48
   \]

Thus, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \( 48 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the hours spent on different days and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Finally, we sum the hours from both types of days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we first convert the lengths of each type of baked good into a consistent unit, which we'll use inches for simplicity.

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Total length of rolls = \( 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \).

2. **Chocolate Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Total length of croissants = \( 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \).

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is \( 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \).
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of baguettes = \( 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \).

4. **Total Length in Inches:**
   - Total length = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes
   - Total length = \( 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \).

5. **Convert Total Length to Feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Total length in feet = \( \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \).

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is \( 280 \) feet.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{280}
\]"
"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana consumption for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monthly consumption: 200 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas} \)

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Monthly consumption: 400 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas} \)

3. **Baboons:**
   - Monthly consumption: 100 bananas
   - For 2 months: \( 100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas} \)

Next, we sum the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over the 2 months:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how much farther Blake runs than Kelly, we first calculate the distance each person runs.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distance run by Blake and Kelly:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly). The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. When 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, the total number of tadpoles Finn can see becomes \(11 + 6 = 17\). Then, when 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, the total number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2, resulting in \(17 - 2 = 15\).

Therefore, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is 15."
"To determine the water depth on Wednesday, we start with the depth of the water on Monday, which is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increases by 7 feet, making the depth 24 feet. On Wednesday, the depth is two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday. Therefore, we calculate the depth on Wednesday as follows:

\[
\text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we start by calculating the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the given information:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Next, we sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these totals together gives us the total number of fish caught:

\[
15 \text{ (starfish)} + 9 \text{ (sea horses)} + 8 \text{ (clownfish)} = 32
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( P_0 = \$20 \)
   - Rate of increase: 20% every two months

2. **Calculate the price increase per two months:**
   - Increase per two months: \( 20\% \) of \( \$20 \)
   - Increase per two months: \( 0.20 \times 20 = \$4 \)

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Number of two-month periods in 36 months: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

4. **Calculate the total increase over 36 months:**
   - Total increase: \( 18 \times \$4 = \$72 \)

5. **Calculate the new price after 36 months:**
   - New price: \( P_0 + \text{Total increase} \)
   - New price: \( 20 + 72 = \$92 \)

Thus, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{92}\)."

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to compare the missed income from freelance work to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie loses 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour. Therefore, the missed income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

The accountant charges $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

Thus, Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{-15} \]"
"Elvira's total budget is €1500. The total cost of the computer accessories she bought is €157 (screen) + €74 (keyboard and mouse) + €102 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €509. 

To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991.

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is €991. 

The correct answer is €991."

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.
- Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, we simplify the second equation:
\[
S + B + 4 = 28
\]
\[
S + B = 24
\]

Next, we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the simplified second equation:
\[
2B + B = 24
\]
\[
3B = 24
\]
\[
B = 8
\]

Now, we find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[
S = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to account for his walking routine on weekdays and weekends separately.

1. **Weekdays**: There are 5 weekdays in a week, and on each weekday, Pancho walks 20 miles.
   \[
   \text{Miles walked on weekdays} = 5 \text{ days} \times 20 \text{ miles/day} = 100 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Weekends**: There are 2 days in the weekend, and on each weekend day, Pancho walks 10 miles.
   \[
   \text{Miles walked on weekends} = 2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ miles/day} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total miles walked in a week**:
   \[
   \text{Total miles} = \text{Miles walked on weekdays} + \text{Miles walked on weekends} = 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles."
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component (hat, jacket, and pants) and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the hat} = \$25
   \]

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
   \]

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.

"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payments:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payments and add it to the minimum monthly payments.

50% of $1000 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, 50% more than the minimum monthly payments is:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month} \]

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine the total time Billy will take to prep 60 potatoes, we start by calculating the time required for one potato. It takes Billy 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds) to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut it. Therefore, the total time for one potato is:

\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:

\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:

"To determine the amount Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we start by calculating the total revenue from selling lemonade. They sell each gallon for $10 (20 glasses at $0.50 each), and they made a profit of $25. This means their total revenue was $25 + $5 (total cost of lemons and sugar) = $30. Since their revenue from selling 5 gallons is $30, we can confirm that they sold 5 gallons.

Next, we calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3, so for 5 gallons, the cost is $3 * 5 = $15.

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is $15. The correct answer is:

\[

\]

2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
\[
\text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
\]

3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500
\]

4. Calculate the donation to charity, which is half of the remaining amount:
\[
\text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250
\]

5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250
\]

6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount:
\[

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we start with the total number of votes cast, which is 80. The winner received \(\frac{3}{4}\) of these votes. Let's calculate the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total votes minus the votes received by the winner:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser received is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the number of red roses Sandra ordered, we start by defining the number of white carnations as \( w \). According to the problem, the number of pink calla lilies is 200, and this is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 5w = 200 \]

Solving for \( w \):

\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is:

\[ 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Thus, the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business is 160.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Jean's current age, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine Mark's age two years ago:**
   - Jan's current age is 30, so two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time, which is \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\). Therefore, Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old two years ago.
   - Mark's current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\) years old.

2. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\) years old.

Thus, Jean is 23 years old. The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

### Team 1 (Very Well-Rounded Team)
Each member of Team 1 runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time taken by Team 1 is:
\[
55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team)
The first runner of Team 2 takes 60 seconds to run their 400 meters. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for each runner are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time taken by Team 2 is the sum of the times for each runner:
\[
60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Difference in Time
To find out how many seconds the faster team (Team 1) will win by, we subtract the total time taken by Team 1 from the total time taken by Team 2:
\[
222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team (Team 1) will win by:
\[

"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = P(\text{even number on first roll}) \times P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities
We need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This is given by the difference in probabilities divided by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then converted to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) - P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To find how much more likely it is, we divide this difference by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and then convert to a percentage:
\[
\text{Percentage more likely} = \left( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \right) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we start by calculating the total number of pieces of straw allocated to the hamsters and the rabbits. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw, so the total for the hamsters is:

\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Additionally, 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw allocated to the hamsters and the rabbits is:

\[ 50 \text{ pieces} + 20 \text{ pieces} = 70 \text{ pieces} \]

Given that the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160, the number of pieces of straw allocated to the rats is:

\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 70 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Since each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is:

\[ \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

With 3 cages of rats, the number of rats in each cage is:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we need to calculate the total amount including the interest accrued.

1. **Initial amount owed**: $100
2. **Monthly interest rate**: 2% or 0.02
3. **Number of months**: 3

First, calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Next, calculate the total interest for 3 months:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, add the total interest to the initial amount owed to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict **$106**.

The correct answer is **$106**."
"To determine the number of bags of wheat sold, we start by defining the number of bags as \( n \).

The cost of buying \( n \) bags of wheat is \( 20n \) dollars, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is \( 2n \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \text{ dollars} \]

The revenue from selling \( n \) bags of wheat at $30 each is:
\[ 30n \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, and it is given that the trader made a total profit of $400. Thus, we can write the profit equation as:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

Therefore, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags of wheat."
"To determine how much each friend paid, we first calculate the total cost of the tickets and food. The cost of the tickets is $20.25, and the cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, which is $15.75. Adding these together gives:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

Next, we add the cost of the rides, which is $33 per ride for 2 rides:

\[ 33 \times 2 = 66 \]

Adding the cost of the rides to the total cost of the tickets and food gives:

\[ 36.00 + 66 = 102.00 \]

Since the total cost is to be split evenly among the three friends, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102.00}{3} = 34.00 \]

Therefore, each friend paid $34.00. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

The final numerical answer is 360."
"To determine the daily amount of insects needed for a flock of ten ducks, we start with the weekly requirement for one duck, which is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we first calculate the daily requirement for one duck:

\[ \text{Daily requirement for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we extend this daily requirement to the entire flock of ten ducks:

\[ \text{Daily requirement for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees each year**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net increase of \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Number of trees after 10 years without any deaths**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Therefore, the total number of trees after 10 years is \(50 + 80 = 130\).
4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\).
5. **Number of trees left after the deaths**: The number of trees left after the deaths is \(130 - 39 = 91\).

Thus, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"To determine the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday, let's follow the steps methodically:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 flamingos is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) flamingos.
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **Number of flamingos left on Sue's front yard after Saturday morning:**
   - Initially, there were 18 flamingos.
   - 6 flamingos were taken back and painted white.
   - Therefore, \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) pink flamingos remained.

4. **On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos:**
   - Adding 18 more pink flamingos to the 12 remaining flamingos:
   - \( 12 + 18 = 30 \) pink flamingos.

5. **Number of white flamingos:**
   - The neighbors painted 6 pink flamingos white.
   - Therefore, there are 6 white flamingos.

6. **At noon on Sunday, the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 30
   - White flamingos: 6

7. **Difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - \( 30 - 6 = 24 \)

"To determine the change Violetta will receive, we first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the change Violetta will get is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as this combined amount, a pen costs $1.50. To find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we start by calculating the total amount of carrots distributed to the 40 restaurants. Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, so the total distribution is:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount of carrots distributed from the initial amount of carrots:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we will calculate the number of cards collected each month and then sum them up with her initial number of cards.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collects three times the initial number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collects 20 fewer cards than in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collects twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

5. **Total number of cards collected over the three months:**
   \[
   60 + 40 + 200 = 200 \text{ cards}

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we start by calculating his earnings from each publisher separately.

First, we know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Since Mark edits 1000 sentences each week for Publisher A, his earnings from Publisher A are:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents per sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A per sentence. Therefore, Publisher B pays Mark:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]

For the 1000 sentences edited each week for Publisher B, his earnings are:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents per sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives us the total weekly earnings:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Thus, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"

"To determine how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to calculate his total earnings from both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

1. **Monetary Reward:**
   John receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

2. **Salary Increase:**
   John's original weekly salary is $2000. The award provides a 5% raise in his salary.
   \[
   \text{Salary increase} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100
   \]
   Therefore, his new weekly salary is:
   \[
   2000 + 100 = 2100
   \]

3. **Total Weekly Earnings:**
   With the salary increase, John's total weekly earnings are:

"To determine the total number of cheese slices Carl used, we will break down the problem into parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich.
   - Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week.
   - He used 8 slices of cheese in the big dish.
   - Total cheese slices for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we sum up all the cheese slices used:
\[ 10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the total number of cheese slices Carl used is:

"To determine the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we need to calculate the kilometers for each period separately and then sum them up.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the first four weeks is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the next three weeks is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we start by calculating the weight of each type of candy. Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each candied apple weighs half as much, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Joe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

"To find the cost of each cup, we start by understanding the given information. The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000, and this is $1200 more than the total cost of twenty dozen cups. Let's denote the cost of one cup as \( x \).

First, we calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups:
\[ \text{Total cost of twenty dozen cups} = 240x \]

According to the problem, this total cost is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates:
\[ 240x = 36000 - 1200 \]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[ 240x = 34800 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{34800}{240} \]

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we start by calculating the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20, with 2 pairs needed. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Sara already has $10 saved. The additional amount she needs to earn is:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Sara earns $4 for each time she mows the lawn. Let \( x \) be the number of times she needs to mow the lawn. The equation to find \( x \) is:

\[ 4x = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

Given the conditions:
1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs per day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs per day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which translates to \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:
\[ r = 4 \]

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify:
- Number of white chickens \( w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \)
- Total eggs per day: \( 3r + 5w = 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \)

The calculations confirm the solution. The number of red chickens Jerry has is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine how long it takes Gary to walk this distance. We know his walking speed is 3 miles per hour. The time \( t \) it takes to walk a certain distance \( d \) at a speed \( v \) is given by:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and his speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers on the first day, which is given as 100.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day, which is 50 more than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
   \[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
   \[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is:

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the given conditions. Let \( S \) represent the current amount of water in the small pool and \( B \) represent the current amount of water in the big pool.

From the problem, we know:
1. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This translates to:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Setting these equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first calculate the total cost of the items. The cost of the shoes is $320.00, and the cost of the belt is $32.00. Adding these together gives:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we start by calculating the total amount she promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional 10% is calculated as follows:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

Adding this to the original amount, the total amount she promised to return is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 2040 \]

Now, we find the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:

\[ 2200 - 2040 = 160 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we start with the number of roses, which is 4. Given that there are 7 more dahlias than roses, the number of dahlias is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Adding the number of roses and dahlias together gives the total number of flowers:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their average age in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Harriet's age in 3 years} = 21 + 3 = 24
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Zack's age in 3 years} = 42 + 3 = 45
     \]
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Adrian's age in 3 years} = 63 + 3 = 66
     \]

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   The average age is the sum of their ages in three years divided by 3:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in 3 years} + \text{Zack's age in 3 years} + \text{Adrian's age in 3 years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3}

"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we start by calculating the points scored by Yuri and Brianna based on the points scored by Naomi.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we sum the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

Given that the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's score by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

Therefore, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To determine the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles separately, and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\[
\text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is:

"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we start by calculating the amount spent in the second year. Given that the company spent $15000 on advertising in the first year and then spent a third of that amount in the second year, we calculate the second year's expenditure as follows:

\[
\text{Amount spent in the second year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000
\]

Next, we add the amounts spent in the first and second years to find the total expenditure over the two years:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is:

"To determine how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we start with the total number of watermelons produced, which is 120.

First, we calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the watermelons were ready, we have:
\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]
This means 36 watermelons were ready and Ashlyn took them home. Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining is:
\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]
This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest. Consequently, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Thus, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."

"To determine how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we start with the total number of penguins, which is 36. 

Next, we calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean. Since one-third of the penguins jump in, we perform the following calculation:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Then, we calculate the number of penguins that go into the cave. Again, one-third of the penguins go into the cave:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

To find the total number of penguins that leave the snow, we add the penguins that jump into the ocean and those that go into the cave:
\[
12 + 12 = 24
\]

Finally, to find the number of penguins still sunbathing, we subtract the total number of penguins that leave the snow from the initial total:
\[
36 - 24 = 12
\]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we start by calculating the total weekly intake of tomatoes for both Steve and his girlfriend. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half of that, which is 3 tomatoes per day. Therefore, their combined daily intake is:

"Mike was initially pen pals with 5 people. After stopping being pen pals with 2 of them, he has 3 pen pals left. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 3 pen pals in kind, so he also sends 30 pages a week. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we first convert the total number of pages into minutes:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we convert the total minutes into hours:

"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we start by calculating the total minutes he has used. Jason makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day, and there are 30 days in the month. Therefore, the total minutes used for these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used an extra 300 minutes for calls to other people. Adding these together gives the total minutes used:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the plan's allowance:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's follow the steps methodically:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. According to the problem, in the end Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much each person paid, we first calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on the party supplies. The costs are as follows:
- Ingredients for the cake: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

We sum these amounts to find the total cost:
\[
12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96

Isabelle split the total cost evenly among her three parents. Therefore, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[
\frac{96}{3} = 32
\]

Thus, each person paid \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"To determine the total cost the chef spent on onions, we start by calculating the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost. Given that a pound of onions costs $1.50, the cost for 200 pounds is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the chef spent:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we start by calculating the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

First, we find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate:
- On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 cookies.

So, the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate is:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, which is \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, which is \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \) cookies.

Thus, the total number of cookies Sue ate is:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie contains 200 calories. Therefore, the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister are:
- Sue's total calories: \( 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \)
- Sue's sister's total calories: \( 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \)

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is:
\[ 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

Thus, Sue consumed \(\boxed{5600}\) more calories than her sister."
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students in the school:**
   Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes.
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 3 = 60
   \]

2. **Determine the number of boys and girls in the school:**
   The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \text{Number of girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. **Find out how many girls are in the third class:**
   We know the number of girls in the first and second classes:
   - First class: 15 girls
   - Second class: 12 girls
   Let \( G_3 \) be the number of girls in the third class. The total number of girls in the school is the sum of the girls in all three classes:
   \[
   15 + 12 + G_3 = 30
   \]
   Solving for \( G_3 \):
   \[
   27 + G_3 = 30 \implies G_3 = 30 - 27 = 3
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of boys in the third class:**
   Since the total number of students in the third class is 20 and there are 3 girls:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys in the third class} = 20 - 3 = 17
   \]

Thus, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"To determine the total number of animals Rick killed, we start by identifying the number of animals killed each night and today.

1. **Last Night:**
   - Wolves killed: \( w_1 = 10 \)
   - Cougars killed: \( c_1 = 15 \)

2. **Today:**
   - Wolves killed: \( w_2 = 3c_2 \)
   - Cougars killed: \( c_2 = c_1 - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 \)
   - Therefore, \( w_2 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \)

Next, we sum up the total number of animals killed:
- Wolves killed last night: \( 10 \)
- Cougars killed last night: \( 15 \)
- Wolves killed today: \( 36 \)
- Cougars killed today: \( 12 \)

Total number of animals killed:
\[ 10 + 15 + 36 + 12 = 73 \]

Thus, the total number of animals Rick killed is \(\boxed{73}\)."

"To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we start with the information given:

1. Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.
2. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. This means Anne went down the slide \(30 - (0.30 \times 30) = 30 - 9 = 21\) times.
3. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne. Therefore, Robert went down the slide \(4 \times 21 = 84\) times.

Thus, the number of times Robert went down the water slide is 84. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, totaling 200 cows. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, increasing the total to 240 cows. These 40 cows are then evenly distributed among the 20 stalls, with each stall receiving 2 cows.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we calculate the number of cows in one stall and then multiply by 8. Since each stall has 2 cows, the number of cows in 8 stalls is:

\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \]

Thus, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill separately and then sum them up.

   - Brady has 40 pieces of dollar bills.
   - Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.
   - Total value of dollar bills: \( 40 \times 1.00 = 40.00 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the values of all the coins and dollar bills:

\[
1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank is \(\boxed{45.00}\) dollars."
"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten, we start by calculating the total weight of the entire tree before any damage. Given that each 10-foot section of the tree weighs 400 pounds and the tree is 200 feet tall, we can find the total weight as follows:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we account for the damage caused by the termites, which ate 30% of the tree's wood. This means 70% of the wood remains. We calculate the remaining weight as:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30) = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

\[

"To determine the total amount Nancy has to pay, we start by calculating the cost of the overdue books. Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books, so the cost for the books is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ \boxed{6.00} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the information given:

- Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
- Let \( J_b \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.
- Andrea has 52 apples, which is 8 more than Jamal, so \( A_a = J_a + 8 = 52 \). Solving for \( J_a \), we get \( J_a = 44 \).
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so \( J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \).
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \).

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168. \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine the total cups of flour Carla will need, we start by calculating the total number of cookies she is making. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is:

\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we know that 2 cups of flour are required to make 12 cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we set up the following proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

\]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we start by calculating the number of pennies in the stack. Given that there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we need to find two thirds of this amount:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = 9300 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6200
\]

Next, we convert the number of pennies in the stack to dollars. Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = \frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\boxed{62}
\]"

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 270."
"To determine how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we start by calculating the number of trees each person has.

First, we know that Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has:
\[
\text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has:
\[
\text{Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has} = 2 \times 3 = 6
\]
\[
\text{Number of trees Harry has} = 6 + 5 = 11
\]

To find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
\[
\text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

Therefore, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"To find out how much money all three girls have combined, we start by calculating the individual amounts:

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has \(100 + 25 = 125\) dollars.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has \(125 + 50 = 175\) dollars.

Next, we sum the amounts of money each girl has:
\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is \(\boxed{400}\)."
"To determine how much more the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total price including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then subtract her budget.

1. **Calculate the Brokerage Fee**:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

2. **Calculate the Transfer Fee**:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

3. **Calculate the Total Price Including Fees**:

Therefore, the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget by $9,500.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for all expenses and the loan repayment. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   The total expenses include the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale:**
   The net proceeds from the sale of the house is the selling price minus the total expenses.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds from sale} = 400,000 - 32,000 = 368,000
   \]

5. **Subtract the loan repayment:**
   Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = 368,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
   \]

Thus, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is:
\[
\boxed{118000}

- Number of newspaper ads = 50
- Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
- Cost per television ad = $75
- Number of television ads = 15
- Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = $250 + $1125 = $1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads. The final numerical answer is $1375."
"To determine the number of blue golf balls, we start with the total number of balls, which is 16. Since half of these balls are golf balls, we calculate the number of golf balls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of golf balls} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
\]

Next, we know that half of these golf balls are blue. Therefore, we calculate the number of blue golf balls as:

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
     \[
     6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}
     \]

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives:
     \[
     12 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 8 \text{ windows (additional)} = 20 \text{ windows}
     \]

Thus, the total number of windows between the two houses is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the change the mother receives, we first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. The costs are as follows:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we start by analyzing the given information:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
- The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Next, we calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
\[
90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 270 \text{ stitches}
\]

Subtracting the stitches used for the collar and the rosette from the total stitches gives us the number of stitches used for the sleeves:
\[
1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches}
\]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
\[
\frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches per sleeve}
\]

Thus, each sleeve takes \(\boxed{765}\) stitches."
"To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.

\[
\text{Total cost of tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.

\[
\text{Total cost of celery seeds} = 80 \times 30 = 2400 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we start by calculating the time required for each type of hole separately.

First, we calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

\[
\text{Time for small holes} = 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

\[
\text{Time for large holes} = 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time for both types of holes:

\[
\text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.

Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ R = 6S \]

From the second piece of information, in 9 years:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Substitute \( R = 6S \) into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To find the final answer, we start by determining the number of spots a mamba has. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots a mamba has, we calculate the number of spots a mamba has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of spots a mamba has} = \frac{70}{2} = 35
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[
\text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800
\]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[
\text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100
\]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[
\text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900
\]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[
\text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2450}

"To determine the total cost Maddy will spend on pizza, we first calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game. This includes the team members, coaches, and their guests.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Each pizza serves 3 people, so the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Since each pizza costs $15, the total cost is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Maddy will spend is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we start by calculating the total length used by the topaz gemstones and then find out how much space is left for the sterling silver beads.

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \).

2. **Calculate the total length of the space between the topaz gemstones:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length used by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Length available for sterling silver beads = \( 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \).

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = \( \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \).

Thus, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

"To determine how many cents Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop, we start by calculating the total amount of money she has. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so the total value of the quarters is:

\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Each dime is worth 10 cents, so the total value of the dimes is:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:

\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has:

\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the number of cents Kelly will have left is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars and then subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars.

1. The total number of stars on the flag is 76.
2. The number of stars in the rows of 8 stars is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).
3. The number of stars in the rows of 6 stars is \(2 \times 6 = 12\).
4. The total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars is \(24 + 12 = 36\).
5. The number of stars in the rows of 5 stars is \(76 - 36 = 40\).
6. The number of rows of 5 stars is \(\frac{40}{5} = 8\).

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the time the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles, we start with the speed of the car in the slow lane, which is half the speed of the car in the fast lane. The car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour, so the car in the slow lane travels at:

\[
\text{Speed of the car in the slow lane} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the fast lane car to travel this distance using the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to travel the same 480 miles:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

"Ali has won 22 medals for counting super fast. His friend Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals. Together, Ali and Izzy have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals. The problem states that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This implies that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the sum of Ali and Izzy's medals. Therefore, the total number of medals given out is \(39 \times 10 = 390\).

The total number of medals given out for counting is \(\boxed{390}\)."
"To determine how many chocolate bars each child will get, we start by calculating the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets, each containing 5 chocolate bars:

\[
8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the 4 adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars:

\[
4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

Subtracting the chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars leaves us with:

\[
40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

These remaining 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the 8 children:

\[
\frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child}
\]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"Let's break down the problem step by step with a clearer and more concise approach.

1. **Determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Check if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round:**
   - Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

3. **Calculate the total points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike's total points: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
   - Jim's total points: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
   - Tony's total points: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

4. **Sum the total points of all three players:**
   \[
   21 + 18 + 43 = 82

- Dumbbell presses: 60
- Total: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

Therefore, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is **370**."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we start by calculating the daily rice consumption for the household. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 members who eat at both lunch and dinner. Therefore, the daily consumption is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:

\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Finally, to find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total bag weight by the weekly consumption:

\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. The correct answer is:

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first calculate the total crates sold during the week he was open. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so he only sold bread on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

The crates sold each day are:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Adding these together gives:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:

"To determine the total amount Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to sum up all her bids. Carmen's bids form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 200\) and the common difference \(d = 50\). The number of terms \(n\) in the sequence is 100 (since she bids 100 times).

The formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

For the 100th term:
\[ a_{100} = 200 + (100-1) \cdot 50 = 200 + 99 \cdot 50 = 200 + 4950 = 5150 \]

The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ S_{100} = \frac{100}{2} (200 + 5150) = 50 \cdot 5350 = 267500 \]

Therefore, the total amount Carmen paid for the antique desk is $267,500.

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of books sold in the second year.
2. Multiply the number of books sold in the second year by the price per book.

Given:
- Total books: 250
- Unsold books: 50
- Books sold this year: 45
- Books sold in the first year: \(2 \times 45 = 90\)

The total number of books sold over the three years is:
\[ 90 \text{ (first year)} + 45 \text{ (this year)} + 200 \text{ (second year)} = 335 \]

Since the total number of books is 250, the books sold in the second year must be:
\[ 250 - (90 + 45) = 250 - 135 = 115 \]

Now, calculate the earnings from the second year:
\[ 115 \text{ books} \times 20 \text{ dollars/book} = 2300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is:

"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well, we need to add this bonus to his weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings with bonus} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \]

Since Watson earns weekly, we consider only full weeks in April. Therefore, we consider 4 full weeks in April.

\[ \text{Total earnings for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 800 \, \text{\$/week} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Since the company performed very well for the whole month, Watson also receives the $300 bonus for each of the 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total bonus for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 1200 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we add his total earnings from his hourly wage and the total bonus to find his total earnings for April.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 3200 \, \text{\$} + 1200 \, \text{\$} = 4400 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:

\[ \boxed{4400} \]"
"John arm wrestled 20 people. He beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he lost to, we first calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. Therefore, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, the number of people John lost to is 4. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we start with the total production of 60 loaves each day. Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

After the morning sales, the remaining loaves are:

\[
\text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we start by calculating Joey's weekly weight loss. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weekly weight loss is:

\[ \text{Weekly weight loss by Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds in total. Given that Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the savings, we need to calculate the difference in cost for both the ice cream and the milk when bought at the original prices versus the discounted prices.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the discount is the same for each packet, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5
- Savings on one packet of milk: $0.5

Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

The final numerical answer is:
\[

   - The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - We need to find out how many times 3 days fit into 15 days.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \)
   - Therefore, the person will grow 5 extra arms in 15 days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - We need to find out how many times 5 days fit into 15 days.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \)
   - Therefore, the person will grow 3 extra legs in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs.
   - Calculation: \( 5 + 3 = 8 \)

"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we start by calculating the total cost of the items he has already bought:

1. **Cost of business suits**: 
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

2. **Cost of suitcases**: 
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

3. **Cost of the flight ticket**: 
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Next, we sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on other items (business suits, suitcases, flight ticket, and gifts) is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Subtracting the cost of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the total amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we start by calculating the daily egg consumption.

1. **Daily Egg Consumption Calculation:**
   - Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
   - The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
   - Therefore, the total daily egg consumption for the family is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

2. **Weekly Egg Consumption Calculation:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed in a week is \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Thus, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"To determine Trent's age, we start with the information provided:

1. Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, Jane's age is:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane. Therefore, Trent's age is:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Thus, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"To find the current population of Chile, let's go through the steps again with a clearer focus:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Relate the population of Chile six years ago to Noah's age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).

5. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - So, \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

6. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Since the population of Chile six years ago was 120000, the current population is \(120000 \times 2 = 240000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{240000}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) and the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine the number of people who showed up for Martha's party, we start by calculating the total number of people initially invited:

- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, which totals \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which totals \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

Adding these together, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness, which is 8 people.

Then, we account for the people who couldn't come due to previous commitments, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Finally, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people showed up for the party:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

Thus, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is:
\[\boxed{14}\]"
"To find the total weight of the marbles Solomon has, we start by calculating the total number of marbles he possesses. Solomon initially had 50 marbles in the store. He then bought 20 more marbles from Johanna, bringing the total to:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ marbles} \]

His father then gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times the number of marbles he bought from Johanna. The number of marbles his father gave him is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles} \]

Adding these to the marbles he already had:

\[ 70 + 8 = 78 \text{ marbles} \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles is:

\[ 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is:

\[
\boxed{156}

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find the total number of children in the classroom, we start with the given information:

- There are 30 boys.
- The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys, so the number of girls is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
- The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys, so the number of nongendered children is \(30 / 10 = 3\).

Adding these together gives the total number of children:
\[
\text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
\]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can set up the following relationship based on the ratio:

\[ \frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Given \( W = 45 \), we substitute this value into the ratio equation:

\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:

\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To determine the number of women left at the party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of people:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total people initially: \(25 + 15 = 40\)

2. **After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left:**
   - Number of people who left: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)
   - Number of people remaining: \(40 - 10 = 30\)

3. **Given that 22 men stayed at the party:**
   - Number of men who left: \(25 - 22 = 3\)
   - Number of women who left: \(10 - 3 = 7\) (since 10 people left in total and 3 were men, the rest must be women)

4. **Number of women remaining:**
   - Initial number of women: 15
   - Number of women who left: 7
   - Number of women remaining: \(15 - 7 = 8\)

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we start by determining the cost of the magazine. Given that the magazine costs half as much as a book and the book costs $4, we calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the cost of the magazine. Therefore, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Thus, the cost of the pen is $1. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"To determine the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we first calculate the total number of pencils Jam has. Given that Jam has 26 pencils in total, which includes 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, we can confirm that each box contains 8 pencils.

Next, we add the pencils Meg has to the total:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to find out how many boxes are required to store 72 pencils, with each box holding 8 pencils:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of cooling and the addition of cream separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters, but it does add 15 milliliters to the total volume of the drink. However, the question asks how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, not how much stronger the drink is. Therefore, the addition of cream does not affect the milliliters weaker calculation.

Thus, the total reduction in milliliters due to the cooling and the addition of cream is simply the reduction due to the cooling:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people, we start with the given trade ratio: 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. This means that for every 1 new record received, 2 old records are required.

Given that 5 people leave with 7 new records, we need to calculate the total number of old records required to obtain these 7 new records. Since 2 old records are needed for 1 new record, for 7 new records, the calculation is as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total number of old records the 5 people brought in is 14.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we start by determining the number of junior and senior programmers. Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

The number of senior programmers is then:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know the monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000. Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is:

\[ \text{Salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Now, we calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:

\[ \text{Total salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

And the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total monthly salary} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second bus stop is:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

According to the problem, after the second bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So we can set up the following equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first calculate the additional percentage of charging required. The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which is an additional 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

\[
\text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[
120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time required to fully charge the phone is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how much the customer paid for their shopping trip, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, the rewards earned are:
     \[
     \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their rewards on this shopping trip.
   - Since they earned 4 rewards, they used 4 rewards.
   - Each reward is worth $1 off the next purchase.

3. **Calculate the discount from the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.
   - Therefore, the discount from the coupon is:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon:**
   - The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip.
   - After using the rewards, the price becomes:
     \[
     43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Then, applying the coupon discount:
     \[

Thus, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we first calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A:
- Annual income before tax: $15 \times 2000 = $30,000
- State tax: $30,000 \times 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: $36,000 \times 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
- $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job. The final answer is $8,400."

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

Thus, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, with twice as many chickens as cows. Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). We know that:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, the number of cows is 20, and the number of chickens is:

\[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (4 \times 20) + (2 \times 40) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have is **160**."

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of each animal and then calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal.

1. **Weight of the pink frog:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of the pink frog} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Weight of the blue beetle:**
   Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle:
   \[
   \text{Weight of the blue beetle} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight of the green toad:**
   Since the pink frog weighs the same as the green toad:
   \[
   \text{Weight of the green toad} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Weight of the yellow snake:**
   The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake:
   \[
   \text{Weight of the yellow snake} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Weight of the red bird:**
   The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird:

"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors, we start by calculating the daily revenue for each scenario.

When making tractors:
- Daily revenue = Number of tractors sold per day * Revenue per tractor
- Daily revenue = 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day

Now, when making silos:
- Daily revenue = Number of silos sold per day * Revenue per silo
- Daily revenue = 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day

To find the percentage increase in daily revenue:
- Percentage increase = \(\frac{\text{New daily revenue} - \text{Old daily revenue}}{\text{Old daily revenue}} \times 100\%\)
- Percentage increase = \(\frac{1100 - 1000}{1000} \times 100\% = \frac{100}{1000} \times 100\% = 10\%\)

Therefore, the percentage increase in daily revenue is 10%."

"To determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we start with the total amount of money he has, which is $10. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. Let \( x \) represent the number of pounds of candy he bought. The total cost for the candy is \( 1.5x \).

After buying the candy, the change Billy has is \( 10 - 1.5x \). According to the problem, he spends half of this change on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each, and he buys 40 gumballs. Therefore, the amount spent on gumballs is \( 0.05 \times 40 = 2 \) dollars. This amount is half of his change, so the change is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.

We can set up the equation for the change:
\[
10 - 1.5x = 4
\]

Solving for \( x \):
\[
10 - 4 = 1.5x
\]
\[
6 = 1.5x

"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first calculate the total distance of one complete round trip. The distances are as follows:

- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trips, which is \(100 + 75 = 175\) miles, so \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles

The total distance for one complete round trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days}\]

To convert this into hours, we recognize that \(\frac{1}{20}\) of a day is equivalent to 12 hours (since \(\frac{1}{20} \times 24 = 1.2\) hours).

Therefore, the train goes between services every 12 hours. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we start by calculating the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. The collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. Given that a Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds, the average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for 3 collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds gives us the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is \(\boxed{23}\) pounds."
"To find the total time John's trip took, we need to calculate the time for each segment of his journey and then sum them up.

First, the time to drive to his friend's house is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, the time for the detour is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{21}{7} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Then, the time to drive back home is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{24}{8} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these times together gives the total trip time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time for the trip is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls were absent, so the number of girls present is:

\[ 43 - 5 = 38 \]

Since the total number of fourth-graders is 96, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 96 - 38 = 58 - 4 = 54 \]

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

The total number of kids in the park is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) be the score she needs on her third test. The equation representing the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"

"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we start by understanding the information given:

1. Sara scored 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara.

First, calculate the points Erin has after scoring 14 points:
\[ \text{Points Sara has} = 8 \]
\[ \text{Points Erin has after scoring 14 points} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Next, since Erin scored 14 points to reach 24 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from the total points she has now to find out how many points she had before:
\[ \text{Points Erin had before} = 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we will calculate the expenses for each component separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost, making the total cost per frame $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $24.
   - With 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:

   15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg}
   \]
4. **Other half of the sheep providing milk**: The other half of the 30 sheep will provide milk. This is also:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ sheep}
   \]
5. **Milk from the other half of the sheep**: Each of these 15 sheep provides 2 kg of milk per day. Therefore, the total milk from these 15 sheep is:
   \[
   15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg}
   \]
6. **Total milk collected per day**: We add the milk from both halves of the sheep:
   \[
   15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:
\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine how many pupils like the color yellow, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of pupils**: 40

2. **Pupils who like blue**:
   \[
   \text{Number of pupils who like blue} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20
   \]

3. **Remaining pupils after those who like blue**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]

4. **Pupils who like green**:
   \[
   \text{Number of pupils who like green} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]

5. **Pupils who like yellow**:
   \[
   \text{Number of pupils who like yellow} = \text{Remaining pupils} - \text{Pupils who like green} = 20 - 5 = 15
   \]

Thus, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"To determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she received $56 from selling them at $4 per apple. Therefore, the number of apples sold on Monday is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]

4. To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we sum the apples picked on each day:
   \[
   \text{Total number of apples picked} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples}
   \]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we start with the total number of socks she has and subtract the number of socks she has washed.

Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which amounts to \(10 \times 2 = 20\) socks, and 15 loose socks. Therefore, the total number of socks she has washed is \(20 + 15 = 35\).

The number of socks she has missed is calculated by subtracting the number of washed socks from the total number of socks:
\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Thus, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Rachel initially had 23 cookies. After receiving 42 more from Janet, she had a total of:

\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest. The formula for the total amount to be paid, including interest, is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Months}} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (r) = 10% = 0.10
- Number of Months (n) = 5

First, we calculate the total amount to be paid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5884.4115 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5884.4115}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.8823 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.88 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is \(\boxed{1176.88}\)."
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we first calculate the distance each person hiked.

For Cho:
- Speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

For Chloe:
- Speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 67 \]"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we start by calculating the number of each type of peso they possess.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which is \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Next, we sum the silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Then, we sum the gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Adding the total number of silver and gold pesos gives us:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we start by calculating the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells 36 cups at $1 per cup, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of making the lemonade from the total revenue to find the profit:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all the lemonade. Since she sells 4 cups per hour, the time to sell 36 cups is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2/\text{hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the total amount of land Mr. Ruther initially had, we start with the information that he sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, leaving him with \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land, which is 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \(x\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{5}{2}\):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Simplifying the right side:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

Thus, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we start by calculating the number of girls in the choir. Given that the choir has 52 members and 50% are girls, the number of girls is:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
\]

Since the choir performs only with its female members, the number of female members who can perform is half of 26:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

On the day of the performance, half of these female members can't make it due to their bus breaking down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{13}{2} = 6.5
\]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, we consider the practical scenario where we take the integer part, which is 6. However, the problem states that 3 teachers decide to sing with them, so we add these 3 teachers to the 6 female members who can perform:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 6 + 3 = 9
\]

Thus, the correct number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\boxed{9}

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests (which is 5) to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The correct option is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can calculate the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils separately and then add them together.

The cost of one eraser is $2, so the cost of 6 erasers is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

The cost of one pencil is $3, so the cost of 8 pencils is:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Adding the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils together gives:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"

"Given the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can determine the number of popsicles each has by setting up the following equations based on the ratio and the total:

Let \( B \) represent the number of popsicles Betty has, and \( S \) represent the number of popsicles Sam has. The ratio \( B:S = 5:6 \) can be expressed as \( B = 5k \) and \( S = 6k \) for some constant \( k \). The total number of popsicles is given by:

\[ B + S = 165 \]

Substituting \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( k \):

\[ 5k + 6k = 165 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 11k = 165 \]

Solving for \( k \):

\[ k = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( S \):

\[ B = 5k = 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
\[ S = 6k = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty:

\[ S - B = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"To determine the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we first need to convert all time spent into the same unit, which we will use minutes.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours
  \[
  4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent recording the song: half of the time spent writing it
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes

Next, we sum up the total time spent on all activities:
\[
240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing. The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{450 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

Then calculate the percentage:

"To determine the total number of Valentine's cards Erica has, we start by summing up all the cards she possesses initially and then account for the cards she has passed out and received.

First, Erica made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with each box containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards her dad brought is:
\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Adding these together, the total number of cards Erica has before any are passed out or received is:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, we account for the cards that were passed out and received:
- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find the net change in the number of cards Erica has, we subtract the cards passed out and add the cards received:
\[ 50 - 24 + 17 \]

Performing the arithmetic step-by-step:
\[ 50 - 24 = 26 \]
\[ 26 + 17 = 43 \]

5. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of meat} + \text{Cost of cheese} = 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of cannolis:** Allan starts with 40 cannolis.
2. **After buying more cannolis:** Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the total number of cannolis becomes:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]
3. **Initial number of corns:** Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis initially, the number of corns is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]
4. **After buying fewer corns:** Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying more, so the number of corns becomes:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]
5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis:** Adding the number of corns and cannolis together, we get:
   \[
   60 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 160
   \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is \(\boxed{160}\)."
"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. **Steps from School and Home**: He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Therefore, the number of steps he took from school and home is:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]
3. **Additional Steps**: He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total number of steps taken before his jog is:
   \[
   5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]
4. **Remaining Steps**: After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
   \[
   10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2000}

"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we first calculate the total time it takes for Toby to read the book. The book is 45 pages long, and each page contains 200 words. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Thus, the time it takes for Toby to read the entire book is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, he needs to finish reading the book 50 minutes before he needs to leave the airport. Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

early.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (since May has 31 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May:
     \[
     40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in May:
     \[
     6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)

4. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \(40 - 10 = 30\)
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (since June has 30 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June:
     \[
     30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in June:
     \[
     4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in both May and June:**
   - Total amount paid in May: $96000
   - Total amount paid in June: $72000
   - Total amount paid in both months:
     \[
     96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{168000}\)."
"To determine how much money Sally has left, we first calculate the total cost of her purchases. The taffy is sold in a special deal where for every 2 pounds, she pays $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound. Since Sally bought 2 pounds, the cost for the taffy is:

\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, the cost for the seashells is:

\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \]

And the cost for the magnets is:

\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total expenditure:

\[ 4.50 + 6.00 + 1.00 = 11.50 \]

Since Sally's parents gave her $10, the amount of money she has left is:

\[ 10.00 - 11.50 = -1.50 \]

Therefore, Sally is short by $1.50. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{-1.50}
\]"
"Tim decides to light off some fireworks for the fourth of July. He buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much. He gets a 20% discount on them. He also buys a finale firework that costs $150. How much did he spend in total?

First, calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks:
- The first pack costs $400.
- The second pack costs $800 (twice the first pack).

The total cost of the two packs before the discount is:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, apply the 20% discount on the total cost of the fireworks:
\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks:
\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, add the cost of the finale firework:
\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:
\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon makes her own madeleine cookies and eats 2 a night as a treat. She wants to make enough cookies to last her for 30 days by storing them in the freezer. Her recipe makes 1 dozen madeleine cookies.

To determine how many dozens of cookies she needs to make for 30 days, we first calculate the total number of cookies she will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, we then find out how many dozens are needed for 60 cookies:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days.

The final numerical answer is 5 dozens."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know the following:

- 95% of the candles are safe and do not explode.
- 5% of the candles are dangerous and have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- 1% of the dangerous candles explode (since 5% of the candles are dangerous and 1% of those are guaranteed to explode).

First, we calculate the number of dangerous candles:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we determine how many of these dangerous candles will explode:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles that explode} = 1\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.01 \times 2500 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we start by calculating the sale price of each blouse after the 30% discount. The regular price of each blouse is $20. The discount amount per blouse is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

Subtracting the discount amount from the regular price gives the sale price per blouse:

\[ \text{Sale price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we start by defining the variables and using the information provided in the problem.

Joanne gathers:
- 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
- \( A_{\text{avg}} \) apples from the average trees.

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 60 apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 45 apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the equations derived from the given information:

1. The total number of heads is 180, which gives us the equation:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

2. The total number of humps is 304, with camels having 2 humps and dromedaries having 1 hump, leading to the equation:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

We can solve this system of equations by elimination. Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we will break down the distances traveled each day and sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:

\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"Given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and it is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, we can find the volume of Zack's locker by multiplying Peter's locker volume by 4:
\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can find the volume of Timothy's locker by multiplying Zack's locker volume by 2:
\[ \text{Volume of Timothy's locker} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches. The correct answer is:
\[ 40 \]"

"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from both banks, we start by calculating the amount received from the second bank. Since the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000, the amount from the second bank is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we find the total amount of money received from both banks by adding the amounts from each bank:

\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Now, we add this total to his initial capital of $5000 to find his new total capital:

\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the final amount of capital Mr. Josue has now is:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats each carried away 5 cats, so a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. This leaves \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats. Later, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 30 cats ran away, which is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\) cats. Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods and sum them up.

1. **First 6 months:**
   - The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for 6 months = \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \) dollars.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8):**
   - The cost is $12 per month.
   - Total cost for 2 months = \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Next 10 months (months 9 to 18):**
   - The cost is $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 10 months = \( 10 \times 14 = 140 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
48 + 24 + 140 = 212
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\boxed{212}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the costs of the jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which means the jogger jeans cost $22.

Cole saved a total of $6, with \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings coming from the jogger jeans and the remaining \( \frac{2}{3} \) from the tattered jeans. This means he saved $2 from the jogger jeans and $4 from the tattered jeans.

The original cost of the jogger jeans was $22, and the tattered jeans cost $28. The difference in cost between the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the number of bird feeders and the number of birds each type of feeder attracts.

1. Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself, and she buys 3 more from the store, making a total of 6 bird feeders.
2. Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds per day.
3. Each of the bird feeders Lillian made herself attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds per day.

Now, we calculate the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day:
- The 3 store-bought bird feeders attract \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds per day.
- The 3 bird feeders Lillian made herself attract \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds per day.

Adding these together, the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day is \(60 + 90 = 150\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we will calculate the cost of each item step by step.

1. **Cost of the Bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Cost of the Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. First, we calculate 25% of $4:
   \[
   0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   Adding this to the cost of the bagel:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]
   So, the soup costs $5.
3. **Cost of the Cake**: The cake is half the price of the bagel:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]
   Thus, the cake costs $2.

"To determine the total number of cards Kenny started with, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards at $1.5 each, and he ends up with $50 after buying a ticket that costs $100. This means he has $50 left after the ticket purchase, which is the amount he earned from selling the cards.

The total money he earns from selling the cards is:
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) \times 1.5 = x \]

Since he has $50 left after buying the ticket, the total money he earned from selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the ticket). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 100 \]

Thus, the total number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the interpretation. Given that he ends up with $50 after buying the ticket, the total money he earned from selling the cards should be $150 (since $100 for the ticket + $50 spending cash = $150). Therefore, the correct equation is:
\[ x = 150 \]

So, the correct number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of guests who would have eaten two hotdogs if everyone had only eaten one:**
   - There are 36 guests, and half of them would have eaten two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).
   - So, 18 guests would have eaten two hotdogs each.

2. **Calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared:**
   - 18 guests would have eaten 2 hotdogs each, so \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - This means the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs.

3. **Determine the number of guests who actually wanted a second hotdog:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog.
   - Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, 4 hotdogs were left unprepared.

4. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - Out of the 40 guests, 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we start by noting that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is:

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Next, we sum the money Dora currently has:
- Money from allowance: $2
- Money from mother: $16

Total money Dora has:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs an additional $1 to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball. The final answer is:

"To determine the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce, we will follow the given information step by step.

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters of the dragons slain by Prince Thaddeus. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Walter slew is:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine how much gas Josey needed, we start by calculating the amount of gas in each container. Given that 15 gallons of gas are divided equally into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \text{Gas in each container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, which translates to:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, the amount of gas needed in pints is:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Money Spent and Left:**
   George spent $5 and had 1% left, which means he spent $4.95 on items.

2. **Cost of Chips:**
   Each bag of chips costs $0.40. If George bought 3 bags of chips, the total cost for chips is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}

3. **Money Left After Chips:**
   Subtract the cost of chips from the total spent:
   \[
   4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Candy Bars:**
   Each candy bar costs $0.75. The remaining $3.75 is spent on candy bars:
   \[
   \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \text{ candy bars}
   \]

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is \(\boxed{5}\)."

   \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving}
   \]

Thus, the cost per serving is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to arrive at the theater first, we start by noting the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time it takes Wayne to drive to the theater from the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater:

\[
\text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} - \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 16 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = 12 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start with the given area and length. The area of the room is 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards, which converts to 9 feet.

First, we use the area formula for a rectangle to find the width:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we calculate the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet. The correct answer is:

"To determine the final temperature of the house, we follow these steps:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.
2. **Temperature Increase from Oven**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
   - Total temperature increase from the oven = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.
3. **Temperature Decrease from Window**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Time the window is open = 30 minutes.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.
   - Total temperature decrease from the window = 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.
   - Final temperature after the window is closed = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

Thus, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"To determine the time it took James to do the run, we start by calculating the time James took for each segment of the triathlon based on the given information.

First, we calculate the time James took for the swim:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time James took for the bike ride:
\[ 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( R \) be the time James took for the run. The total time James took for the triathlon is:
\[ 36 \text{ minutes} + 85 \text{ minutes} + R = 121 + R \text{ minutes} \]

Given that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, the total time Jon took is 170 minutes. Therefore, the total time James took is:
\[ 170 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine the profit, we first calculate the cost price per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[
\text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each on Monday:

\[
\text{Revenue from Monday sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
\]

The remaining sneakers sold to the department store are:

\[
48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
\]

The revenue from the department store selling these 31 sneakers at $25 each is:

\[
\text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the revenues from both sales gives the total revenue:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total cost for 48 sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[
\text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

Given that the super ticket costs $20 and includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1, the total cost for the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and soda separately:
\[ 21 = 15 + P - 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 21 = 13 + P \]
\[ P = 21 - 13 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

Thus, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original cost per balloon:**
   - The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   - Therefore, the cost per balloon was:
     \[
     \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the new cost per balloon after the price increase:**
   - The cost per balloon increased by $20.
   - Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
     \[
     \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - The cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - First, break down the multiplication:
     \[
     170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
     \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     \[
     170 \times 60 = 10200
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 5 = 850
     \]
   - Add the results:
     \[
     10200 + 850 = 11050

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:

1. For the first segment:
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \( 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \)

2. For the second segment:
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \( 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \)

Next, we add the distances to find the total distance:
\[ 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we calculate the total time taken:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is \( 50 \, \text{mph} \)."

3. Similarly, Nancy also eats \(4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}\).
4. Therefore, together they eat \(120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples}\).

The total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To determine the cost of the potting soil for Bob's raised beds, we first calculate the volume of one raised bed. Each raised bed has dimensions of 8 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of potting soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of each type of card:

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. Therefore, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15:
   \[
   \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24
   \]
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]

Next, we sum up the number of cards of all mentioned colors:
\[
\text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The total cost for both items is $7. Theo gave the cashier $10. The change she received is:

\[
10 - 7 = 3
\]

Thus, the amount of change Theo received is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To solve the problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year:**
   - Each of the 30 students started with 10 pencils.
   - Total pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Determine the number of pencils used after two months:**
   - After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 pencils = 60 pencils.

3. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months:**
   - Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
   - Remaining pencils = 300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils.

4. **Determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * Remaining pencils
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 pencils = 80 pencils.

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

The final answer is \(\boxed{80}\)."

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we start by converting the shark's length from feet to inches. Since the shark is 10 feet long and 1 foot equals 12 inches, the shark's length in inches is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find what percentage of the shark's body length (120 inches) the combined length of the remoras (12 inches) represents, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by understanding that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home, which means one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. Given that 20 students do not have desktop computers, we can set up the equation as follows:

"To determine how long Jason needs to spend walking each day, we start by calculating the total number of days he will walk in three weeks. Since three weeks is equal to 21 days, and he plans to walk 4 days a week, the total number of days he will walk is 21 days.

Jason needs to walk a total of 240 minutes to break in the shoes. Therefore, we need to divide the total minutes needed by the total number of days he will walk:

\[
\text{Minutes per day} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{21 \text{ days}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\text{Minutes per day} = \frac{240}{21} \approx 11.428571428571429
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, we get:

\[
\text{Minutes per day} \approx 11.43

"To determine the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we start by calculating the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. This can be found using the principle of inclusion and exclusion:

\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \]

Given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ |A \cup B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

\[ 32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total number of people going on the tour, we need to sum the number of employees and the number of tour guides.

First, we calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.
- Each group has 200 employees.

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides:
- There are 3 groups of tour guides.
- Each group has 7 tour guides.

\[
\text{Total number of tour guides} = 3 \times 7 = 21
\]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:

\[
\text{Total number of people} = \text{Total number of employees} + \text{Total number of tour guides} = 600 + 21 = 621
\]

The total number of people going on the tour is **621**."
"To determine the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we'll break down the expenses step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since each plane ticket costs $5000 and there are two tickets, the total cost for the plane tickets is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of the hotel. Normally, the hotel costs $1500 per day. However, because it is a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive. Therefore, the cost per day at the hotel is:
\[ 1500 + (0.20 \times 1500) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

"To determine how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player compared to Gabriel, we start by calculating the number of songs each has already stored on their portable media players.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Since each player can store up to 100 songs, the number of songs Gabriel can still add is:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Therefore, the number of songs Luri has is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

The number of songs Luri can still add to his player is:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

Thus, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his. The final numerical answer is:
\[

For the first venue, the total cost is \( 200 + 5n \).
For the second venue, the total cost is \( 25n \).

We set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Next, we solve for \( n \):
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20n \]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[ n = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

"Let's solve the problem step by step. We are given that together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. We also know that Lily found 7 more insects than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found. Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). Consequently, the number of insects found by Lily is \( D + 7 \), and the number of insects found by Bodhi is \( 2D \).

The total number of insects collected can be expressed as:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):
\[ D = 9 \]

Since David found 9 insects, the number of insects found by Lily, who found 7 more than David, is:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16. The correct answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we start by calculating the amount of yarn each used individually and then summing these amounts.

"To determine the length of the couch, we start with the given information:

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the width of the rug is:
   \[
   3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. First, we calculate twice the width of the rug:
   \[
   2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Adding 2 feet to this result gives us the length of the couch:
   \[
   16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet. The correct answer is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we start with the total cost equation given in the problem. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum, one pack of grape gum for $2, and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1. The total cost is $7.

The equation representing the total cost is:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 2 \]

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to evaluate the cost and yield of the wood he can purchase with his $24.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood Frederick can buy:
- Each 2 x 4 costs $4.
- With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{4} = 6 \) pieces of 2 x 4.

Each 2 x 4 piece yields 200 sticks, so:
- From 6 pieces of 2 x 4, he can get \( 6 \times 200 = 1200 \) sticks.

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood he can buy:
- Each 2 x 8 costs $6.
- With $24, he can buy \( \frac{24}{6} = 4 \) pieces of 2 x 8.

Each 2 x 8 piece yields 400 sticks, so:
- From 4 pieces of 2 x 8, he can get \( 4 \times 400 = 1600 \) sticks.

Since 1600 sticks from 2 x 8 pieces is more than 1200 sticks from 2 x 4 pieces, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is \(\boxed{1600}\)."

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass. Janet takes 2 bus trips each day and does this for 5 days a week, resulting in a total of \(2 \times 5 = 10\) bus trips per week. Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for the bus trips is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars. The weekly bus pass costs $20. Therefore, the savings by buying the bus pass is \(22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00\) dollars. 

Thus, Janet would save **$2.00** by buying the weekly bus pass."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo combined.

1. **Farm's Animals:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, and the zoo has 20 sheep. Therefore, the number of sheep on the farm is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
   - The total number of animals on the farm is \( 30 \text{ (cows)} + 10 \text{ (sheep)} = 40 \).

2. **Zoo's Animals:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, and since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) cows.
   - The total number of animals on the zoo is \( 60 \text{ (cows)} + 20 \text{ (sheep)} = 80 \).

3. **Combined Total:**
   - The total number of animals on the farm and the zoo combined is \( 40 + 80 = 120 \).

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start with the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Where \( S_o \) is the number of onions Sophia bought and \( S_p \) is the number of potatoes Sophia bought. Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Next, we solve for \( S_o + S_p \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pounds Andy needs to lose:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.

2. **Determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn:**
   Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of days Andy has until his goal:**
   Andy's goal is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the days from December 31st to July 19th.

   - **December:** 31 - 31 = 0 days (since December 31st is the last day of December)
   - **January:** 31 days
   - **February:** 28 days (2023 is not a leap year)
   - **March:** 31 days
   - **April:** 30 days
   - **May:** 31 days
   - **June:** 30 days
   - **July:** 19 days (up to July 19th)

   Adding these days together:
   \[
   0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 180 \text{ days}
   \]

4. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit:**
   To lose 105,000 calories in 180 days, Andy needs to burn:
   \[
   \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{180 \text{ days}} = 583.33 \text{ calories/day}

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Next, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Therefore, for 2 km, the total amount of water she needs to drink is:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Thus, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 120 ml."
"To determine how much money Julie has left after her expenditures, we start with the initial amount of $500.

First, Julie spends 20% of $500 on clothes:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]
So, after buying clothes, the remaining amount is:
\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, Julie spends 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]
Thus, after buying CDs, the remaining amount is:
\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we have:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the total cost equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we find:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 30,000 \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \), we get:

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{90000} \]"
"To determine Tara's profit, we start by calculating the total cost of the canvas bags she bought. She purchased 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so the total number of bags is:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack costs $4, so the total cost for the packs is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the canvas bags. She sold each bag for $8, so the total revenue is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Tara earned is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To determine the total number of punches Joe threw, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total duration of the fight in minutes.
2. Determine the total number of punches thrown by multiplying the average number of punches per minute by the total duration of the fight.

First, let's calculate the total duration of the fight:
- A fight lasts 5 rounds.
- Each round lasts 3 minutes.
- Therefore, the total duration of the fight is \( 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \).

Next, we calculate the total number of punches thrown:
- Joe throws 25 punches per minute.
- The fight lasts 15 minutes.
- Therefore, the total number of punches thrown is \( 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \).

The total number of punches Joe threw is \(\boxed{375}\)."
"To determine how many cookies Kelsie made, we start by finding out how many cookies Josh made. Given that Suzanne made 36 cookies and Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we calculate:

"To determine the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we start by calculating the total amount of money Ali has initially. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills.

\[
\text{Total money} = (4 \times 10) + (6 \times 20) = 40 + 120 = 160
\]

Next, Ali gives half of this total money to his sister.

\[
\text{Money given to sister} = \frac{160}{2} = 80
\]

The remaining money after giving half to his sister is:

\[
\text{Remaining money} = 160 - 80 = 80
\]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining money to buy dinner.

\[
\text{Money used for dinner} = \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{240}{5} = 48
\]

The amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is:

\[
\text{Remaining money after dinner} = 80 - 48 = 32
\]

Thus, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is \(\boxed{32}\)."

"To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we start by understanding the painting rate of one person. Given that one person can paint half a house in 5 days, the rate of one person is:

\[
\text{Rate of one person} = \frac{1/2 \text{ house}}{5 \text{ days}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
\]

When 5 people work together, their combined rate is:

\[
\text{Combined rate of 5 people} = 5 \times \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{5}{10} \text{ house per day} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}
\]

This means that 5 people can paint half a house in one day. Therefore, to paint a whole house, it would take:

\[
\text{Time for 5 people to paint a whole house} = \frac{1 \text{ house}}{\frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}} = 2 \text{ days}
\]

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have.

Given:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas.
- Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_O = C_O - 2 \).
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3C_O \).
- Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so \( S_J = C_J - 2 \).

First, we find the number of chairs Ophelia has:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 20 + 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]

Next, we find the number of chairs Jenna has:
\[ C_J = 3C_O \]
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]

Then, we find the number of sofas Jenna has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had not bought the headphone set, we can follow these steps:

     \]

3. **Calculate how many more CDs Tom could have bought without the headphone set:**
   - Without the headphone set, Tom would have $48.
   - The number of CDs he could buy with $48 is:
     \[
     \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ CDs}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
     \[
     12 - 11 = 1 \text{ CD}
     \]

Thus, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy \(\boxed{1}\) more CD."

- 8 passengers get off the bus.
- The number of passengers who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 passengers get off the bus.
- The number of passengers who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) passengers.

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

Therefore, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's proceed step by step:

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine his cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, his cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years.

3. **Determine his cousin's current age:**
   - If his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then his cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.
   - His cousin is currently 47 years old.
   - The age difference is \( 47 - 22 = 25 \) years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To find the cost of one monitor, we start with the given information:
1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The cost of the computer is $1,100.
3. The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the printer costs $700.

We can set up the equation for the total cost:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
Combining like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"To determine the number of seashells each girl brought, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - The number of boys and girls is equal.
   - Therefore, the number of boys and girls is:
     \[
     \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys:**
   - Each boy brought 60 seashells.
   - The total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
     \[
     10 \times 60 = 600
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of seashells brought by the girls:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - The number of seashells brought by the boys is 60.
   - Four times the number of seashells brought by the boys is:
     \[
     4 \times 60 = 240
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by each girl is:
     \[
     60 + 240 = 300
     \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"Given that George has 3 candies left after eating 5, it means George originally had \(3 + 5 = 8\) candies. Since Nick had twice as many candies as George initially, Nick had \(2 \times 8 = 16\) candies. Therefore, the number of candies Nick has is 16.

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."

"To find the total thickness of the four books, we will calculate the thickness of each book individually and then sum them up.

1. The thickness of the first book is 31 mm.
2. The thickness of the second book is 50 mm.
3. The thickness of the third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which is \(50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}\).
4. The thickness of the fourth book is twice the thickness of the first book, which is \(2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}\).

Now, we sum the thicknesses of all four books:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm} = 188 \text{ mm}
\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\)."
"To determine how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we start by calculating the total number of vlogs she has already made. She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. Adding these together gives:

\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Next, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her monthly goal of 72 vlogs:

\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine how much you ended up paying, we need to calculate the total amount including the tip.

1. **Calculate the tip:**
   - The dinner bill is $50.
   - You want to add an additional 20% tip.
   - To find 20% of $50, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount:**
   - The total amount is the sum of the bill and the tip:
     \[
     \text{Total Amount} = 50 + 10 = 60
     \]

Therefore, you ended up paying $60.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{60}\)."

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount of $18 is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his initial share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Spending $8:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8 from his total:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Tripling the Remaining Amount:**
   - After spending $8, he triples the remaining amount:

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we start by setting up the equation based on the given conditions. Elvis's total monthly saving target is $1125. He saves twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. April has 30 days, so the first half consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let \( x \) be the daily savings in the first half of April. Then, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

The total savings in the first half of April would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings in the second half of April would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings would be the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

Given that the total monthly saving target is $1125, we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $25 each day in the first half of April. Consequently, in the second half of April, he needs to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine the change Verna received, we first calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought. 

The cost of the apples is calculated as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = \$4.50 \]

The cost of the oranges is calculated as follows:
\[ 5 \text{ oranges} \times \$0.80 \text{ per orange} = \$4.00 \]

The cost of the peaches is calculated as follows:
\[ 6 \text{ peaches} \times \$0.75 \text{ per peach} = \$4.50 \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits:
\[ \$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00 \]

Verna gave the seller $20. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:

"To determine how much more Jairus will earn compared to Jenny, we start by calculating their individual earnings based on the number of tasks they each completed.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task. Since he completed 20 tasks, his total earnings are:
\[
0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task. Since she also completed 20 tasks, her total earnings are:
\[
0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much more Jairus earned compared to Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:
\[
16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Jairus will earn \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"Let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, he should reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact reduction, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in Juan's coffee intake is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

If we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee \( R \) is a known value, we can substitute it into the expression to find the exact reduction. For example, if \( R = 8 \):
\[ 5R - 4 = 5 \times 8 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

Thus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

The total number of rodents in the pet shop is 45."
"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we start by determining their individual weights. Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so her weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so his weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is:
\[ 180 \text{ pounds} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{180} \]"
"To determine the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we start with the initial angle of the sun from the ground, which is 32 degrees. The sun moves 5 degrees upward from the pyramid per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will have moved \(5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}\) upward from the pyramid.

Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground, and it moves 50 degrees upward from the pyramid, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be the sum of these two angles:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{82}\)."

Since each pack contains 5 candles, the number of packs required is 20 / 5 = 4 packs. Given that each pack costs $3, the total amount James spends is 4 packs * $3/pack = $12.

Thus, the final amount James spends on candles is $12."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total reading time in the first week
Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 days in the first week.
\[
15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the reading time in the first week to pages
We know that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[
\frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute}
\]

Now, we convert the 105 minutes of reading time in the first week to pages:
\[
105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 3: Add the reading time in the second week
In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

### Step 4: Calculate the total reading time in two weeks
\[
140 \text{ pages (first week)} + 100 \text{ pages (second week)} = 240 \text{ pages}
\]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine how many sandwiches are left, we start with the total number of sandwiches, which is 12. 

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so the number of sandwiches Cody ate is:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, so the number of sandwiches Trevor ate is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
\]

The total number of sandwiches eaten by both Cody and Trevor is:
\[
4 + 3 = 7
\]

Subtracting the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial total gives the number of sandwiches left:
\[
12 - 7 = 5

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the current age of Shiloh's nephew as \( x \). Given that Shiloh is currently 44 years old, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 51, and his nephew's age will be \( x + 7 \).

The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the current age of Shiloh's nephew is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we will sum the contributions from each set of teeth lost.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Total for these three teeth: \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth.
   - Amount per tooth for the last two teeth: \(\frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50\) dollars.
   - Total for the last two teeth: \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the amounts:

\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of goals each teenager scored based on the given information.

1. Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can find Anna's goals by subtracting 45 from Richie's goals:
   \[
   \text{Anna's goals} = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]
3. Since Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, we can find Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals:
   \[
   \text{Mark's goals} = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

Now, we sum the goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Richie's goals} + \text{Mark's goals} + \text{Anna's goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is \(\boxed{175}\)."

"To find the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses, we start by calculating the value of Juan's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we first determine 30% of Herb's house value, which is $76,000.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Subtracting this from Herb's house value gives us the value of Juan's house:

\[ \text{Value of Juan's house} = 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house to find the combined value:

\[ \text{Combined value} = 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is \(\boxed{129200}\)."
"To find the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we start by calculating the number of cups and dishes each brought.

Judy initially bought:
- 12 cups
- Twice as many dishes as cups, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes

Her friend brought:
- 40 cups
- 20 more dishes than cups, which is \(40 + 20 = 60\) dishes

Next, we sum the total number of cups and dishes brought by both:

Total cups:
\[ 12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52 \text{ cups} \]

Total dishes:
\[ 24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 60 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 84 \text{ dishes} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of utensils:
\[ 52 \text{ cups} + 84 \text{ dishes} = 136 \text{ utensils} \]

Thus, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{136}\)."
"To determine the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes, we start by calculating the discounted price of one box. The original price of one box is $100.00, and with a 10% discount, the price becomes:

\[ 100.00 - (100.00 \times 0.10) = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

So, each box costs $90.00 after the discount. For 2 boxes, the total cost is:

\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts, so 2 boxes contain:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

Since Pete uses one pair of contacts per day, 180 contacts will last for:

\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we first calculate the total hours each worked.

Jill worked:

"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the total calories burned during her workout. She burns 500 calories per hour for 2 hours of aerobics and 600 calories per hour for 1 hour of running.

1. **Calories burned during aerobics:**
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Calories burned during running:**
   \[
   1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Total calories burned:**
   \[
   1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}
   \]

Next, we calculate the amount of water needed. Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

4. **Water consumption calculation:**
   \[
   \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml}

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left-hand side:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of green jelly beans that are more than the number of red jelly beans is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we first calculate the total cost for each platform.

For Amazon:
- The cost of the boots is $16.
- The shipping cost is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is:
  \[
  16 + 4 = 20
  \]

For eBay:
- The cost of the boots is $13.
- The shipping cost is twice that of Amazon, which is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is:
  \[
  13 + 8 = 21
  \]

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:
\[
21 - 20 = 1
\]

Thus, the boots are \(\boxed{1}\) dollar more expensive on eBay."

"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we start by calculating the total cost of the implants and the additional porcelain crown. The cost for two implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the extra cost for the porcelain crown:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

George has already paid a deposit of $600, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars} \]

Given that George earns $15 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work to earn $3900 is:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours George needs to work is:
\[ \boxed{260} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by letting the smallest angle be \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is \( 2x \) degrees, and the other angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

1. **Dogs:**
   \[
   5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Cats:**
   \[
   2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs per cat} = 8 \text{ legs}
   \]

3. **Birds:**
   \[
   10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs per bird} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

Next, we sum the legs from all the pets:
\[
20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}
\]

Thus, the total number of legs in the pet store is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa together in 12 hours, we start by calculating the hourly production rates and then extend that to 12 hours.

First, Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. Therefore, Ruiz's hourly production rate is:
\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Next, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much as Ruiz in one hour. Thus, Marissa's hourly production rate is:
\[
\text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates made by each in 12 hours:
\[
\text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these totals together gives the combined production:
\[
\text{Total chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is \(\boxed{1260}\)."
"To determine how much money Howard has left after his spending at the arcade, we need to calculate his total spending over the three days and then subtract that from his initial amount of $100.

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   Howard spends $8 on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's spending} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday's spending} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Spending:**
   To find the total amount spent over the three days, we sum the amounts spent each day.
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Money:**
   Howard originally had $100. To find out how much he has left after his spending, we subtract the total spending from his initial amount.
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}

For the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

Earnings for the first 4 hours:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30.00 \]

For the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

Earnings for the next 2 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12.00 \]

Summing the earnings from both segments:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

"To determine how many years Jeremy's tires need to be replaced, we start by calculating the total number of rotations the tires undergo in a month. Given that the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles driven, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we first find the rotations per mile:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations for 400 miles:

\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

Now, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations:

\[ \text{Number of months} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert 72 months into years:

\[ \text{Number of years} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find the cost of each pump in cents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per wash:**
   - The total cost of the shampoo bottle is $24.00.
   - The total number of washes per bottle is 120 washes.
   - Therefore, the cost per wash is:
     \[
     \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
     \]

2. **Convert the cost per wash to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, the cost per wash in cents is:
     \[
     0.20 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 20 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost per pump:**
   - Each pump gives 60 washes.
   - Each wash costs 20 cents.
   - Therefore, the cost per pump is:
     \[
     60 \text{ washes per pump} \times 20 \text{ cents per wash} = 1200 \text{ cents}

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after purchasing the outfit, we first need to calculate the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts.

The original price of the shirt is $25, and with a 30% discount, the discount amount is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
Thus, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The original price of the shorts is $35, and with a 30% discount, the discount amount is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
Thus, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Adding the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts gives the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe starts with $50. After spending $42.00 on the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Joe will have left is:

\[
\text{Total butter needed} = 28 \text{ dozens} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first calculate the cost for each street individually.

For Monica's street:
- Length: 150 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 29100 \, \text{dollars}
\]

For Lewis' street:
- Length: 490 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 94860 \, \text{dollars}
\]

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = 94860 \, \text{dollars} - 29100 \, \text{dollars} = 65760 \, \text{dollars}

Therefore, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street is \(\boxed{65760}\)."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 50 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months of the extended period are already covered by the initial funding.
   - Therefore, the extended period is \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.

3. **Funding for Extended Period:**
   - Each month after the first 5 months costs 50% more than the initial $20,000 per month.
   - The cost per month for the extended period is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars.
   - The total funding for the extended 45 months is \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

4. **Total Funding:**
   - Adding the initial funding and the extended funding gives us the total cost.
   - Total cost = Initial funding + Extended funding
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1450000}\)."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to sum the meat consumption of each player individually.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate beef tips, each an ounce in size, and there were 8 beef tips. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Thus, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed during the first three days. Since the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for three days, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed during the remaining four days. On these days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days, which means it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars towed during the first three days to the number of cars towed during the remaining four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert his current height from inches to feet. Adam's current height is 40 inches, and since there are 12 inches in a foot, we have:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet by \(\frac{1}{6}\) feet per year:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine how much James made from his sales, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 10 cars:
\[ 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

2. Calculate the amount the company paid to acquire these cars:
\[ 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

3. Determine the total profit James made:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

4. Calculate James's commission, which is 10% of the profit:
\[ 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

Therefore, the amount James made is:
\[ \$17,500 \]"
"To determine the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright:**
   - Given that 25% of the 100 riders can stay upright, we calculate:
     \[
     100 \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of these riders who are women:**
   - Since 60% of the 25 riders are women, we calculate:
     \[
     25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of these riders who are men:**
   - The remaining 40% of the 25 riders are men, so:
     \[
     25 \times 0.40 = 10 \text{ men}
     \]

Therefore, the number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 10. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

- The price of a gold jewel \( G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \) dollars.
- The price of a silver jewel \( S = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \) dollars.

The total price for all three jewels is:
\[ D + G + S = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is \( 4800 \) dollars."
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we will calculate the number of each type of stamp and then sum them up.

1. Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
2. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is:
   \[
   16 + 3 = 19
   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stamps:
\[
16 + 19 + 10 = 45
\]

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's define the variables:
- \( v_B = 55 \) miles per hour (speed of Bob)
- \( v_T = 70 \) miles per hour (speed of Tom)
- \( d = 75 \) miles (distance between Bob and Tom)

The relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap is the difference in their speeds:
\[ v_{\text{relative}} = v_T - v_B = 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The time \( t \) it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap can be calculated using the formula:
\[ t = \frac{d}{v_{\text{relative}}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ t = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how many fish Tommy caught, we start by finding out how many fish Darren caught. Given that Naomi caught 17 fish and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, we calculate:

\[
\text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 = 11
\]

Next, we know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Therefore, we calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:

\[
\text{Tommy's fish} = 11 + 3 = 14
\]

Thus, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to ensure that the cost per class does not exceed $10. Given that the total cost for 10 classes is $60, we can calculate the maximum number of classes per class as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

For the cost per class to be at most $10, we set up the inequality:

\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):

\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means that if Manny misses 6 or fewer classes, the cost per class will be at most $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss is:

\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we start by calculating the daily customer counts and then extend that to a weekly total.

1. **Daily Customer Counts:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - Julie processes twice as many as Jewel, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

2. **Weekly Customer Counts:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers in a week.
   - Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers in a week.

3. **Total Weekly Production:**
   - Total customers processed by Jewel in a week: 350
   - Total customers processed by Julie in a week: 700
   - Total customers processed by both in a week: \(350 + 700 = 1050\)

Thus, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is \(\boxed{1050}\)."
"To determine how many miles Lynn ran, we start by noting that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

We are also informed that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Therefore, we can express Lynn's distance in terms of Reggie's distance:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

Substituting the distance Reggie ran:

\[ 20 = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

To find Lynn's distance, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"To determine how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we start by finding the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[
\text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[
\text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10
\]

Now, we find the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00
\]

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

So, the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet.

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for Bob to dig this volume. It is given that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we start with the base price and then add the costs of the additional features:

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: $30,000
2. **King Cab Upgrade**: $7,500
3. **Leather Seats**: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade.
   \[
   \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500
   \]
4. **Running Boards**: $500 less than the leather seats.
   \[
   \text{Cost of running boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
   \]
5. **Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: $1,500

Now, we sum all these costs together:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 = 43,500
\]

Thus, the total cost of Bill's new truck is \(\boxed{43500}\) dollars."
"To determine Tim's annual income after his promotion, we start by calculating his new monthly salary and then add the bonus.

1. **Calculate the new monthly salary:**
   - Original monthly salary: $20,000
   - Raise: 5% of $20,000 = $1,000
   - New monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

2. **Calculate the bonus:**
   - Bonus: Half a month's salary = $21,000 / 2 = $10,500

3. **Calculate the total monthly income:**
   - Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus
   - Total monthly income = $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500

4. **Calculate the annual income:**
   - Annual income = Total monthly income \(\times\) 12
   - Annual income = $31,500 \(\times\) 12 = $378,000

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."
"To find the total cost of everything James bought, we will calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of suits:**
   James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   The cost of each pair of dress pants is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   \[
   \text{Cost of each pair of dress pants} = \frac{750}{5} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   James buys 10 pairs of dress pants.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits.
   \[
   \text{Total number of dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30
   \]
   Each dress shirt costs $60.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800 \text{ dollars}

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we proceed as follows:

First, we calculate the total cost Clara paid for the 20 pomegranates on Tuesday:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]
After applying the $2 voucher discount:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Sheila paid for the 20 pomegranates on Wednesday. The price per pomegranate was $30, and she received a 10% discount on the total cost:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]
Applying the 10% discount:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the total earnings from green hats in the first month. Given that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats, we can set up the equation:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total earnings from green hats in the first month is $800. Adding the earnings from red hats, the total earnings for the first month are:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

For the second month, the sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month:

\[ \text{Total second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Adding the earnings from both months gives the total earnings over the two months:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we start by calculating the total number of deviled egg halves required. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves and she is inviting 16 guests, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Given that 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, the number of whole eggs required is:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the number of dozens of eggs needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen eggs} \]

Therefore, the number of dozens of eggs Lori needs is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \) minutes.
3. The time to cook beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) = \frac{1}{2} (50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \) minutes.

Now, we sum the cooking times for all the food:
\[ R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given information:
- The total number of animal heads is 20.
- The total number of animal legs is 70.
- Sheep have 1 head and 4 legs.
- Geese have 1 head and 2 legs.

We can set up the following system of equations based on the information:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (where \( S \) is the number of sheep and \( G \) is the number of geese)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep \( S \) is 15. To verify, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, let's check the number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchases, we start by calculating the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. Therefore, the cost of the more expensive coffee is:

\[ \$5 + (0.20 \times \$5) = \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \text{ per pound} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week. Since he uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs:

\[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

The total cost of the coffee is then:

\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$42 \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost of everything is:

\[ \$42 + \$2 = \$44 \]

Thus, the total cost is \(\boxed{44}\)."

"To determine the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we start by calculating the number of math teachers. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can find the number of history teachers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90
\]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
\]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[
\text{Total sleeping time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the amount of money each person has. Given that Aurelia has $120, we can calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find out how much Rayna has, knowing that she has 60 more dollars than Kassidy:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we start by noting the total number of good days Christina had over the 30 days, which is 12. We then account for the distribution of these good days over the three periods:

- The first 8 days had 8 good days.
- The second 8 days had 0 good days.
- The third 8 days had 0 good days.

This accounts for \(8 + 0 + 0 = 8\) good days. We are also given the next three days:
- Day 29: 1 good day.
- Day 30: 1 good day.
- Day 31: 1 good day.

Adding these up, we have \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\) good days from the last three days. Therefore, the total number of good days is \(8 + 3 = 11\). Since Christina had 12 good days in total, the number of good days left in the month is \(12 - 11 = 1\).

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we'll break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, meaning he needs 1 toy per dog.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs 8 more toys to have one toy per dog. Therefore, he needs 8 toys initially.
3. After buying the toys, the number of dogs in the shelter becomes 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 dogs.
4. Since he needs 1 toy per dog, he now needs 12 toys.
5. When James comes back again, 3 dogs have gone, so the number of dogs left is 12 - 3 = 9 dogs.
6. Therefore, he now needs 9 toys.

Summarizing the total number of toys needed:
- Initially, he needed 8 toys.
- After buying the toys, he needed 12 toys.
- When he came back again, he needed 9 toys.

Adding these together: \(8 + 12 + 9 = 29\).

"To determine the total time Chris took to mow the lawn, we need to consider the time he spent in each mode and then sum these times.

First, we convert the time taken in ""turtle"" mode to minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode takes 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.

Next, we convert the time taken in ""rabbit"" mode to minutes:
- ""Rabbit"" mode takes 40 minutes.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode, we calculate the time for each half:
- Time taken for the first half (in ""turtle"" mode) = 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.
- Time taken for the second half (in ""rabbit"" mode) = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we sum the times for both halves to find the total time taken:

"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44.

Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

From the first piece of information, we have:
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]

From the second piece of information, we have:
\[ T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

"To determine how much John leaves with, we first calculate the total cost of the services. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20, and a heartworm check that is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill by \( T \).

The cost of the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, so:
\[ \text{Heartworm check cost} = 0.6T \]

The total bill \( T \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - Each crate contains 5 bananas.
   - The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple.
   - Given that one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each crate contains 12 apples.
   - The price of one apple is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Each crate contains 7 oranges.
   - The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana.
   - Given that one banana costs $1.0, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - Summing the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges:
   \[
   5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0
   \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32.0}\)."
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to calculate the number of each color of square on the comforter and then sum these to find the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Given: 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - Given: 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Calculation: \(14 + 4 = 18\) blue squares.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - Given: 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Calculation: \(18 + 6 = 24\) green squares.

4. **White Squares:**

"To determine the number of additional chairs needed, we start by calculating the total number of chairs required for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, making a total of:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \text{ people} \]

Given that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs} \]

Adding the high chairs to the regular chairs gives us the total number of chairs currently available:

\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of people:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \text{ chairs} \]

Therefore, the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine the number of 8-point bucks, we start by calculating the number of bucks. Given that 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we have:

\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50\% \times 50 = 0.50 \times 50 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8-point bucks is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total points collected by the class, we start by calculating the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam** has collected 50 points.
2. **Betty** collected 30% more points than Adam. Therefore, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Marta** collected 3 times more points than Tom. Since Tom has 30 points, Marta's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]
4. **Tom** has 30 points.

Now, summing up the points collected by all students:
\[
50 + 65 + 90 + 30 = 235
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:
\[
400 - 235 = 165
\]

Thus, the class is missing \(\boxed{165}\) points to go on the trip."
"To determine the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion, we can follow the lineage step by step systematically.

1. **Great Grandma Jones has three children.**
   - Number of children = 3

2. **Each of her children has three children of their own (grandchildren).**
   - Number of grandchildren per child = 3
   - Total number of grandchildren = Number of children * Number of grandchildren per child
   - Total number of grandchildren = 3 * 3 = 9

3. **Each of these grandchildren has three children of their own (great grand-babies).**
   - Number of great grand-babies per grandchild = 3
   - Total number of great grand-babies = Number of grandchildren * Number of great grand-babies per grandchild
   - Total number of great grand-babies = 9 * 3 = 27

Therefore, the total number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is 27.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Greta's total paycheck is $2400.00. She allocates 50% of her paycheck to her retirement account, which amounts to:

\[ 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

After funding her retirement account, the remaining amount is:

\[ 2400 - 1200 = 1200 \]

Next, she uses 20% of her original paycheck for her monthly car payment, which is:

\[ 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

Subtracting the car payment from the remaining amount after retirement contributions gives:

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we start by determining the capacity of Gordy's truck. Given that Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. Let \( G \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total capacity as:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2800} \]"
"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of dumplings each female ate:**
   Each female ate 3 dumplings.

"To determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to reach their goal of $6300, we start by noting that they have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. This means they need to raise an additional $4200 to meet their goal.

Given that they raise an equal amount each hour, the amount raised per hour is:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

To find out how many more hours are needed to raise the remaining $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Adding the initial 3 hours to the additional hours gives the total number of hours required:
\[ \text{Total hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal is:

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
   - 80% of this 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Calculate 80% of 40%:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 = 32\%
     \]

2. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total percentage of water used by Colorado City is 40%.
   - Subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes (32%) from the total percentage used by Colorado City:
     \[
     40\% - 32\% = 8\%

"To determine the number of slices of pizza left, we start by calculating the total number of slices ordered. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Then, we calculate the slices eaten by the two remaining friends. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends, we get the total number of slices eaten:

\[ 24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we start by noting the time taken by the cat, which is 30 minutes. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes, so the dog's time is:

\[
\text{Time for the dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

The average time is the sum of the times taken by the cat and the dog, divided by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is \(\boxed{25}\) minutes."
"To solve the problem, we start with the information that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We are given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed by the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( 9x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we start by calculating the total number of windows in the students' cars and the teachers' cars.

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"To determine the percentage of blue spools of thread, we start by calculating the total number of spools:

Total number of spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green)
Total number of spools = 150

Next, we calculate the total number of blue spools:
Total number of blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue)
Total number of blue spools = 60

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100
\]
\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
\]
\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage of blue spools of thread is 40%. The correct answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To solve the problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the number of people who voted by midday:**
   - Total number of people initially: 5000
   - Fraction of people who voted by midday: \( \frac{2}{5} \)
   - Number of people who voted by midday: \( 5000 \times \frac{2}{5} = 2000 \)

2. **Determine the number of people remaining after midday:**
   - Number of people remaining after midday: \( 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \)

3. **Calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00:**
   - Fraction of remaining people who voted by 16:00: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00: \( 3000 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2000 \)

4. **Determine the number of people who did not vote by 16:00:**
   - Number of people who did not vote by 16:00: \( 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \)

The number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \( 1000 \)."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we start by calculating the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in that period. Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so over 30 days, he will chew:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required to get 120 pieces. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, the number of packs needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we start by calculating the total number of smores required. There are 9 kids, each wanting 2 smores, and 6 adults, each wanting 1 smore. Therefore, the total number of smores is:

\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} + 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 18 + 6 = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we need to find out how many graham cracker bases are required. Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 smores. Thus, the number of sleeves needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

Therefore, the number of boxes of graham crackers needed is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we start by calculating each individual's age based on the given information.

First, we determine Dora's father's age. The problem states that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we calculate:

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we find Dora's mother's age. The problem indicates that Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we sum the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother to find the total combined age:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is \(\boxed{87}\)."
"To determine how much money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people sharing it. Greg and his 3 siblings make a total of 4 people.

The total amount of money is $20. So, we divide $20 by 4:

\[
\frac{20}{4} = 5

"To find the total weight of all the books Cindy is carrying, we sum the weights of each book individually:

- Math and science books: \(2 \text{ pounds each, 2 books} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}\)
- French book: \(4 \text{ pounds}\)
- English book: \(3 \text{ pounds}\)
- History book: \(2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds}\)

Adding these weights together:

\[
4 \text{ (math and science)} + 4 \text{ (French)} + 3 \text{ (English)} + 6 \text{ (history)} = 17 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is \(\boxed{17}\) pounds."
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we start by calculating the votes for candidate A, who got 20% of the total votes. Given there are 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the votes for candidate B, who received 50% more votes than candidate A:

\[ \text{Additional votes for candidate B} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

So, the total votes for candidate B are:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

The total number of votes is 100. Therefore, the votes for candidate C are the remaining votes after accounting for candidate A and candidate B:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - 50 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Boris initially has 100 apples, and Beck has 23 fewer, which means Beck has \(100 - 23 = 77\) apples. When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris's apples become \(100 - 10 = 90\) and Beck's apples become \(77 + 10 = 87\). The difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck now is \(90 - 87 = 3\).

Therefore, the number of fewer apples Beck has than Boris now is 3. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

Next, let's calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

Then, let's calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we sum the water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used: \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
- Initial amount of water: 32 ounces.
- Water left: \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine how many more books Clara has than Alice, we start by finding out how many books Steven has. Given that Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can calculate Steven's books as follows:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{\text{Clara's books}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Finally, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we start by calculating the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can find the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

1. **Cost of 10-gallon jars:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 10-gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of 16 half-gallon jars:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the total number of students and the number of students with specific hobbies. The class has 50 students in total. Out of these, 10 students like to bake and 5 students like to play basketball. The rest of the students, who are 35 in number, like to either play video games or play music.

Given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball, we can denote the number of students who like to play music as \(M\) and the number of students who like to play video games as \(V\). Since the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, we have:
\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

The total number of students who like to play video games or play music is 35. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ V + M = 35 \]
Substituting the value of \(M\):
\[ V + 10 = 35 \]
Solving for \(V\):
\[ V = 35 - 10 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of students who like to play video games is \(25\).

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Jeremy initially saw 12 birds. When he threw a stone, he scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 12 birds, which is 4 birds. Therefore, the number of birds remaining after the stone was thrown is \( 12 - 4 = 8 \) birds. A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. So, the total number of birds now in the backyard is \( 8 + 20 = 28 \) birds.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of students in each class:**
   - The total number of students in the two classes is 80.
   - Since each class has the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
     \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   - In each class, 40% of the students are girls.
   - To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
     \]

3. **Determine the number of boys in each class:**
   - Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the remaining students must be boys.
   - We subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
     \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of cake slices that remained on the plate.

1. Initially, there were 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. Mara added 3 more slices to the plate.
   \[

"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we start by summing up the total number of animals she has to groom this week. She has:

- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

Adding these together gives:
\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Melissa has 28 animals to groom over the course of the week. Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days, we need to divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

So, we perform the division:
\[ \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the profit Mark made, we first calculate the total cost of the packs he bought. He bought 3 packs at $1800 each, so the total cost is:

\[
3 \times 1800 = 5400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total value of the cards he received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. The total value of these cards is:

\[
4000 + 1000 + 30 \times 50 = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \text{ dollars}
\]

The profit is the total value of the cards minus the total cost of the packs:

\[
6500 - 5400 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the profit Mark made is:

\[
\boxed{1100}

"To determine the savings, we first calculate the total cost for each amusement park.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adults is \(2 \times 26 = 52\).
- The cost for each child is $12, and there are 2 children, so the total cost for children is \(2 \times 12 = 24\).
- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\).

For the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $14, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adults is \(2 \times 14 = 28\).
- The cost for each child is $10, and there are 2 children, so the total cost for children is \(2 \times 10 = 20\).
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\).

The savings by choosing the second amusement park over the first is the difference between the two total costs:
\[ 76 - 48 = 28 \]

Thus, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park."
"To determine the weekly savings, we first calculate the daily savings by comparing the cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor to the new vendor.

1. **Daily cost from the old vendor:**
   - Cost per tomato from the old vendor: $0.5
   - Number of tomatoes bought per day: 500
   - Daily cost from the old vendor: \( 500 \times 0.5 = \$250 \)

2. **Daily cost from the new vendor:**
   - Cost per tomato from the new vendor: $0.4
   - Number of tomatoes bought per day: 500
   - Daily cost from the new vendor: \( 500 \times 0.4 = \$200 \)

3. **Daily savings:**
   - Daily savings = Daily cost from the old vendor - Daily cost from the new vendor
   - Daily savings = \( 250 - 200 = \$50 \)

4. **Weekly savings:**
   - There are 7 days in a week
   - Weekly savings = Daily savings \(\times\) 7 days
   - Weekly savings = \( 50 \times 7 = \$350 \)

Therefore, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"To find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have, we start by determining the number of marbles each has based on the information provided.

First, we know Sean has 56 marbles. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we calculate Carl's marbles as follows:
\[ \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we know Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Therefore, we can find the number of marbles Cal has by doubling the number of marbles Sean has:
\[ \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Now, to find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have, we add their individual amounts:
\[ \text{Combined number of marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ 336 \]"
"To determine how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups from 54 students, we first need to understand the feasibility of forming 12 groups of equal size.

Given:
- Total number of students = 54
- Desired number of groups = 12

We calculate the number of students per group if we form 12 groups:
\[
\text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group}
\]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to form 12 groups of equal size with 54 students. Therefore, we need to form 6 groups instead.

Next, we calculate the number of students per group if we form 6 groups:
\[
\text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group}
\]

Since 9 is a whole number, it is possible to form 6 groups of 9 students each.

To find out how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups, we subtract the number of groups we can form (6) from the desired number of groups (12):
\[
\text{Number of additional groups needed} = 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ groups}
\]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is 6.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months, we first calculate the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month.

In one 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- Therefore, in 4 weeks, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

The number of chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month is:
\[60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 20 \text{ days} = 1200 \text{ chairs}\]

The number of chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month is:
\[100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ chairs}\]

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
\[1200 \text{ chairs} + 800 \text{ chairs} = 2000 \text{ chairs}\]

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
\[2000 \text{ chairs} \times 2 = 4000 \text{ chairs}\]

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[
\boxed{4000}

"To determine how many bananas Gunther found in the pile, we will follow the sequence of events step by step:

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther initially had 48 bananas.

2. **Arnold steals half:**
   Arnold stole half of the bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]

3. **Gunther adds 25 bananas:**
   Gunther added 25 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas after Gunther adds 25} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]

4. **Arnold steals another 12 bananas:**
   Arnold stole 12 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 49 - 12 = 37
   \]

5. **Gunther adds 6 more bananas:**
   Gunther added 6 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas after Gunther adds 6} = 37 + 6 = 43
   \]

Thus, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is:
\[
\boxed{43}
\]"
"To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we start with the total monthly cost of $100 and divide it by the number of roommates, which is 4. This gives us the monthly cost per roommate:

\[
\text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
\]

Next, to find the annual cost per roommate, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year, which is 12:

\[
\text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300
\]

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we start by calculating the initial quantities sent:

- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses, which is \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.
- Jeff sent 4 dozen plates, which is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

Next, we account for the items that were returned broken:
- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

We subtract the broken items from the total items sent to find the remaining quantities:
- Remaining glasses: \(96 - 10 = 86\)
- Remaining plates: \(48 - 6 = 42\)

Adding the remaining glasses and plates together gives us the total number of items Jeff has now:
- Total remaining items: \(86 + 42 = 128\)

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{128}
\]"
"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end, we will follow the steps systematically:

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 \)

Thus, by the end, Lorraine has 107 buttons. The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{107}\)."
"To determine the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we sum the matches played each day as follows:

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Adding these together:
\[ 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). Consequently, the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \). The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). Given that the total number of people on the council is 33, we can set up the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{22}

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we will calculate the number of students for each size and then sum them up.

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - Number of students needing XS shirts = 11

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of students needing S shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of students needing M shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of students needing L shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of students needing XL shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size of shirt to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
\text{Total shirts} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75
\]

Therefore, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is \(\boxed{75}\)."

"To determine the total number of puppies Jana has, we start with the information that two thirds of her puppies are Pomeranians. Let's denote the total number of puppies by \( P \). Therefore, the number of Pomeranian puppies is \( \frac{2}{3}P \).

We are also informed that one third of these Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. This gives us the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = 6 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve for \( P \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

Thus, the total number of puppies Jana has is \( 27 \)."
"Jayden initially had $70 from selling pictures. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. Adding this to his initial amount, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200, so the amount Jayden still needs is $200 - $115 = $85. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

Given:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so it needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so it needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed.

1. **Determine the number of books Ahmed read:**
   - We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour.
   - Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed read:
     \[
     \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of books Ezra read:**
   - Ezra initially read 300 books.
   - He decided to read 150 more books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books Ezra read is:

Thus, the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed altogether is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"To determine Tanya's total earnings for teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we'll break down the calculations for each day separately.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each day.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ \text{Base earnings} = 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Since she teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3 classes, she qualifies for the additional $5 per day:
\[ \text{Total earnings for Monday} = \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each day.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not qualify for the additional $5 per day since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ \text{Base earnings} = 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not qualify for the additional $5 per day, her total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \$60 \]

**Total earnings for both days:**
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total earnings for Monday} + \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \$305 + \$60 = \$365 \]

Thus, Tanya earned a total of \(\boxed{365}\) dollars for these two days of teaching."

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the return trip is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back home is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions, we'll break down the costs step by step.

First, we calculate the number of series movies:
\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]

Next, we find the number of non-series movies:
\[ \text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Then, we determine the number of older movies among the non-series movies:
\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

This leaves us with the number of non-older non-series movies:
\[ \text{Number of non-older non-series movies} = 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we calculate the costs:
- The cost for the series movies is $6 each:
\[ \text{Cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]
- The cost for the non-older non-series movies is $10 each:
\[ \text{Cost for non-older non-series movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]
- The cost for the older movies is $5 each:
\[ \text{Cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400 \]

Therefore, the total cost to replace the movies is:
\[ \boxed{4400} \]"

Therefore, Winston spent a total of \(\boxed{38}\) dollars on fruit."
"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance driven:
- The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- Distance driven = Speed × Time = 50 miles/hour × 6 hours = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked:
- The Llesis family hiked for 1.5 hours.
- The average speed when hiking is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half of the driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
- Therefore, the hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
- Distance hiked = Speed × Time = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
- Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

The final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we start by calculating the points each player earns based on the given conditions.

Ava's points:
- From enemies: \(10 \times 8 = 80\)
- From berries: \(5 \times 3 = 15\)
- From time left: \(30 \times (-4) = -120\)

Total score for Ava:
\[ 80 + 15 - 120 = -25 \]

Emma's points:
- From enemies: \(10 \times (E_E - (E_E + 8)) = 10 \times (-8) = -80\)
- From berries: \(5 \times (B_E - (B_E + 3)) = 5 \times (-3) = -15\)
- From time left: \(30 \times (T_E - (T_E + 4)) = 30 \times (-4) = -120\)

Total score for Emma:
\[ -80 - 15 - 120 = -215 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the total cost of four pizzas is 64 dollars. Two of these pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so the combined cost of these two pizzas is:

\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

This means the combined cost of the remaining two pizzas is:

\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the two remaining pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes thrice a day.
- They do this for 5 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) rides per day.
- They do this for 2 days.

So, the number of times they ride their bikes on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given conditions. Let \( o \) represent the number of orange fish Bob bought, and \( w \) represent the number of white fish he bought. We know the following:

1. The total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:
\[ o + w = 17 \]

2. After adding the new fish to his pond, the number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + o \) and the number of white fish becomes \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Next, substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2w + 5 + w = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now, substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

We can verify the solution:
- The total number of fish bought is \( o + w = 13 + 4 = 17 \).
- After adding the fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- The number of orange fish is indeed twice the number of white fish: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we first calculate the total distance he drives in a week. Since he drives 5 miles one way and he makes a round trip each day from Monday to Friday, the total distance driven in a week is:

\[ 5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ (round trip)} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons of gas consumed per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

At a price of $3 per gallon, the cost of gas per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:

\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also has 140 quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the amount spent on the quarters, which is the total value of the quarters:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the amounts spent on quarters and twenties gives the total amount spent for lunch:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:

\[
\boxed{142}

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we start with the total sales of 40 TVs. We know that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. Let's calculate these first.

The number of smart TVs sold is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

The number of analog TVs sold is:
\[
\frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

The number of OLED TVs sold is the total sales minus the number of smart TVs and analog TVs:
\[
40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of groups formed and then calculate the number of seashells brought back.

1. **Determine the number of groups:**
   - The total number of people is 90.
   - Each group consists of 9 people.
   - The number of groups is calculated by dividing the total number of people by the number of people per group:
     \[
     \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
     \]

2. **Determine the number of groups that brought back seashells:**
   - According to the problem, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups brought back seashells.
   - Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells:
     \[
     \text{Number of groups bringing back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought back:**
   - Each group that brought back seashells had 2 seashells.
   - The total number of seashells is calculated by multiplying the number of groups bringing back seashells by the number of seashells per group:
     \[
     \text{Total number of seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12
     \]

Thus, the total number of seashells brought back is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine how much money Mike will have left after purchasing the jeans, we start by calculating the discounted price. The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are advertised at a 25% discount. The discount amount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \]

Subtracting the discount from the original price gives us the sale price:

\[ \text{Sale price} = 40.00 - 10.00 = 30.00 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he will have left, we subtract the sale price from the amount he paid:

\[ \text{Money left} = 50.00 - 30.00 = 20.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20.00} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of employees after three months:**
   - The company hires 20 new employees every month.
   - After three months, the number of new employees hired is \(20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees}\).
   - The initial number of employees is 200.
   - Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is \(200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees}\).

2. **Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month:**
   - Each employee is paid $4000 per month.
   - The total salary paid to all employees each month is \(260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month}\).

3. **Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months):**
   - The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is \(1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars}\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total time Carrie and the choir will be caroling, we need to sum the durations of the songs ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells.""

First, we calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice.
- Each performance of ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.

\[
\text{Total time for ""Deck the Halls""} = 2 \times 150 \text{ seconds} = 300 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time for ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once.
- Each performance of ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

\[
\text{Total time for ""Jingle Bells""} = 1 \times 240 \text{ seconds} = 240 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we add the total times for both songs to find the total caroling time:

\[
\text{Total caroling time} = 300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the total time they will be caroling is:

\[

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then their earnings for 20 hours.

First, let's find Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
1. **Initial hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, the raise:** $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, the raise:** $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Next, we calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours at each stage:
1. **Initial earnings (first 2 months):**
   \[
   10 \text{ hours/month} \times 2 \text{ months} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. **Earnings after the raise (first anniversary):**
   \[
   11.50 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 230 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up Billy's total earnings:
\[
400 \text{ dollars} + 230 \text{ dollars} = 630 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate Sally's hourly wage:
1. **Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's initial salary:**
   \[
   10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

We calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours:
\[
10.50 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 210 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
\[
630 \text{ dollars} - 210 \text{ dollars} = 420 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Billy will earn $420 more than Sally in 20 hours. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\text{Half of Pierson's score} = \frac{278}{2} = 139
\]

Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's score:

\[
\text{Nikita's score} = 139 + 11 = 150
\]

Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:

\[
\text{Total points} = 278 + 150 = 428
\]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To determine the total number of trees planted, we start by calculating the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes, with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ \text{Total number of teachers} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of trees planted by the students and teachers.

Each student plants 1 tree:
\[ \text{Total trees planted by students} = 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees:
\[ \text{Total trees planted by teachers} = 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, we add the trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted:

"To determine how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach the 30-hour goal, we start by calculating the total hours she has already played. 

First, we calculate the hours played in the first 2 weeks:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the hours played in the last week:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these together gives the total hours played so far:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach 30 hours, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total required:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."

"James buys a ring for his bride-to-be. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. He pays a 30% premium for it to be made. To find out how much he paid in total, we first calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium:

\[ \text{Total cost before premium} = \$600 + \$300 = \$900 \]

Next, we calculate the premium, which is 30% of the total cost before the premium:

\[ \text{Premium} = 0.30 \times \$900 = \$270 \]

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost before the premium to find the final amount James paid:

\[ \text{Total cost after premium} = \$900 + \$270 = \$1170 \]

Therefore, the total amount James paid is \(\boxed{1170}\)."
"To find the overall pass rate for Janet's collection of results from Herbert Hoover Elementary School's annual standardized test, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's determine the pass rates for each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Pass rate} = \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \text{ or } 68\%
   \]

2. **Fourth-grade pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Pass rate} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \text{ or } 40\%
   \]

3. **Fifth-grade pass rate:**
   The fifth-grade pass rate is twice the fourth-grade pass rate:
   \[
   \text{Fifth-grade pass rate} = 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \text{ or } 80\%
   \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass students:**
   \[
   \text{Number of third-grade pass students} = 340
   \]

2. **Fourth-grade pass students:**
   \[
   \text{Number of fourth-grade pass students} = 40
   \]

3. **Fifth-grade pass students:**
   \[
   \text{Number of fifth-grade pass students} = 0.80 \times 400 = 320
   \]

Now, we sum the number of students who passed in all grades:

\[
\text{Total number of pass students} = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700
\]

The total number of students tested is:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000
\]

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we start by calculating the total number of glass chips he has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Given that it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we have:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. 

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students drank. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many more butterscotch candies Dale needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Order and Sales:**
   - Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
   - He sold 150 butterscotch candies.

2. **Remaining Candies After Sales:**
   - Since he sold 150 candies but only had 100 ordered, he would have run out of candies and needed to order more.
   - Therefore, he sold all 100 candies he initially had and needed to order 100 more to meet the demand.

3. **Additional Order:**
   - Dale ordered 100 more candies to replenish his stock.

4. **Total Candies Now:**
   - After ordering 100 more candies, Dale now has:
     \[
     100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (additional order)} = 200 \text{ candies}
     \]

5. **Total Candies Sold:**
   - Dale has already sold 150 candies.

6. **Candies Still Needed to Sell:**
   - To find out how many more candies Dale needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he now has:
     \[
     200 \text{ (total candies now)} - 150 \text{ (candies sold)} = 50 \text{ candies}
     \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 more candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we start with the total amount of money he made during the week, which is $105. Given that he charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs, we can calculate the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total money made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420
\]

Since this total was made over the course of a week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[
\text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60
\]

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine the total number of petals in the vase after Rose picks and loses some flowers, we will calculate the petals step by step.

First, we calculate the petals from each group of flowers she picks:
- For the 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- For the 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- For the 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- For the 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Next, we sum these values to find the total number of petals initially:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

Rose then drops 1 flower from each group, which means she loses:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\] petals.

Subtracting the lost petals from the initial total gives:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals.

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:

"John and DeSean bought a bag of 35 marshmallows. They each made 9 S'mores, using a total of \(9 + 9 = 18\) marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is \(18 + 3 = 21\). This leaves \(35 - 21 = 14\) marshmallows in the bag.

With 14 marshmallows remaining, and since each S'more requires one marshmallow, each of them can have \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) S'mores.

Therefore, the number of S'mores each can have with the remaining marshmallows is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played and then convert that into the number of quarters required.

First, let's summarize the time each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack: 20 minutes
- Each of the two worse friends: 10 minutes
- The better friend: 30 minutes

Next, we calculate the total time played:
- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- Each of the two worse friends plays for 10 minutes, so together they play for \(10 + 10 = 20\) minutes.
- The better friend plays for 30 minutes.

Adding these times together, the total time played is \(20 + 20 + 30 = 70\) minutes.

Since each quarter allows them to play for 20 minutes, the number of quarters needed is calculated by dividing the total time played by the time each quarter allows:
\[
\frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 12 quarters. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses, we start by defining the quantities of each ingredient in terms of a single variable. Let's denote the amount of salt used as \( S \). Given the relationships:

1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

We can substitute \( C \) with \( S \) and \( F \) with \( S \). Therefore, we have:
- \( O = 2S \)
- \( F = S \)
- \( C = S \)
- \( G = S \)

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation, we get:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil used, which is \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}

"To determine how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
4500

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 3 \times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The cost per pound is $0.35.
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - Therefore, the cost for the weight of the book is \(4 \times 0.35 = 1.40\) dollars.
   - The cost per mile is $0.08.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - Therefore, the cost for the distance is \(20 \times 0.08 = 1.60\) dollars.
   - The total shipping cost is \(1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the refundable portion of the book's purchase price:**
   - The book cost $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - Therefore, the refundable amount is \(32 \times 0.75 = 24.00\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The total cost to Milly is the shipping cost plus the cost of the book.
   - The cost of the book is $32.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(32 + 3.00 = 35.00\) dollars.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance across the highway, given that three kangaroos take 18 hours to do so.

1. **Determine the total distance \( D \) traveled by the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of each kangaroo be \( v \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of each turtle:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - Let \( t \) be the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed in terms of the speed of the turtles and the time \( t \):
     \[
     D = 4 \left( \frac{v}{2} \right) t = 2vt
     \]
   - Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
     \[
     54v = 2vt
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27

"To find the total number of socks and dishes that Peter and Jack have together, we start by determining the number of socks and dishes each has based on the given information.

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Since Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, we can calculate the number of socks Jack has as follows:
   \[
   S = \frac{D}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]
   So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ socks}
   \]
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has:
   \[
   \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ dishes}
   \]
5. Now, we calculate the total number of items each has:
   - Jack has \( 30 \text{ socks} + 60 \text{ dishes} = 90 \text{ items} \)
   - Peter has \( 60 \text{ socks} + 30 \text{ dishes} = 90 \text{ items} \)
6. Adding the total number of items together:
   \[
   90 + 90 = 180
   \]

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"To determine the number of students good at math, we start with the total number of students, which is 20. We know that 5 students are good at math only and 8 students perform well in English only. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students who are good at both math and English:
\[ \text{Number of students good at both} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Next, we find the total number of students good at math by adding those who are good at math only to those who are good at both math and English:
\[ \text{Total number of students good at math} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the intermission. Each group takes:

- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes per group} \]

The total concert time is 2 hours, which is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtracting the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time:
\[ 120 - 10 = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we divide the remaining time by the time required for one group:
\[ \frac{110}{10} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we start with the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% = 2.25\) (as a decimal)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

Let's compute this:
\[ 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]
\[ 675 \times 3 = 2025 \]

So, the simple interest earned over 3 years is $2025.

Next, we add the simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"To solve the problem, we first determine the number of white shirts with collars and without collars. Given that half of the 40 white shirts have collars, we have:

- White shirts with collars: \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \)
- White shirts without collars: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)

Next, we know that 20 of the 50 floral shirts have buttons. Therefore, the number of floral shirts without buttons is:

- Floral shirts without buttons: \( 50 - 20 = 30 \)

We need to find how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars. This is calculated as:

- Difference: \( 30 - 20 = 10 \)

Thus, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 10 more than the number of white shirts without collars. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the earnings, we start by calculating the number of trays needed. Given that each tray holds 30 eggs and the farmer has 900 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the capacity of each tray:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray. Each tray is sold for $2.5, so:

\[
30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of goats left in both farms after the sales, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of goats sold from each farm:**
   - From Farm X, 10 goats were sold.
   - From Farm Y, twice as many goats were sold as from Farm X, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

2. **Subtract the number of goats sold from the initial number of goats in each farm:**
   - The number of goats left in Farm X is \(55 - 10 = 45\).
   - The number of goats left in Farm Y is \(45 - 20 = 25\).

3. **Sum the remaining goats from both farms:**
   - The total number of goats left is \(45 + 25 = 70\).

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes, we start by calculating the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year. Given that he buys 2 pairs of shoes each month and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of pairs he buys in a year is:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that he spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average amount he spends on each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:

\[ 110 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, with a $2 discount per basket of red food.

1. **Cost of 3 baskets of green food:**
   Each basket of green food costs $25.
   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 baskets of green food} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:**
   Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket.
   \[
   \text{Discount per basket of red food} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per basket of red food after discount} = 18 - 2 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 baskets of red food} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost:**
   Add the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we will calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. **First Year:**
   The town builds 12 homes.
   \[
   \text{Homes built in the first year} = 12
   \]

2. **Second Year:**
   The town builds three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Homes built in the second year} = 3 \times 12 = 36
   \]

3. **Third Year:**
   The town counts the total number of homes built in the first two years and then doubles this total.
   \[
   \text{Total homes built in the first two years} = 12 + 36 = 48
   \]
   \[
   \text{Homes built in the third year} = 2 \times 48 = 96
   \]

4. **Total Homes Built Over Three Years:**
   Sum the homes built in each of the three years.
   \[

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the given relationships:

- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mom.
- Let \( Y \) be the age of the younger person (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express the age of the sister \( S \) in terms of \( Y \) and \( B \):
\[ S = Y - 2 \]

Next, we substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now we have:
\[ Y = B - 3 \]
\[ S = B - 5 \]

We substitute these into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now we can find \( Y \):
\[ Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required. With 27 students and each student needing 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to meet this need. We divide 54 by 8:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to have enough glue sticks, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   - On the first day, the amount of water is 4000 gallons.

2. **Amount of Water on the Second Day:**
   - After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles.
   - Therefore, on the second day, the amount of water is \( 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \) gallons.

3. **Amount of Water on the Third Day:**
   - On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons.
   - Therefore, on the third day, the amount of water is \( 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \) gallons.

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:
14000"
"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we start with the initial 10 infected people. Each day, each infected person infects 6 others. Let's calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total number of infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total number of infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total number of infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"To determine the total amount of tips received by Rafaela and Julieta, we start by calculating Rafaela's total tips. Given that each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate her total tips as follows:

\[
\text{Rafaela's total tips} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much money Julieta received as tips. The problem states that Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[
10\% \text{ of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total tips gives us Julieta's total tips:

\[
\text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the total amount of tips they received together:

\[
\text{Total tips} = \text{Rafaela's total tips} + \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of tips received by Rafaela and Julieta altogether is:

\[

"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges. Her only son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is \(6 + 3 = 9\).

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:

\[12 - 9 = 3\]

Thus, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges. The correct answer is 3."
"To determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we start by calculating the number of badges each person earns.

1. **Claire's Badges:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges in a year.

2. **Amber's Badges:**
   - It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Since Claire earns a badge every month, Amber earns a badge every 2 months.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges in a year.

3. **Wendy's Badges:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges in a year.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber is \(36 - 6 = 30\).

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

"To determine how much Paige raised, we follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked:
   Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours.

2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked:
   Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Over 5 hours, the total number of loaves baked is:
   \[
   2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. Calculate the total number of banana bread slices:
   Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
   \[
   10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. Find out the total revenue from selling the slices:
   Each slice is sold for 50 cents. The total revenue from selling 80 slices is:
   \[
   80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Paige raised is:

"Given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can determine the number of silver coins by solving the equation:

\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives:

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we start by calculating the total number of burritos distributed to the students. There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we subtract the 20 burritos that Mr. George ate from the 500 burritos distributed to the students:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 480 \text{ burritos} \]

Finally, we subtract the 480 burritos distributed to the students and the 20 burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total of 600 burritos ordered:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 480 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 120 \text{ burritos} \]

Thus, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine the number of yellow cars, we start by calculating the number of each type of car:

1. **Red Cars:** The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars:** The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is \(12 - 2 = 10\).
3. **Blue Cars:** The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so the number of blue cars is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars:
\[
12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52
\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
75 - 52 = 23
\]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books and Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books. The total number of books is 85, so we can write the equation:

\[
(A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
3A + 37 = 85
\]

Subtract 37 from both sides to isolate the term with \( A \):

\[
3A = 48
\]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( A \):

\[
A = 16
\]

Now, since Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books, we substitute \( A = 16 \) into the expression:

\[
A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28
\]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{28}

"To determine the weight of the carrots Daisy bought, we start by noting the weight of the potatoes, which is 5 pounds. The weight of the sweet potatoes is 2 times the weight of the potatoes, so we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight of the carrots is 3 pounds less than the weight of the sweet potatoes, so we subtract 3 pounds from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we first calculate the total number of jello cups needed. Given that there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Since one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Given that each box costs $1.25, the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Greg will spend on jello is:

"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we start by calculating Madeline's and Keenan's monthly contributions. Given that they spend a total of $400 per month and Madeline pays 60% of this amount, we first find Madeline's monthly payment:

\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting Madeline's payment from the total monthly cost gives Keenan's monthly payment:

\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4 to find his weekly payment:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Keenan spends per week is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten so far, we will follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60 pieces.

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the second day} = 10 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Remaining pieces after the second day**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Pieces eaten on the third day**:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces}

"To determine the cost for David's purchase, we first calculate the cost per bottle for both soda and water.

For soda:
- Seven bottles cost $21.00, so the cost per bottle is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

For water:
- Four bottles cost $8.00, so the cost per bottle is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost for David's specific purchase:
- He wants 3 bottles of soda, which will cost 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
- He also wants 2 bottles of water, which will cost 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Adding these amounts together, the total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $13.00."
"To determine how much money David has left after buying 16 bolts, we first calculate the total cost of the bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so the total cost for 16 bolts is:

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \(60 - 8 = 52\). According to the problem, this was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, four years ago, Adam's age was \(\frac{52}{2} = 26\). Therefore, Adam's current age is \(26 + 4 = 30\).

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[30 + 8 = 38\]

Thus, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The correct answer is \(\boxed{38}\)."
"To find the total number of acres for both Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms, we start by calculating the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Given that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:

\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms combined, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:

\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"Colby completes 40 packages per hour. Over an eight-hour workday, he completes:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

"To determine the number of yellow balloons, we start with the given information:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.
- The number of red balloons is 20.

We can set up the equation based on the total pieces of bologna:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Given that \( R = 20 \), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon needs, we start by calculating the total distance he drives in a month. Given that he drives 100 miles per day for 30 days, the total distance is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

- On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
- On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Adding these together, the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days is:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we first calculate the total cost of the items they bought:

1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[ \text{Amount each received} = \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Kira bought a total of 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges, which sums up to 14 pieces of fruit. After Lola ate 2 pieces, the number of pieces left is 14 - 2 = 12 pieces.

"To find the total number of students participating in the sports, we start by calculating the number of students playing each sport:

1. **Tennis**: There are 6 students playing tennis.
2. **Volleyball**: Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis, the number of students playing volleyball is:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ students}
   \]

Next, we sum the number of students playing tennis and volleyball:
\[
6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} = 18 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we consider the students playing soccer:
- There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is:
\[
16 + 22 = 38 \text{ students}
\]

Since each student only participates in one group, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer to find the total number of students:
\[
18 \text{ (tennis and volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the total number of students is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To determine the profit the class made from selling lollipops, we start by calculating the total number of lollipops sold. Given that each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Larry has 3 cats, 9 dogs, 7 rabbits, 21 fish, and 7 gerbils. Adding these together gives the total number of pets:

"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we first calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat together in one day. Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much, which is 4 slices per day. Therefore, together they eat:

\[ 2 \text{ slices (Abby)} + 4 \text{ slices (Josh)} = 6 \text{ slices per day} \]

Given that the loaf of bread has 24 slices, the number of days the loaf will last is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices per day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

Thus, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days. The correct answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row. Let's break it down step by step.

Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea. She uses 15 cups to brew cinnamon tea, leaving her with:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
These 12 cups are equally divided between chamomile and mint tea, so she brews:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
cups of each (chamomile and mint).

Since she divides these 27 cups into 3 rows, each row contains:
\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]
cups of tea. Given that the cups in each row are equally divided between chamomile and mint tea, each row contains:
\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]
cups of mint tea.

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we start by analyzing the time and resources involved in each trip. The sloth takes 4 hours to complete one round trip (down to the ground and back up to the tree). Given that the sloth has 8 hours to collect berries, we can calculate the number of trips it can make in this time:

\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and it can make 2 trips in that time, the number of berries picked up per trip is:

\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we start by calculating the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool contains 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water is removed from the tank over 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we start by calculating the total amount spent on popcorn and candy. Colby spent $8 per tub of popcorn and had 2 tubs, and $2 per box of candy and had 4 boxes. Therefore, the total spent is:

\[ 2 \times 8 + 4 \times 2 = 16 + 8 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting this from his monthly budget of $150, we find the remaining budget:

\[ 150 - 24 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Since it is the last day of the month and it is a Friday, Colby can only see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday, which costs $10. Therefore, the number of additional movies he can see is:

\[ 1 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"To find the total calories from the mini pastries, we start by calculating the calories for each type of mini pastry.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, which is \(\frac{600}{3} = 200\) calories.
- With 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories are \(200 \times 200 = 40000\) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, which is \(\frac{450}{3} = 150\) calories.
- With 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories are \(300 \times 150 = 45000\) calories.

Adding the total calories from both types of mini pastries:
\[ 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

Thus, the total calories from the pastries Andrew baked is \(\boxed{85000}\)."
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days. 

- On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Adding these together:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 299
\]

The total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299. To find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days, which is 5:
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"To determine how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

The difference in distance traveled is:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of bouncy balls Sophie bought, we start by calculating the total number of toys she had before purchasing the bouncy balls. This includes the building blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:

\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \text{ toys} \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls were in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:

\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

First, substitute \( Pa = J + 10 \) into the equation for Peter's age:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now substitute \( P = 2J + 10 \) and \( Pa = J + 10 \) into the combined age equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To determine the total number of water balloons, we start by calculating the initial distribution:

- Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so the friends collectively received \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons.
- Maria herself received 1 water balloon.

Adding these initial balloons together:
\[ 8 \text{ (friends' balloons)} + 1 \text{ (Maria's balloon)} = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Next, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons:
- There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so the total number of additional balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) balloons.

Adding the initial total to the additional balloons:
\[ 9 \text{ (initial balloons)} + 15 \text{ (additional balloons)} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

Thus, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"To determine the number of new tables needed, we start by calculating the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale. 

1. Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes of stuff:
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already:
   \[
   10 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. Adding these together gives the total number of boxes:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff.

4. Calculate the number of tables needed:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

They already own 15 tables.

5. Calculate the number of new tables needed:
   \[
   30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ new tables}
   \]

Therefore, the number of new tables needed is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total widget production and revenue for each machine over a month.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be the cost of the 24-hour option minus the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option.
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we start by calculating the hay requirement for each type of livestock.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, each sheep needs:
\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay needed for the goats and the sheep gives the total amount of hay Nate needs:

   \text{Total earnings from carrots} = 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding these amounts together gives us the total earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Jen will earn **$34** if she sells everything."
"To determine the total time James took to swim across the lake, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half the initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"To determine the number of loaves of bread the bakery has, we start with the information that the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had last Friday. Given that Sam had 70 loaves, we can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ \text{Bakery loaves} = 7 \times (\text{Sam's loaves}) - 40 \]

Substituting Sam's loaves (70) into the equation:

\[ \text{Bakery loaves} = 7 \times 70 - 40 \]

First, we calculate \( 7 \times 70 \):

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we subtract 40 from 490:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 450 \]"
"Jasmine initially had 15 stickers. After losing 7, she had:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Therefore, the final number of stickers Jasmine has is 13. 

**Multiple-choice options:**
A) 8
B) 10
C) 12
D) 13

The correct answer is D) 13."
"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to compute the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each New York Times.
- Commission per New York Times = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.
- Total commission from New York Times = 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each Wall Street Journal.
- Commission per Wall Street Journal = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal = 10 * $1.20 = $12.

Finally, we sum up the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal = $3 + $12 = $15.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"Given the information:

1. Marcus is half of Leo’s age.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.
3. Deanna is 26 years old.

From the information, we know Deanna's age is 26. Since Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, Marcus is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years old. Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, Leo’s age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:
42"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points are \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points are \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 3A + 30 - 30 = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information: the book is 1.5 inches thick, and each inch of paper contains 100 pages when stacked. Since each page is printed on both sides, the thickness of the book corresponds to the number of pages in 1.5 inches of paper.

First, we calculate the number of pages in 1 inch of paper:
\[
1 \text{ inch} = 100 \text{ pages}
\]

Next, we extend this to 1.5 inches:
\[
1.5 \text{ inches} = 1.5 \times 100 \text{ pages} = 150 \text{ pages}
\]

Since each page is printed on both sides, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we start by calculating the total time he spent stapling reports. Vince worked from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, which totals 16 hours. Converting this time into minutes, we get:

\[ 16 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 960 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 960 minutes:

\[ 960 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 64 \text{ intervals} \]

Given that Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he stapled is:

\[ 64 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1920 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1920."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to account for her total sleep time, the time she spent sleepwalking, and the time she woke up early.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Calculate the time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Calculate the time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual at 5:55 a.m.
   - The usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at \( 6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.} \).

4. **Calculate the total time she was awake:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is \( 7 \text{ hours and } 55 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Converting this to minutes: \( 7 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 420 \text{ minutes} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 475 \text{ minutes} \).

5. **Calculate the total time spent sleepwalking and waking up early:**
   - Total time awake: 475 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Time waking up early: 5 minutes
   - Total time not sleeping: \( 23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes} \).

6. **Calculate the actual sleep time:**
   - Total sleep time: 480 minutes
   - Time not sleeping: 28 minutes
   - Actual sleep time: \( 480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{452}\)."
"Jonathan initially has 24 measuring cups. Given that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

After giving 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we start by calculating the initial number of occupied beds. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied:

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

This means the initial number of unoccupied beds is:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day and there are 14 days in 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

Adding these to the initial number of occupied beds gives the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900
\]

Finally, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"Robyn sends sixteen emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails, leaving 9 emails that are not work emails. Two-thirds of these 9 emails are sent to her family, which amounts to \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) emails. This leaves \( 9 - 6 = 3 \) emails, and one-third of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \) email. Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we start by finding Shawna's age. Given that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate Shawna's father's age, knowing that he is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we start with the information that Courtney reported 48 people, and this number is 20% more than the actual number. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

Given that 48 is 120% of the actual number, we can write the equation:
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Performing the division:
\[ x = 40 \]

Thus, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Given the information, we have the following relationships:
- Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.
- Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason.
- Jason carried 2 balls.

Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). Then Jason carried \( 2J \) balls, and Jordan carried \( 4J \) balls. Since Jason carried 2 balls, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 2 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we can follow these steps:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: The pirates dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: The pirates dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, resulting in a net increase of \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

By the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

4. **Fourth Day**: The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes by the end of the third day should be:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find the total number of corn chips, we start by noting that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips. Therefore, the total number of corn chips received by Amora and Lainey together is:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]

Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey, so Collins received:
\[ 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Adding the number of corn chips received by Amora, Lainey, and Collins gives us the total number of corn chips:
\[ 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 \]

Thus, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To determine the cost of the travel tickets, we start with the cost of the supplies, which is $400. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. Therefore, we calculate 50% of $400:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Adding this to the cost of the supplies gives us the total cost of the travel tickets:

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Thus, the total cost of the travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon caught by Stan.
- Let \( X \) be the number of Pokemon caught by Alex.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the third equation:

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now, find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[
S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, find \( X \):

\[
X = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Check the total:

\[
X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}

"Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can determine the number of episodes first. Let \( E \) be the number of episodes and \( M \) be the number of minutes per episode. We know \( M = 20 \) minutes, and the number of episodes \( E \) is half of the number of minutes per episode, so:

\[ E = \frac{M}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are 10 episodes. To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode:

\[ \text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes."
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in each segment of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ \boxed{446} \]"
"To determine the number of brownies Greta had left over, we start by calculating the total number of brownies she received:

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office, she received half a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Summing these up gives the total number of brownies:
\[
12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies}
\]

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Converting this to individual brownies:
\[
1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
\]

Subtracting the eaten brownies from the total gives the number of brownies left:
\[
66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies}
\]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we start by calculating each individual's age. Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so:

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:

\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Adding these ages together gives the total age of the three family members:

\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."

   - Total time for synthetic gut: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) minutes

2. **Polyester String Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time for polyester string: \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time for hybrid sets: \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \) minutes

Now, we sum the times for all the racquets:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of states in the USA as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of states in India is \( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \left( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{2S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3S}{2} + 4 \]

Without a specific value for \( S \), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume the USA has 50 states, then:
\[ S = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{150}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 75 + 4 \]

- Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.

First, we calculate the number of cherries Richard has:
\[ \text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the number of cherries Jerry has by subtracting the number of cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:
\[ \text{Jerry's cherries} = 60 - (\text{Robert's cherries} + \text{Richard's cherries}) = 60 - (30 + 20) = 60 - 50 = 10 \]

Finally, we find the difference in the number of cherries between Robert and Jerry:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Robert's cherries} - \text{Jerry's cherries} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Thus, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine Sunny's total earnings over the two days, we'll calculate the number of boxes sold and then the total revenue from each type of baked good.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

**Total boxes sold:**
- Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Apple pie: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

**Earnings calculation:**
- Price per box of gingerbread: $6
- Total earnings from gingerbread: 25 * $6 = $150
- Price per box of apple pie: $15
- Total earnings from apple pie: 21 * $15 = $315

- Total earnings = $150 (gingerbread) + $315 (apple pie) = $465

Therefore, Sunny earned a total of **$465** over the two days."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside over 8 days.
2. Determine the total amount of sunscreen she will need.
3. Calculate how many 8-ounce bottles are required to cover the total amount of sunscreen needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside.**

Pamela spends 4 hours outside each day for 8 days:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of sunscreen she will need.**

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour. Therefore, for 32 hours:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many 8-ounce bottles are required.**

Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen. To find out how many bottles are needed for 32 ounces:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"The price of the blue car is $100. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, which means the red car is priced at 60% of the price of the blue car. Therefore, the price of the red car is:

\[ 0.60 \times 100 = 60 \]

So, the price of the red car is $60. The total cost of both cars is:

\[ 100 + 60 = 160 \]

Thus, the total cost of both cars is $160. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Given the information, we start by noting that Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, which is 5 years from now, he will be half the age of his dad and twice the age of his brother.

First, we calculate the age of Emil's dad in 5 years:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we calculate the age of Emil's brother in 5 years:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ B = 7 \]
So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

Now, we find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ 43 + 7 = 50 \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To determine the total number of beads Adrianne has, we start by calculating the beads given by each person:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
2. Adrianne's sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
3. Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total number of beads:

\[
20 \text{ (from mother)} + 30 \text{ (from sister)} + 40 \text{ (from friend)} = 90
\]

Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we first calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days. On Thursday, he caught 3 pounds. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of crawfish:
\[3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

Since each serving is 3 pounds, the total number of servings is:
\[\frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}\]

Therefore, the number of servings Joe has is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. This means there are:

\[ 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ football players} \]

The remaining students are:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. Therefore, the number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band is:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

Adding the football players and the cheerleaders/band members, the total number of students leaving early is:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we start by noting that Sophie's boots are size 5. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, Charlie's boots are size 25.

The average size of the shoes is calculated by adding the sizes of their boots and then dividing by 2:
\[ \text{Average size} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers required to fill her flower bed. Each flower is 1 foot wide, and there is a 1.5-foot space between each pair of flowers. Let \( n \) be the total number of flowers needed. The equation representing the total space occupied by the flowers and the spaces between them is:

\[ n + 1.5(n-1) = 111 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n = 112.5 \]
\[ n = \frac{112.5}{2.5} \]
\[ n = 45 \]

Pat needs 45 flowers in total. Since she already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy:

\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ flowers} \]

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost is:

\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store is:

"To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we start by calculating the daily consumption of Edgar's brother. Given that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many, we can calculate the daily consumption of Edgar's brother as follows:

\[ \text{Daily consumption of Edgar's brother} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7:

\[ \text{Weekly consumption of Edgar's brother} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

Therefore, the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week is:

\[ 63 \]"
"To determine the total cost Katherine will incur for filling all 5 hanging baskets, we start by calculating the cost for one basket. Each basket requires 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.

The cost for the petunias in one basket is:
\[ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00 \]

The cost for the sweet potato vines in one basket is:
\[ 2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost for one basket:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost for all 5 baskets is:
\[ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"To determine how many roses can be planted, we first calculate the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations. Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers, so the soil used for sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations, so the soil used for carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for sunflowers and carnations gives:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

Subtracting the soil used for sunflowers and carnations from the total soil in the bag leaves:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose requires 1 pound of soil, the number of roses that can be planted with the remaining 3 pounds of soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck to buy fancy shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we first calculate her monthly savings:

\[
\text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500
\]

Next, we calculate her total savings for a year:

\[
\text{Annual savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000
\]

Given that each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, the number of pairs of shoes she can buy in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6

Therefore, the number of pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine the total time Emily needs to peel and saute 90 shrimp, we'll break down the tasks separately and then sum the times.

First, we calculate the time required to peel 90 shrimp. Given that Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, the time to peel 90 shrimp is:

\[
\text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time required to saute 90 shrimp. The problem states that Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Therefore, to saute 90 shrimp, we need:

\[
\text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Adding the time for peeling and sauteing together gives us the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}

"To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: 6 degrees.
- Cooling on high: 12 degrees.
- Warming up: 4 degrees.

Net change in temperature:
\[ 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the room warms up by 14 degrees, it is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature. Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it. This means Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time. Since the comet's orbital period is 75 years, the first sighting was 75 years before the second sighting. Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to sum up the checks for each category:

"To determine the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day, we start by defining the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- The number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
- The number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \).
- The number of flights to Germany is \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

We are also given that the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl:

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - Combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls: \( 20 + 40 = 60 \) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Duration:**
   - Sum the durations of all three wolves.
   - Combined duration: \( 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \) seconds.

5. **Convert Combined Duration to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - \( 120 \) seconds ÷ \( 60 \) seconds/minute = \( 2 \) minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   \[
   7 + H + W = 20
   \]

6. **Solve for \( H + W \):**
   \[
   H + W = 20 - 7
   \]
   \[
   H + W = 13
   \]

7. **Use the Information about Helene's Age:**
   Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. First, calculate the average age of the group:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]

   Since Helene is twice the average age:
   \[
   H = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

8. **Substitute Helene's Age into the Equation \( H + W = 13 \):**
   \[
   10 + W = 13
   \]

9. **Solve for \( W \):**

"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we first calculate the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we add the $200 given by Walter's friend to the total collected so far:

- Total collected so far: $2000
- Amount given by Walter's friend: $200

Total amount donated by everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

- Amount donated by everyone else: $2200

6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month is the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is \(40 \times 12 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Given the problem, we need to determine the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha.

First, we calculate the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:
\[
4p = 64 \implies p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Next, we calculate the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha:
\[
7m = 56 \implies m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

To find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number for Peter:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8

Therefore, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To determine the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we start with the initial population of 50 porcupines. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Adding the babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines after a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

### Step 2: Convert Volume to Gallons

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Gallons} = V \times 5.9 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Cost

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) can be calculated as:

\[ C = \text{Gallons} \times 0.10 \]

Let's perform the calculations step by step.

#### Step 1: Calculate the Volume

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]
\[ V = 25 \times 56 \]
\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

#### Step 2: Convert Volume to Gallons

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Cost

\[ C = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ C = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we start by identifying the number of each color of stick:

1. There are 9 red sticks.
2. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks, so we calculate:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14 \text{ blue sticks}
   \]
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, so we calculate:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11 \text{ yellow sticks}
   \]

Next, we sum the number of sticks of each color to find the total number of sticks:
\[
9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34 \text{ sticks}
\]

Therefore, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:
\[ \text{Distance} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy:
\[ \text{Distance} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

The difference in the distances traveled is:
\[ 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove \(\boxed{230}\) miles farther than Matteo."

"To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we start with the equation derived from the problem statement:

\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

First, we calculate \( 0.91^5 \) and \( 0.93^3 \):

\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.656 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]

Then, we multiply these values together:

\[ 0.656 \times 0.817 \approx 0.534 \]

So, the equation simplifies to:

\[ C \times 0.534 = 0.28 \]

Solving for \( C \):

\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.534} \approx 0.524 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 52.4\% \).

"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first calculate her weekly earnings. Janet earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Given that she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we calculate the amount she needs to save, which is 20% of $10,000:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of these fruits:
Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend. After purchasing the fruits, the remaining money is:
Remaining money = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. Therefore, the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Thus, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we start by calculating the total number of pieces of sweets in the box. Given that there are 15 packs and each pack contains 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs given to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs are to be distributed equally among her 10 friends. Therefore, each friend receives:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we use the formula for compound interest:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 + r)^t \]

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% expressed as a decimal)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substituting the values:

\[ P(3) = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculating \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P(3) = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P(3) \approx 139 \]

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To determine the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, we start with the total number of pictures and the distribution into albums.

Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums. We know that 3 albums are for selfies only and 2 albums are for portraits only. This leaves us with 3 albums that are for other categories.

Given that the 3 albums for other categories are evenly split between selfies and portraits, we can assume each of these 3 albums contains an equal number of pictures. Since the total number of pictures is 72 and there are 8 albums, each album contains:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Now, we distribute the pictures into the albums:
- **Selfies**: 3 albums
- **Portraits**: 2 albums
- **Other categories**: 3 albums

Since each album contains 9 pictures, the number of selfies is:
\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

And the number of portraits is:
\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading 18 pages, we start by finding the time it takes to read one page. Given that James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, the time per page is:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we calculate the total time to read 18 pages by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and the given information. Let \( S \) be the price of a small stuffed animal, and \( L \) be the price of a large stuffed animal. We know that \( S = 4 \) dollars and \( L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \). The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (x \times L) + (2x \times S) \]
\[ 120 = (x \times 12) + (2x \times 4) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \).

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we start by noting that the prices are proportional. This means the ratio of the number of sandwiches to the price is constant across all packages.

First, we calculate the price per sandwich for the first two packages:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 100% or 1.00 (since he would have to turn it in if he doesn't get an extension)

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario: 60% (since 60% of the time he doesn't get an extension and thus has to turn it in)

The total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:

\[ 0.50 + 0.60 = 1.10 \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 1, we need to normalize this to a percentage:

\[ \frac{1.10}{2} = 0.55 \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ 0.55 \times 100 = 55\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine how many tickets each graduate will receive, we start by calculating the total number of seats that are already accounted for. This includes 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, which sums up to 1250 seats.

"To determine how many small beans Grandpa can eat, we start by understanding the relationships between the sizes of the jelly beans.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate her total parking expenses:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the expenses from her earnings gives her net earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find her net earnings per hour, we divide her net earnings by the total hours spent:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Thus, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles needed:**
   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet.
   - The number of bottles is calculated by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Determine the time to set off each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle, he will go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The time to go from one bottle to the next is 5 seconds.
   - Since there are 7 intervals, the total time is:
     \[
     7 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 35 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{35}\) seconds."

"To determine how much money Amor will have left after purchasing the cheese, we first calculate the total cost of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese she buys.

The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound is:
\[ 2 \times 11 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of the cheese:
\[ 22 + 18 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. Subtracting the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:
\[ 50 - 40 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the income he lost while in college, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed during college:**
   \[
   50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Determine Jim's post-college income:**
   \[
   25,000 \times 3 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had worked the entire time:**
   \[
   75,000 \times 8 = 600,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount Jim needs to earn to repay the loans and make up for the lost income:**
   \[
   600,000 - 200,000 = 400,000
   \]

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn $400,000 at his post-college income of $75,000 per year:**
   \[
   \frac{400,000}{75,000} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33
   \]

Since Jim cannot work a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number, which means it would take him 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income he lost while in school.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs, we start by calculating the dimensions of each piece of fabric. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Thus, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

The area of one piece of fabric is calculated as:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ \text{Total Area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we will calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   The number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters on Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17
   \]
   First, calculate one-fifth of 425:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
   \]
   Then add 17:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday:**
   The number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters on Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5
   \]
   First, calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then add 5:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

4. **Total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209
   \]
   Add these numbers together:
   \[
   425 + 102 = 527

"To find the average amount lost per race, we first need to determine the total amount lost over the three races. 

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. 
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - Therefore, the amount lost in the second race: $11.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race: $11
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost over the three races:
- Amount lost in the first race: $5
- Amount lost in the second race: $11
- Amount lost in the third race: $16.5
- Total amount lost: \(5 + 11 + 16.5 = 32.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average amount lost per race: \(\frac{32.5}{3} = 10.8333\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Each city has a population of 1000 people. Therefore, the total population in South America is:

\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the total population in South America is:

\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights, we first convert Xavier's initial height to inches. Since 4 feet is equal to 48 inches, Xavier's initial height is 48 inches. After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height is 50 inches, and after growing 2 inches, his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

The difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights is:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is \(\boxed{1}\) inch."
"Let's solve the problem step by step. We are given that three people divided an amount of $1920. The second person took $80 more than the first person, and the third person took twice what the second person took. We need to find the share of the first person.

Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we start by calculating the total number of days the painters worked. Given that the painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day for 3 weeks, and knowing that 3 weeks is equivalent to 21 days, we can calculate the total number of days worked as follows:

\[ 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours worked by all painters. Since each painter works \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day, the total number of hours worked by all 4 painters is:

\[ 7.875 \times 4 = 31.5 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find the number of hours each painter worked, we divide the total hours by the number of painters:

\[ \frac{31.5}{4} = 7.875 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, each painter put in 7.875 hours of work. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 7.875 \]"
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

Given:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We set up the equation:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To combine the terms involving \( x \), we convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[
2x = \frac{4x}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. The correct answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we start with the initial price of $20,000 in 2007 and apply the depreciation rate of 21% per year for three years (from 2007 to 2010).

The formula for the price after depreciation is:
\[
\text{Price} = \text{Initial Price} \times (1 - \text{Depreciation Rate})^{\text{Number of Years}}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
\text{Price in 2010} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3 = 20000 \times (0.79)^3
\]

Calculating \( (0.79)^3 \):
\[
(0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039
\]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:
\[
\text{Price in 2010} = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78
\]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $9860.78.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train. Twice that number, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) people, board the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110

"Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"

"To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we start by calculating the number of emails that require a response each day. Given that 20% of the 80 emails do not require a response, 80% of the emails do require a response.

\[
\text{Number of emails requiring a response per day} = 80 \times (1 - 0.20) = 80 \times 0.80 = 64
\]

Next, we find the total number of emails requiring a response in a 5-day work week by multiplying the number of emails requiring a response per day by 5:

\[
\text{Number of emails requiring a response in a 5-day work week} = 64 \times 5 = 320
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{320}
\]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we sum the number of classes for each day:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, which is \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, which is \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we add these numbers together:
\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247
\]

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is \(\boxed{247}\)."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first sum the scores of all the tests. The scores from the first three tests are 100, 100, and 100, and the score from the fourth test is 80. Adding these together gives:

\[ 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

Next, we divide the total sum of the scores by the number of tests to find the average. Since there are 4 tests, we have:

\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{95} \]"
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we start by calculating the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]
So, the glee club has 6 pizzas left.

Next, we calculate the number of pizzas ordered by the football team, which is twice the number ordered by the glee club:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:

\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]
So, the football team has 8 pizzas left.

Adding the pizzas left from both groups:

\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total number of pizzas left is 14. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we start by calculating the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. Given that he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he plans to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, and he is sending 700 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, and he is sending 1400 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"To determine the number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we start by calculating the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

After Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, the number of remaining sub sandwiches is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Then, Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches, making the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney has now:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of trucks that had mechanical failures. Given that a quarter of the 20 trucks had mechanical failures:

\[
\text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
\text{Number of successful trucks} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 successful trucks is:

\[
\text{Total tons of fertiliser delivered} = 15 \times 20 = 300
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the promotion, we need to consider the following:

1. Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
2. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off,"" meaning for every 2 pounds purchased, Dennis pays for only 1 pound.

First, calculate the number of sets of 2 pounds Dennis needs to buy:
\[
\text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
\]

For each set of 2 pounds, Dennis pays for 1 pound:
\[
\text{Cost per set} = 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$4.00
\]

Since Dennis needs 3 sets:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ sets} \times \$4.00 \text{ per set} = \$12.00
\]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To determine the total cost for Kayla's birthday party, we start by calculating the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: \(25 + 7 + 13 = 45\)

Next, we account for the 4 people who could not attend:

- Guests who could not come: 4
- Guests who will attend: \(45 - 4 = 41\)

The base rental fee for the theater is $125 for up to 20 guests. For the additional guests beyond the initial 20, there is an additional fee of $6 per guest:

- Number of guests beyond the initial 20: \(41 - 20 = 21\)
- Additional fee for these guests: \(21 \times 6 = 126\)

Adding the base fee and the additional fee gives us the total cost:

- Total cost: \(125 + 126 = 251\)

Thus, the total cost for Kayla's birthday party is \(\boxed{251}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Maggie and Riza have left.

Initially, both Maggie and Riza had $60.

Maggie spent a quarter of her money:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza spent one-third of her money:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Adding the amounts of money left for both Maggie and Riza:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[ \boxed{85} \]"
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we start by calculating the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a week. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week (7 days), it eats:

\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:

\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]

In a week, the second monkey eats:

\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Adding the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week gives:

\[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas in total, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:

\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:

\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of the first 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 250 pieces. He also finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour, placing an additional 500 pieces.

The final numerical answer is 750."
"To determine the final numerical answer, let's break down the problem step by step.

Jenny buys 15 roses, and each rose costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the roses is:
\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny arrives with five $5 bills, which totals:
\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

The difference between the total cost and the amount Jenny has is the change she needs:
\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since the florist only provides change in quarters, we need to convert the $5 into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the number of quarters Jenny will receive is:
\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we will calculate the revenue from each item separately and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the revenue from the milkshakes:
\[ 6 \text{ milkshakes} \times \$5.50 \text{ per milkshake} = 6 \times 5.50 = \$33.00 \]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the burger platters:
\[ 9 \text{ burger platters} \times \$11 \text{ per burger platter} = 9 \times 11 = \$99.00 \]

Then, we calculate the revenue from the sodas:
\[ 20 \text{ sodas} \times \$1.50 \text{ per soda} = 20 \times 1.50 = \$30.00 \]

Finally, we sum the revenues from all items to find the total amount of money Terry makes:
\[ \$33.00 + \$99.00 + \$30.00 = \$162.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, let's break down the schedule step by step:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves in 10 minutes, so it arrives in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.
   - The second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed in the station.
   - The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves in 60 minutes (30 + 30).
   - The third train arrives in 60 + 60 = 120 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves in 120 minutes.
   - The fourth train arrives in 120 + 20 = 140 minutes.

Paul needs to board the fourth train, which arrives at 140 minutes after the first train arrives. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, Paul will wait for the fourth train for 140 - 10 = 130 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we start by calculating the number of toothpicks she still needs. Melanie has already saved 120 toothpicks and needs a total of 200 toothpicks. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 - 120 = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"Let's solve the problem step by step. We are given that Sam and Harry together have 100 feet of fence, and Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. Consequently, Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total amount of fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount of fence left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we start with the information that after the Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of it, the remaining meat was then scavenged by velociraptors, leaving half of what was left. Finally, a group of Allosaurus ate the remaining 270 kilograms.

Let's denote the initial amount of meat as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of the remaining meat, leaving \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]

Multiplying both sides by 4 gives:

\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1080}

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to analyze the sequence of events and calculate the probabilities step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 sodas.
   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - This leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken.

2. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.

3. **Ellen's Friend's Turn:**
   - Ellen's friend now has to choose 1 soda from the remaining 4 sodas (2 shaken and 2 unshaken).

We need to calculate the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The total number of sodas left is 4.
   - The number of shaken sodas left is 2.
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

5. **Expressing the Probability as a Percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100.

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. **Speed of the first train:**
   - The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.

2. **Speed of the second train:**
   - The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train.
   - Therefore, the speed of the second train is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

3. **Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - For the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:**
   - For the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Total distance = Distance traveled by the first train + Distance traveled by the second train
   - Total distance = \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is 270 miles."
"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:**
   - March has 31 days.

"To determine the number of people inside the church, we need to calculate the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars, and then sum these two quantities.

First, we calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.

\[
\text{Number of people in buses} = 12 \times 35 = 420
\]

Next, we calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.

\[
\text{Number of people in cars} = 20 \times 3 = 60
\]

Now, we sum the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:

\[
\text{Total number of people inside the church} = 420 + 60 = 480

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we first calculate the time it takes for each slide.

For the biggest slide:
- Length: 300 feet
- Speed: 60 feet/minute

The time to ride the biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

For the second biggest slide:

"To determine the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks over 5 days, we start by calculating the daily total:

- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 breaks of 15 minutes each day. Therefore, the total time per day is:
  \[
  30 \text{ minutes (lunch)} + 2 \times 15 \text{ minutes (breaks)} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Next, we calculate the total time over 5 days:
\[
60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[
300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many miles Ahito ran, we start by calculating the distance Micah ran. Given that Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, we have:

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To determine the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we start with her initial charge of $85.00. After returning an item that cost $15.00, the new balance is calculated as follows:

\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, Sheila buys a frying pan that is 20% off $20.00. The discount on the frying pan is:

\[ 20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]
\[ 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]

Then, she buys a set of towels that is 10% off $30.00. The discount on the towels is:

\[ 30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00 \]
\[ 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]

Adding the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the new balance:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \) jellyfish change color.
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

The correct answer is \( \boxed{90} \)."
"To determine Caroline's age, we start by analyzing the relationships given in the problem:

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we start by calculating her annual savings. Given that she saves 20% of her annual salary of $100,000, her annual savings are:

\[
\text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary in retirement, which is:

\[
\text{Annual living expenses in retirement} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
\]

Since she plans to save for 20 years, the total amount she needs to save for retirement is:

\[
\text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
\]

To find out how many years she needs to work to save \$800,000, we divide the total retirement savings needed by her annual savings:

\[
\text{Number of years needed} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
\]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

"To determine the total number of students in the school, we start with the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. Let \( N \) represent the total number of students in the school. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To solve for \( N \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} = \frac{240 \times 100}{40} = \frac{24000}{40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, to find the number of girls, we note that 60% of the students are girls (since 100% - 40% = 60%). Therefore, the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is \(\boxed{360}\)."

"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we start by calculating the total number of days in June, which is 30 days. She plans to hike a total of 9,300 miles in June.

Next, we calculate the number of miles she plans to hike per day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. This gives us:
\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

To complete her journey in 30 days, she needs to hike:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

The difference between the required miles per day and the planned miles per day is:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Therefore, Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final numerical answer is:

\text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Paul wants one-third of the total 12 kg of apples:

\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Adding the amounts Pierre and Paul want gives:

\[
\text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Subtracting this total from the initial 12 kg of apples leaves:

\[
\text{Apples left for James} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}

"To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we start by calculating the time each person spent on their respective tasks:

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Mowing the lawn took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Walking the dog took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \(4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Doing laundry took her more than 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time is more than \(4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}\).
   - Let's assume Dior took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption given the problem's phrasing).

Now, we sum up the total time taken by all three:

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours} = 22 \text{ hours}

"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in a 10-hour shift.

First, we calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, we calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, we find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 12 toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 8 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. Therefore, the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we start with the given information that Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

First, we calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog, which is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog, which is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weights of both of Elijah's dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight of both dogs} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"To determine how many stickers Seth originally had, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. If Seth originally had \( S \) stickers, then Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total. Therefore, \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

Thus, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}

"John packs M&M in small bags to eat. He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each. If an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it, and he puts 10 M&M in each small bag, the total number of small bags he can make is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we start by calculating half of the Earth's circumference. The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that distance is:

\[
\frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:

\[
\frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth is 50 days. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we start with the given information:

1. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Liam's age two years ago:**
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.
   - Two years ago, Liam's age was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years old.

2. **Set up the relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages:**
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince.
   - Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago.

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   - Two years ago, Liam's age was 14, and this was twice Vince's age.
   - Therefore, \( 14 = 2V \).

4. **Solve for Vince's age two years ago:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]
   - So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago.

5. **Determine Vince's current age:**
   - Since two years have passed since then, Vince's current age is:
     \[
     7 + 2 = 9
     \]

Thus, Vince is currently 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables for the number of eggs painted by each person. Let \( A \) represent the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline, and \( S \) represent the number of eggs painted by Sarah. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

We are given two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, with Camden painting 12 more than Sarah.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ 2A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

From the second piece of information, we have:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplify this equation:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we start by calculating the number of groups of 8 crayons that can be made from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons goes into one box, so we have 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces equal 1 pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"John cuts down an 80-foot tree. He can make logs out of 80% of it, which is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

From these 64 feet, he cuts into 4-foot logs:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Each log is then cut into 5 planks:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Each plank is sold for $1.2, so the total revenue is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount John makes is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To find the total amount of money that Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we start by determining the brother's salary. Given that Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given Valerie's salary is $5000, we solve for the brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times \text{Combined salary} \]

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we start by analyzing the time spent on each segment of her walk.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which is 2 miles long. This means her speed on the beach is:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Given that the sidewalk segment is 1 mile long, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on both segments, the total time for the 3-mile walk is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Jane has saved $32 of her allowance over the past 8 weeks. To reach her goal of $60, she needs to save an additional $28. Since she saves $4 each week, it will take her \( \frac{28}{4} = 7 \) more weeks to save the remaining amount. Therefore, the number of additional weeks required is 7.

"To find the total number of blue birds in the trees, we sum the contributions from each tree:

- From the 3 trees with 7 blue birds each: \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- From the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- From the 1 tree with 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Adding these together gives the total number of blue birds:

\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To determine the initial number of marbles Bob has, we start with the information that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. If Bob loses 10 of these marbles, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we start with the condition that the average temperature of the water in the water bottle must be at least 40 degrees. Initially, we have 4 ounces of water at 33 degrees and 1 ounce of water at \( T \) degrees. After pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug, the average temperature of the water in the water bottle is given by:

\[
\frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the inequality:

\[
\frac{28 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
28 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 28 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 172
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 172 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{172}

"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's farm after three weeks, we start by calculating the number of cows and chickens added over the period.

First, we calculate the number of days in three weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added over 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added over 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Initially, the farm has:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ chickens} = 70 \text{ animals} \]

After three weeks, the total number of cows will be:
\[ 50 \text{ initial cows} + 420 \text{ cows added} = 470 \text{ cows} \]

And the total number of chickens will be:
\[ 20 \text{ initial chickens} + 210 \text{ chickens added} = 230 \text{ chickens} \]

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"
"To determine the cost per bagel after applying the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the total cost is:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost of $40.00. The discount amount is:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the final cost:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets with the 4 packs. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is:

\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per single bagel is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine how many potatoes Gomer ate, we start by calculating the number of scoops he consumed. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as:

\[
23 - 5 = 18
\]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We calculate 1 less than 3 as follows:

\[
3 - 1 = 2
\]

This means that 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require the same number of potatoes as 1 less than 3 scoops. According to the problem, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We calculate 3 less than 6 as follows:

\[
6 - 3 = 3
\]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion based on the given information:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"To determine the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we first calculate the total number of eggs consumed over the 60 days.

1. **First 30 days:**
   Chester eats 3 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs in the first 30 days} = 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

2. **Next 30 days:**
   Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs in the next 30 days} = 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

3. **Total eggs over 60 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total eggs} = 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert total eggs to dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs,
   \[
   \text{Total dozens of eggs} = \frac{240 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20 \, \text{dozen}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of green jellybeans, which is given as 17.
2. Calculate the number of red jellybeans, which is twice the number of green jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is \(2 \times 17 = 34\).
3. The total number of jellybeans is 60. To find the number of blue jellybeans, subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans. Thus, the number of blue jellybeans is \(60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9\).

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of lemons collected from one tree in one year:**
   \[
   \text{Lemons per tree per year} = 6
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of lemons collected from all trees in one year:**
   \[
   \text{Total lemons per year} = \text{Number of trees} \times \text{Lemons per tree per year}
   \]
   Given that Tim grows 5 trees:
   \[
   \text{Total lemons per year} = 5 \times 6 = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of lemons collected in a decade:**
   A decade is 10 years. Therefore, we multiply the total lemons collected in one year by 10:
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = \text{Total lemons per year} \times 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = 30 \times 10 = 300
   \]

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:
\[
\boxed{300}

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and total number of passengers. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84.

First, let's determine the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 9 = 14 \]

This means that the total number of passengers (84) is divided into 14 parts. To find the number of passengers per part, we divide the total number of passengers by the total number of parts:
\[ \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men:
\[ 5 \text{ parts} \times 6 = 30 \]
- Number of women:
\[ 9 \text{ parts} \times 6 = 54 \]

Next, we account for the 20 women who alight at the next stop:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we start by calculating the number of sunflowers sold per day.

1. **Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - From the sunflower sales: Faraday earns $2 per sunflower.
   - From the bouquet sales: Faraday earns $8 per bouquet, and each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = \(\frac{56}{8} = 7\) bouquets.
   - Number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day = \(7 \times 12 = 84\) sunflowers.
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day = \(\frac{26}{2} = 13\) sunflowers.
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers from sunflowers + Sunflowers from bouquets = \(13 + 84 = 97\) sunflowers.

2. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**

"Adam starts with $100 and buys rocks at $5 each, allowing him to buy 20 rocks. He then sells 60% of these rocks, which amounts to 12 rocks. Selling these 12 rocks at $7 each yields a revenue of $84. Initially, he spent $100 on the rocks, so after selling 12 rocks, he has $84 left. The loss is calculated by subtracting the remaining money from the initial investment:

\[
\text{Money lost} = 100 - 84 = 16
\]

Thus, the amount of money Adam loses is **$16**."
"To determine the total number of days Lauren will need to complete the project, we calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene separately and then sum them up.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for large-sized picture scenes is:
     \[
     \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - The number of days required for medium-sized picture scenes is:

"To determine the probability that both tickets are winners, we start by identifying the probabilities for each ticket individually.

1. **Probability of winning the first ticket:**
   The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   P(\text{Winning first ticket}) = 0.20
   \]

2. **Probability of winning the second ticket:**
   The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is:
   \[
   P(\text{Winning second ticket}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
   \]

3. **Probability that both tickets are winners:**
   Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
   \[
   P(\text{Both tickets are winners}) = P(\text{Winning first ticket}) \times P(\text{Winning second ticket})
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   P(\text{Both tickets are winners}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. **Expressing the probability as a percentage:**
   To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

"To find the total time of the cassette, we start by calculating the duration of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. Therefore, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to 5 minutes.

First, calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add this to the original 5 minutes:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 8 minutes long.

Next, add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
"To determine Linus's profit, we follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device:
   \[
   \text{Selling price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Determine the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = (2 \times 20) + (4 \times 20) = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit:

"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we start by finding the height of Carl's brother, Ned. Given that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, we can calculate Carl's height as:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we find the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the length of Carl's cane is \(\boxed{3}\) feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle of juice.
   - Therefore, 100% of a person's daily energy demand is covered by 5 bottles of juice (since 100% / 20% = 5).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - Each person needs 5 bottles.
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more bottles are needed:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - The number of additional bottles needed is:
     \[
     11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Thus, Hortex would have to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7300}

"To determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we start by calculating the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:

- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
\[ 1 + 2 = 3 \]

Now, we find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \).

The final numerical answer is:

So, the calculation is:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine the total amount of money Abraham will earn from selling his land, we will break down the sales step by step.

1. **First Sale:**
   Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50.
   \[
   \text{Area sold in the first sale} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   The price per square meter for the first sale is:
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

2. **Second Sale:**
   Abraham sold another 1/4 of his land for $30.
   \[
   \text{Area sold in the second sale} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   The price per square meter for the second sale is:
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

3. **Remaining Land:**
   After the first and second sales, the remaining land is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining area} = 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   Abraham sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from remaining land} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Revenue:**
   Summing up the revenue from all sales:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:

"To find Geb's age, we start with the given information: Haley is 26 years old, and Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[ G = \frac{1}{2}H - 10 \]

Substituting Haley's age (\( H = 26 \)) into the equation:

\[ G = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 - 10 \]

First, calculate half of Haley's age:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

Then, subtract 10 from this value:

\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Face masks per outing**: Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out, so for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.
2. **Face masks per day**: Tyrion goes out three times a day. Therefore, the number of face masks used per day is calculated as:
   \[
   3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ face masks/outing} = 6 \text{ face masks/day}
   \]
3. **Face masks in 2 days**: To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ face masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ face masks}
   \]

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the lengths of the ropes in terms of a variable. Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can express the length of the blue rope \( B \) as:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can express the length of the red rope \( R \) as:
\[ R = 4B \]

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

Substituting \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation for \( R \), we get:
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]

Now, substituting \( R = 4(Y - 7) \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + Y - 7 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]

Adding 35 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 6Y = 72 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given three times that amount, which is $15. After each of them gave an equal amount of money, say \( x \), to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money. This means:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

So, Ronnie gave $3 to their little sister. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

The final amount of money left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total, and there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), and purple paint as \( P \). Since \( R = W = P \), we can express the total amount of paint as:

\[ R + R + R + Y = 12 \]
\[ 3R + Y = 12 \]

We are also given that half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Substituting \( Y = 6 \) into the equation:
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the new box:**
   - The original box has 100 pods.
   - The new box has 20% more pods than the original box.
   - Calculate 20% of 100 pods: \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Add this to the original number of pods: \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod:**
   - The new box costs $12 for 120 pods.
   - Cost per pod: \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine the number of cycles that can be run for $1:**
   - Each cycle uses 1 pod.
   - Cost per cycle: $0.10.
   - Number of cycles for $1: \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) cycles.

Thus, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is 10.

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we can break down the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals Scored:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).

- One-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we find the number of girls and boys not on varsity.

- Number of girls not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

- Number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of students not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"To determine how many face masks Johnny bought, we start with the number of face masks Mike bought, which is 5. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. First, we calculate thrice the number of face masks Mike bought:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, we add 2 to this amount to find out how many face masks Johnny bought:

\[ 15 + 2 = 17 \]

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we start by identifying the number of teeth drilled and capped. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth. The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

Next, we calculate the percentage of James' teeth that are fixed. James has 30 teeth in total. The percentage of teeth fixed is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \(50\%\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To determine the refund amount Mr. Marcellus received, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased:**
   The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date:**
   Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk he purchased. The amount of milk returned is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned. Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the refund amount is:
   \[
   1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus received in refunds is:
\[
\boxed{5600}

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the given information. Let \( C \) represent Colin's current age and \( W \) represent Wendy's current age.

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have the system of equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]

Expand both sides:
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Thus, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

To verify, we substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
\[ W = 5(20 + 7) \]
\[ W = 5 \times 27 \]
\[ W = 135 \]

2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)
\[ 20 + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( 20 \).

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"Let's recount the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home:

1. **Initial apples**: Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 2

2. **First interaction**:
   - Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 1 (remaining apple)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1 (pocketed apple) + 1 (thrown apple) = 2

3. **Second interaction**:
   - Newton picked up the remaining apple, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 0 (all apples thrown)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 2 (pocketed apples) + 1 (thrown apple) = 3

4. **Third interaction**:
   - Newton picked up all the remaining apples (6 more apples fell out of the tree).
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 3 (pocketed apples) + 6 (picked up apples) = 9

Therefore, Newton brought home 9 apples.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost of Ali's order for 850 kilos of coal delivered in 50 kg bags at $18 per unit, we first calculate the number of bags needed:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is \(\boxed{306}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by her 6 friends. Each friend eats 6 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas required is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by her 6 friends. Each friend eats 4 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas required is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, which totals to:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to sum the miles he ran on each day of the week.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. Therefore, the total for these three days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}
  \]

- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. Therefore, the total for these two days is:
  \[
  5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}
  \]

Adding the miles from both sets of days gives us the total miles Sam ran this week:
\[
9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for his production rate and the rate at which the snowballs melt.

1. **Rate of Snowball Production:**
   Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Rate of Snowball Melt:**
   2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. In one hour (60 minutes), the number of 15-minute intervals is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 4 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of snowballs that melt in one hour is:
   \[
   2 \text{ snowballs/interval} \times 4 \text{ intervals} = 8 \text{ snowballs}
   \]

3. **Net Snowball Production per Hour:**
   The net number of snowballs Jay produces in one hour is:
   \[
   20 \text{ snowballs} - 8 \text{ snowballs} = 12 \text{ snowballs}
   \]

4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs:**
   To find out how many hours it takes to produce 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net production rate:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."
"Given that John is currently 28 years old and he was twice as old as Jim when the show came out, we can deduce Jim's age at that time. If John's age at that time was \(2J\), and we know John's current age is 28, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2J = 28 \]

Solving for \(J\):

\[ J = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Therefore, Jim was 14 years old when the show came out. Since no additional time has passed, Jim is still 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

14"
"To determine the total number of slices of apple eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother, we can follow these steps:

1. Doxa ate 1 slice.
2. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, which means her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
3. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, which means her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices eaten is:
\[1 + 2 + 3 = 6\]

Therefore, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"To determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we can trace the bandage usage and orders step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 + 100 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used \(81 - 78 = 3\) bandages more than they needed to reach 78 bandages.

Since they had 81 bandages after ordering and using 25, and they ended up with 78, it means they used 3 more bandages than necessary. This confirms the calculations.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{62}

"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly wage and her additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her daily earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Daily earnings = 7.5 hours/day * $1.5/hour = $11.25/day

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
- Jen works 6 days a week.

Weekly earnings = $11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.50/week

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, we calculate her total earnings for the month:
- Total earnings for April = $67.50/week * 4 weeks = $270.00

Additionally, Jen receives an extra $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she did not incur any absences for April, she will receive this bonus for 4 weeks:
- Total attendance bonus for April = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40.00

Finally, we add her total earnings for the month and her total attendance bonus:
- Total amount Jen will receive = $270.00 + $40.00 = $310.00

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{310}

"To calculate Jason's earnings, we'll sum the earnings from each task he performed over the two-week period.

1. **Earnings from doing laundry:**
   Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from laundry} = 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room:**
   Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} = 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Earnings from taking the trash out:**
   Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out each week. Since he took the trash out twice in the two-week period:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from taking the trash out} = 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:**
   Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher each time. Since he emptied the dishwasher 6 times:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher} = 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Jason earned is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we will sum up the entries step by step.

1. **Morning Entry:**
   - 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.

2. **Entry at 10:00:**
   - 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00.
   - These 40 people ordered the same amount of food as the first 50 people.

3. **Additional Entry:**
   - Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in later.
   - Number of people who came in later = \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

4. **Evening Entry:**
   - An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.
   - Number of people who came in evening = \(3 \times 50 = 150\).

Now, we sum up all the entries:

- Morning entry: 50 people
- Entry at 10:00: 40 people
- Additional entry: 80 people
- Evening entry: 150 people

Total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:

"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we start by calculating the number of red pens. Given that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we calculate the number of packs of black pens. Since she bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens, the number of packs of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Adding the number of red pens and black pens together gives the total number of pens:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To determine the total amount John spends, we start by calculating the cost per bottle of scotch. Given that he buys 10 bottles for $600, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we find the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the cost of the scotch and the cognac gives the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2400}

   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes:**
   - Total number of fish = 66
   - Number of fish with red stripes = 22
   \[
   \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44

Thus, the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we start by calculating the total number of eyeshadow colors she initially has:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with 6 colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

Adding these together, the total number of eyeshadow colors initially is:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

When her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors, the number of colors left is:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[\frac{6}{2} = 3\]

Subtracting these used colors from the remaining total, the number of colors left is:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. The cost price of the magazines is $72.

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99
   \]

   So, the selling price is $99.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
   \]

   Substitute the values:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27
   \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then sum these amounts over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the low setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day on the medium setting as on the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the medium setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day on the high setting as on the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the high setting for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \).

Now, we sum the total water removed over all settings:
\[
3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

   - Therefore, the second medicine amount is \( 3 \times 14 \) mL.

\[
3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL}
\]

2. **Total amount of medicine in one dose:**
   - The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicine amounts.
   - Therefore, the total amount is \( 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} \).

\[
14 + 42 = 56 \text{ mL}
\]

3. **Total amount of medicine in 8 doses:**
   - The total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 8 times the amount in one dose.
   - Therefore, the total amount is \( 8 \times 56 \text{ mL} \).

\[
8 \times 56 = 448 \text{ mL}
\]

Thus, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is \(\boxed{448}\) mL."
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we start by determining the capacity of Ali's class, which is given as 120 students.

Next, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes, which is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class:
\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Adding the capacities of Ali's class and John's classes gives us the combined capacity:
\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"To determine how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Stephen will return to his sister.
2. Determine the total amount Stephen will pay over the first 11 months.
3. Subtract the amount paid over the first 11 months from the total amount to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Stephen will return.**

Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. The interest amount is:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]
So, the total amount Stephen will return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet, given that it is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( C \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly made, and \( B \) represent the number of brownies. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which translates to:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Additionally, Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying and solving for \( C \):
\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Thus, Carly made 3 cupcakes. To verify, if \( C = 3 \), then:
\[ B = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \]

The total number of treats is:
\[ C + B = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:

"To determine the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to account for all the grapes used and eaten. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Grapes eaten by Madeline:** Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. **Grapes used by her brother:** Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. **Grapes remaining after her brother:** The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes remaining is the total number of grapes at the beginning minus 36.
4. **Grapes used to make pies:** Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Thus, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.
5. **Total grapes at the beginning:** Since the remaining grapes after her brother used his share are used to make the pies, we can set up the equation: \(\text{Total grapes at the beginning} - 36 = 48\). Solving for the total number of grapes at the beginning, we get \(\text{Total grapes at the beginning} = 48 + 36 = 84\).

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning is \(\boxed{84}\)."
"To determine the number of teachers at school that day, we start with the total number of teachers, which is 82. Out of these, 13 were sick, so we subtract the sick teachers from the total:

\[ 82 - 13 = 69 \]

Next, we add the 9 substitute teachers who were called in to help:

\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers at school that day is 78. 

The correct answer is 78."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we first calculate the weekly cost. Bud spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar cheese, and $6.00 on gruyere cheese. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

So, Bud spends $10.00 each week on making macaroni and cheese. There are 52 weeks in a year, so the annual cost is:

\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:

\[
\boxed{520.00}

"To determine the percentage of their day, on average, that the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we start by calculating the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total cleaning time is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total cleaning time into hours:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total cleaning time}}{\text{Workday time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

Therefore, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms. This result indicates that the custodian spends more than one full workday cleaning the classrooms in the given 5 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 250\% \]"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we first calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, which is \(20 - 5 = 15\) books. Therefore, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 10 + 15 = 65\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are required to hold all 110 books. We do this by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:

\[
\frac{110}{65} \approx 1.6923
\]

Since Elly cannot have a fraction of a bookcase, she needs to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, she needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To determine Rose's profit, we start by calculating the total cost of the eggs she bought. Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of eggs Rose has, which is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Rose sells the eggs at a rate of $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she can sell, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set is sold for $1, the total revenue from selling all the eggs is:

\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining hats after removing red hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Number of blue hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **Number of white hats**: Subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky in cents, we start by calculating the discounted price of the bag. The original price is $18.00, and with a $3.00 discount, the price becomes $15.00. Since the bag contains 30 sticks, the cost per stick is:

\[
\frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick}
\]

Converting this to cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

\[
0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents per stick}
\]

Thus, the cost per stick of jerky in cents is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we start by calculating the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test. The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct:

\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test. The total number of questions on both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to answer 70% of these 110 questions correctly:

\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes, we start with the given information:

1. Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes.
2. The number of blueberry cubes \( B \) is given by \( B = 5S - 4 \).
3. The total number of ice cubes is 116, so \( S + B = 116 \).

Substituting the expression for \( B \) into the total number of ice cubes equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96."

"To determine the total number of popcorn kernels that popped, we will break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial 30 seconds:**
   - 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate triples the initial rate.
   - Number of kernels popping = \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate quadruples the initial rate.
   - Number of kernels popping = \(4 \times 20 = 80\).

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate halves the previous rate.
   - Number of kernels popping = \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\).

Summing up the total number of kernels that popped initially:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Adding these to the initial total:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Thus, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:

- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.

\[
\text{Daily consumption for German Shepherds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we calculate the daily consumption for the Bulldogs:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.

\[
\text{Daily consumption for Bulldogs} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds to find the total daily consumption:

\[
\text{Total daily consumption} = 15 \text{ kg} + 6 \text{ kg} = 21 \text{ kg}
\]

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[
\text{Weekly consumption} = 21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is:

\[
\boxed{147}

"To determine the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals:
   - There are 10 2-legged animals.
   - Each 2-legged animal has 2 legs.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs for the 2-legged animals is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.

2. Calculate the total number of legs for the 4-legged animals:
   - There are 15 4-legged animals.
   - Each 4-legged animal has 4 legs.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs for the 4-legged animals is \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs.

3. Sum the total number of legs from both types of animals:
   - Total number of legs = \(20 + 60 = 80\) legs.

4. Convert the total number of legs into pairs:
   - Since each pair consists of 2 legs, the total number of pairs is \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) pairs.

Thus, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we start with the given information:

- The tower consists of 4 blue blocks.
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, which means there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks.
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

We can set up the equation to find the number of red blocks, \(R\):

\[ \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} + \text{Number of red blocks} = \text{Total number of blocks} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To isolate \(R\), we subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ R = 32 - 12 \]

\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the net distance traveled after his journey.

First, we calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- Elvis drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, we calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- Elvis drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we find the net distance from his starting point by subtracting the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:
54"
"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we will calculate the depreciation year by year starting from the initial value of $9000.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."
"To determine the number of pink candies, we start by identifying the quantities of each color of candy in the bag. We know the total number of candies is 232. The number of red candies is given as 54. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, which is \(2 \times 54 = 108\). The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, which is \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\).

Next, we calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
54 \text{ (red)} + 108 \text{ (orange)} + 27 \text{ (yellow)} = 189
\]

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[
232 - 189 = 43
\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"To determine the total cost Helen paid for her trip, we need to calculate the expenses for both the hotel and the bus rides.

First, we calculate the cost of staying at the hotel. Helen stayed for 3 nights, and each night costs $80. Therefore, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the bus rides. Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, each bus trip costs:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \]

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus rides is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Adding the total cost for the hotel and the total cost for the bus rides gives us the total amount Helen paid:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \]

Therefore, the final amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"
"To determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we start with the total number of marbles Mazie initially had, which is 52. After giving some marbles to Dallas and Darla, Dallas ends up with 17 marbles. This means the total number of marbles given to both Dallas and Darla is:

\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of marbles given to Darla. Since Dallas received 17 marbles, we have:

\[ x + 17 = 35 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 35 - 17 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"

"Josh runs a car shop and services 3 cars a day. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. He gets paid $4 per car. We need to determine how much he makes in 2 weeks.

First, let's determine how many days Josh is open in a week. He is open for 7 days - 2 days = 5 days per week.

Next, we calculate the number of cars he services in a week. Since he services 3 cars a day, in 5 days he services 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars/week.

Now, we calculate his weekly earnings. He gets paid $4 per car, so his weekly earnings are 15 cars/week * $4/car = $60/week.

Finally, we calculate his earnings for 2 weeks. His earnings for 2 weeks are $60/week * 2 weeks = $120.

Therefore, the amount he makes in 2 weeks is $120. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"To determine how much money Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of his collection separately and then sum them up.

1. Matthew has a total of 12 unique toy soldiers.
2. Half of his collection is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) toy soldiers.
3. The other half is also \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) toy soldiers.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each half:

- For the first half (6 toy soldiers at $5 each):
  \[
  6 \text{ toy soldiers} \times \$5 \text{ per toy} = \$30
  \]

- For the second half (6 toy soldiers at $7 each):
  \[
  6 \text{ toy soldiers} \times \$7 \text{ per toy} = \$42
  \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[
\$30 + \$42 = \$72
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Matthew would earn is:
\[
\boxed{72}

"To determine how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = \( 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \).

2. **Determine the net change in the number of holes per day:**
   - Nate's dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - Net change per day = \( 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of days required to fill all the holes:**
   - Total holes = 84.
   - Net change per day = 3 holes.
   - Total days required = \( \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \).

4. **Convert the total number of days into weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total weeks required = \( \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \).

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we start by calculating the enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1000}

"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family, we start with the total number of cookies, which is 7995. We know that 2595 of these are rainbow cookies and 3075 are oatmeal cookies. The number of chocolate chip cookies can be calculated by subtracting the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

First, we add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
\[ 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies:
\[ 7995 - 5670 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2325 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step with a clearer and more direct approach.

1. **Determine the number of test tubes Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes.
   - Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested.
   - Therefore, Igor gathered \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.

2. **Determine the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes.
   - Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
   - Therefore, Igor gathered \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.

3. **Determine the number of beakers Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers.
   - Igor gathered the correct number of beakers, which is 7.

4. **Calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:**
   - Test tubes: 8
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 16
   - Total gathered: \( 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \)

5. **Determine the number of items Igor lost:**
   - Total items requested: 16 test tubes + 7 beakers + 14 Petri dishes = 37 items.
   - Total items Igor gathered: 31 items.
   - Therefore, the number of items Igor lost is \( 37 - 31 = 6 \).

6. **Determine the number of beakers Igor lost:**
   - Since Igor gathered 7 beakers and lost a total of 6 items, he must have lost 1 beaker.

Thus, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we start by calculating the total number of screws required for all the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:

\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:

\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we start with the information given: the first basket contains 10 eggs, and the second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket. Therefore, the number of eggs in the second basket is:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Adding the eggs from both baskets together, we get:

\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

Thus, the total number of eggs in both baskets is:

\[
\boxed{30}

"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we start by calculating the individual contributions:

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each person to find the total amount raised:

\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

Calculating the sum:

\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480
\]
\[
1480 + 700 = 2180
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:

\[
\boxed{2180}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how long Vanessa took to complete her part of the race given the conditions.

First, let's denote the speed of Aaron as \( A \) miles per minute and the speed of Vanessa as \( V \) miles per minute. According to the problem, Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, so we have:

\[ A = 2V \]

Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Since Aaron's speed is \( A \) miles per minute, the distance he ran can be calculated as:

\[ \text{Distance Aaron ran} = A \times \text{Time Aaron took} = A \times 16 \]

Given that Aaron's speed is \( A = 2V \), the distance he ran is:

\[ D_A = 2V \times 16 = 32V \]

Since Aaron and Vanessa were relay race partners, the total distance they ran together is the sum of the distances each ran. Let's denote the distance Aaron ran as \( D_A \) and the distance Vanessa ran as \( D_V \). We know:

\[ D_V = 4 \text{ miles} \]

The total distance they ran together is:

\[ D_A + D_V = 32V + 4 \]

Since Aaron's speed is \( A = 2V \) and he took 16 minutes to run \( 32V \) miles, we need to find out how long Vanessa took to run her 4 miles. Since Vanessa's speed is \( V \) miles per minute, the time she took to run 4 miles is:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{D_V}{V} = \frac{4}{V} \]

We know that \( A = 2V \) and \( A \times 16 = 32V \), so we can solve for \( V \):

\[ V = \frac{32V}{4} = 8 \text{ miles per minute} \]

Thus, the time Vanessa took is:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 0.5 minutes to complete her part of the race. Converting this to a more standard format:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = 0.5 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we start by calculating the required line for the existing 200 feet of dock. Given that 3 feet of line are needed for every foot of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the 6 feet of new line that the caretaker already has from the total required line:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy an additional 594 feet of line. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{594} \]"
"To determine the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we'll follow a structured approach:

1. **Reservations per night**: The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
2. **Reservations per day**: Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the number of reservations per day is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ reservations/night}}{2 \text{ nights/day}} = 3 \text{ reservations/day}
   \]
3. **Reservations per week**: Over 7 days, the total number of reservations per week is:
   \[
   3 \text{ reservations/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]
4. **Cost per reservation**: Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. The total cost per reservation is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. **Total weekly revenue**: Multiply the number of reservations per week by the cost per reservation:
   \[
   21 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 315 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{315}

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we start with the cost price of $80 for 50 watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on this cost price.

First, calculate the profit amount:
\[ \text{Profit} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

Next, add the profit to the cost price to find the total selling price:
\[ \text{Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Finally, to find the selling price per watermelon, divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. James is currently 18 years old.
2. Dora is 9 years old because she will be 12 in 3 years.
3. James is twice as old as Dora, confirming James is 18 years old.
4. Since James is 18 years old and he is 19 years older than his father John, John is currently \(18 - 19 = -1\) years old, which is incorrect. We need to correct this: John is 18 years older than James, so John is \(18 + 19 = 37\) years old.
5. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.
6. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we start by calculating the rate at which each person peels oranges.

- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her peeling rate is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange per minute.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her peeling rate is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange per minute.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges each can peel in 60 minutes (1 hour):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Finally, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To determine the total cost Mark incurred, we start by calculating the discounted price of the radiator. The original price of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. Therefore, the discount amount is:

\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]

Subtracting the discount from the original price gives the discounted price of the radiator:

\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator. Thus, the total cost for the mechanic is:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Adding the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic gives the total amount Mark paid:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the equations derived from the given conditions. We have:

1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now, we have the simplified system of equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Substituting \( K = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how many slices of pizza each person can have, we start by calculating the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to share these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. Therefore, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
