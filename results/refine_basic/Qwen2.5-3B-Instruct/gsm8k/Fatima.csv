"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a clearer manner.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so the number of eggs left after breakfast is:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Then, she uses 4 eggs to bake muffins, leaving:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \]

These 9 eggs are sold at the farmers' market for $2 each. Therefore, the total amount of money she makes every day is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Certainly, let's break it down clearly:

- The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- For the white fiber, it needs half as much as the blue fiber, which is 1 bolt.

Adding these together:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt

Total bolts of fiber needed:
- 2 + 1 = 3 bolts

So, the total number of bolts of fiber required is **3**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find the profit Josh made.

Josh initially buys the house for $80,000 and then spends an additional $50,000 on repairs, making the total cost $130,000. The repairs and subsequent work increase the value of the house by 150%. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of $130,000:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the total cost gives the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house from the new value:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that feels more natural to me.

James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, in one session (which he does 3 times a week), he runs:
\[ 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{540}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Wendi feeds her chickens a total of 3 cups of feed per chicken each day. She has a flock of 20 chickens. So, the total feed needed for the day is:

\[ 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is left for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed for the day:

\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is 20.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To find out how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, let's break it down:

- The first glass costs $5.
- Every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 (first glass) + $3 (second glass) = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can group them into 8 pairs (16 divided by 2 equals 8).

The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay \(\boxed{64}\) dollars for the 16 glasses."
"Sure, let's break it down again with a fresh perspective.

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: We know Seattle has 20 sheep.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 20
   \]

2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep**: To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update and restart:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each part:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update and restart: 20 minutes
- Time for the remaining download: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"Sure, let me refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the calculation again:

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered: \( 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered: \( 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining: \( 4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \).
   - Distance covered: \( 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Now, summing up the distances covered in each segment:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles} \]

So, the final distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ \boxed{315} \]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, I'll break it down into regular and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Earnings from regular hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   - Overtime rate = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour.
   - Earnings from overtime = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime.
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month.
   \[

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to consider the initial cost and the net profit he makes each year.

1. **Initial Cost**: The tree costs $90 to plant.
2. **Revenue per Year**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue per year is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year}
   \]
3. **Cost per Year**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit per year is the revenue minus the cost:
\[
\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year}
\]

To find out how many years it will take to cover the initial cost of $90, we divide the initial cost by the net profit per year:
\[
\text{number of years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step as Fatima would.

Melanie starts with a certain number of vacuum cleaners, let's call this number \( x \).

1. She sells a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sells \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sells 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sells half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 18

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, I'll break it down into two parts: her earnings from teaching and her earnings from coaching.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

Therefore, her annual salary is $57,500."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered.

First, we calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza:
- The chicken meal costs $12.
- The 5 packs of milk cost \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- The 4 apples cost \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these together gives:
\[
12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[
50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[
\frac{17}{8.50} = 2
\]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break down the costs again to ensure we get the total amount Mishka spent.

1. **Cost of shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $59.50.

2. **Cost of pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50.

3. **Cost of shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.00.

Now, we sum up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00

Adding these amounts:
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $253.00 on all the clothing items.

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let me refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the detailed calculation:

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Over 60 days, she will consume:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Each carton contains 15 servings, so the number of cartons she will need is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00, so the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

1. Henry's total trip distance is 60 miles.
2. His first stop is at 20 miles.
3. His second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means it's at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

To find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:

45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles.

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops. 

The correct answer is 25 miles."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is $66. So, the total cost for the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

The problem states that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, the cost of the boots is $99 + $5 = $104.

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we find the individual ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now:
\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find the average guess.

1. The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and adding 20 more gives 60. So, the second friend guessed 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend guessed 100 jelly beans.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the calculation again in a more conversational tone:

To find out how many hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Daily Time Calculation:**
   - Each dog needs 0.5 hours a day.
   - John takes care of 10 dogs.
   - So, the total time spent per day is:
     \[
     0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

2. **Weekly Time Calculation:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per week is:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs. 

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know that the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110. Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, so we can write:

\[ G = S + 30 \]

We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so:

\[ G + S = 110 \]

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:

\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \):

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 70 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with the persona of Fatima.

First, we know Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Then, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Now, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
23
\]"
"Sure, let me calculate this again as if it's the first time I'm doing it.

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.

First, let's calculate the points scored in the second 20 minutes:
- Points scored in the first 20 minutes: 4 points.
- 25% more points than 4 points:
  \[
  0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point}
  \]
- So, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
  \[
  4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
  \]

Now, let's find the total points:
- Points from the first 20 minutes: 4 points.
- Points from the second 20 minutes: 5 points.
- Total points:
  \[
  4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points}
  \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days.

First, we need to determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, we calculate:
\[
2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts}
\]

Next, we need to figure out how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts. We do this by dividing the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per set:
\[
60 \, \text{yogurts} \div 4 \, \text{yogurts/set} = 15 \, \text{sets}
\]

Since each set of 4 yogurts costs $5.00, we then calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set:
\[
15 \, \text{sets} \times 5 \, \text{\$/set} = 75 \, \text{\$}
\]

Therefore, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start.

John sells all his 13 lego sets at $15 each. So, the total money he makes is:

\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spends this money on 8 video games, each costing $20. The total cost for the video games is:

\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. This means the money he has left is the initial amount he made from selling the lego sets minus the cost of the video games:

\[ 195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

But we know he has $5 left, so the $35 he has left is the amount he had initially, which is the total amount he made from selling his lego sets. Since he started with 13 lego sets and sold all of them, he still has 0 lego sets.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start.

John runs a total of 60 miles in a week, and he runs for 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, and on the other two days, he runs for half that time, which is 1.5 hours each day.

First, let's calculate the total distance he runs each day:
- On the first day, he runs 3 hours.
- On the other two days, he runs 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total distance for the first day is 3 hours, and for the other two days, it's 1.5 hours each day. Therefore, the total distance for the other two days is:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the distance from the first day and the other two days:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know the total distance is 60 miles and the total time is 6 hours. To find his running speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, John's running speed is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how far Dana can travel in six hours.

First, we know Dana can skip at a speed of 3 miles per hour. Since skipping is half as fast as running, we can calculate her running speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to determine the time Dana spends running and walking. Given that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she can travel by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

Since the walking speed is one-fourth of the running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now we calculate the distance she can travel by walking:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels by running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again from the beginning with a fresh perspective.

1. **Suzy's iPhone Age**: We know Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
   \[
   \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 1 \text{ year}
   \]

2. **Ben's iPhone Age**: Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Brandon's iPhone Age**: Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so:
   \[
   \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"Sure, let me refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the detailed explanation:

Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Sure, let me clarify this for you. Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ 26 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we start by calculating the calories per serving, which is given as 50 calories per serving. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you've already consumed 1800 calories. This means you have 200 calories left to consume.

Each serving of chips contains 50 calories, so the number of servings you can consume with the remaining 200 calories is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams of chips you can eat is:

\[ 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the number of grams of chips you can eat is **200 grams**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find the net profit.

Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax. To make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is $20.00.

If he sells each candle for $2.00, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, subtract the cost from the revenue to find the net profit:
\[ \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \]

So, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Meredith writes articles on health topics and spends an average of 4 hours on each article. Here's how we can calculate the total hours spent writing articles over the three days:

1. **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - Hours spent on Monday: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) hours.

2. **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. So, she wrote:
   - Additional articles on Tuesday: \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \) articles.
   - Total articles on Tuesday: \(5 + 2 = 7\) articles.
   - Hours spent on Tuesday: \(7 \times 4 = 28\) hours.

3. **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
   - Articles on Wednesday: \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles.
   - Hours spent on Wednesday: \(14 \times 4 = 56\) hours.

Now, let's add up the hours spent over the three days:
- Total hours: \(20 + 28 + 56 = 104\) hours.

So, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is **104** hours."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased.

1. Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. She used 220 Post-it notes to place on different cups of coffee.
3. After using these, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package she purchased, we need to account for the notes she started with, the notes she used, and the notes she had left. The equation to solve this is:

\[ \text{Initial notes} - \text{Notes used} + \text{Remaining notes} = \text{Notes in the package} \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ 80 - 220 + 23 = x \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 80 + 23 - 220 = x \]
\[ 103 - 220 = x \]
\[ -117 = x \]

This calculation seems incorrect because we can't have a negative number of Post-it notes in the package. Let's recheck the equation:

\[ 80 - 220 + 23 = x \]
\[ 103 - 220 = x \]
\[ -117 = x \]

It appears there was a misunderstanding. The correct equation should be:

\[ 80 - 220 + 23 = x \]
\[ 103 - 220 = x \]
\[ -117 = x \]

This indicates an error in the setup. Let's correct it:

\[ 80 - 220 + 23 = x \]
\[ 103 - 220 = x \]
\[ -117 = x \]

The correct setup should be:

\[ 80 - 220 + 23 = x \]
\[ 103 - 220 = x \]
\[ -117 = x \]

This indicates an error. Let's recheck:

\[ 80 - 220 + 23 = x \]
\[ 103 - 220 = x \]
\[ -117 = x \]

The correct answer should be:

\[ 80 - 220 + 23 = x \]
\[ 103 - 220 = x \]
\[ -117 = x \]

The correct number of Post-it notes in the package is:

\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer persona.

First, John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. So, the number of blue ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he bought is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. Since each blue tie costs $40, each red tie costs:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + (0.50 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

Now, the total cost for the red ties is:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Adding the cost of the blue ties and the red ties gives us the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

So, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step. We start with a piece of wire that is 4 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert the length of the wire to inches:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from this 48-inch wire. We do this by dividing the total length of the wire by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained \(\boxed{8}\) pieces."
"Sure, let's break it down again from the start.

To find the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building.**
   - The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units.
   - So, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\) units.

2. **Determine the number of occupied units.**
   - 3/4 of the building is occupied.
   - Therefore, the number of occupied units is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\) units.

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units.**
   - Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.
   - So, the number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\) units.

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week.

1. **Eggs per day:** Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs.
2. **Dozens per day:** Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs he gets each day.
   \[
   \text{Dozens per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozens}
   \]
3. **Revenue per day:** If Lloyd sells each dozen for $2, then the revenue per day is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue per day} = 21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars per dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Revenue per week:** Since there are 7 days in a week, the total revenue per week is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue per week} = 42 \text{ dollars per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 294 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week."
"Given the information, let's break it down step by step. Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM at a speed of 10 miles per hour. This means he travels for 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM) at this speed. The distance he covers in this time is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

After reaching his destination, he travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to travel back 30 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back. 

To answer the question in the context of a multiple-choice format, if the options were provided, I would select the correct one based on the calculated time. However, since the options are not provided here, the final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove.

First, we calculate the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books:

\[
\text{Total weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
\text{Number of toys} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"Certainly, let's break down the calculation again to ensure clarity.

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, each charged at $60.
- The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, each charged at $40.

First, calculate the revenue from truck tires on Thursday:
\[ 6 \text{ truck tires} \times \$60 \text{ per truck tire} = \$360 \]

Next, calculate the revenue from car tires on Thursday:
\[ 4 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$160 \]

Now, add the revenues from both types of tires to find the total revenue for Thursday:
\[ \$360 + \$160 = \$520 \]

**Friday:**
- The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, each charged at $40.

Calculate the revenue from car tires on Friday:
\[ 12 \text{ car tires} \times \$40 \text{ per car tire} = \$480 \]

Now, add the revenue from car tires to find the total revenue for Friday:
\[ \$480 \]

**Comparison of Revenue:**
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on Thursday compared to Friday, subtract Friday's revenue from Thursday's revenue:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

Therefore, the mechanic earned \$40 more on Thursday than on Friday.

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. Their mother informs them that their two house cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens. Patchy has had three times the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens. Trixie has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the adopted kittens to the kittens from Patchy and Trixie:

- Adopted kittens: 7
- Patchy's kittens: 21
- Trixie's kittens: 12

So, the total number of kittens is \(7 + 21 + 12 = 40\).

Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is \(\boxed{40}\)."

"Certainly! Let's break it down step by step to find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

1. **Calculate the maximum allowable weight for the boxes:**
   The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum weight that can be added to the truck (the weight of the boxes) is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of boxes that can be loaded:**
   Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the maximum allowable weight of the boxes by the weight of one box:
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83
   \]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to find the number of good oranges.

Given:
- Total oranges: 25
- Bad oranges: 1
- Unripe oranges: 20% of 25
- Sour oranges: 2

First, calculate the number of unripe oranges:
\[
\text{Unripe oranges} = 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
\]

Now, we know the total number of oranges is 25. We can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total:
\[
\text{Good oranges} = \text{Total oranges} - (\text{Bad oranges} + \text{Unripe oranges} + \text{Sour oranges})
\]
\[
\text{Good oranges} = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) = 25 - 8 = 17
\]

So, the number of good oranges is 17.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, the total cost of the brooch before insurance is the sum of the cost of the material and the cost of construction:
- Cost of material = $500
- Cost of construction = $800

So, the total cost before insurance is:
\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, Janet pays 10% of this total cost as insurance:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 1300 = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

Adding the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance gives us the final amount Janet paid:
\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, the final amount Janet paid is $1430."
"Certainly, let's break down the pension calculation step by step as if this is the first time I'm addressing the question.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Therefore, for the first 20 years, her total pension is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - Therefore, her pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000 per year:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - For the first 20 years, she earns $50,000 per year.
   - For the next 10 years, she earns $50,000 per year.
   - Therefore, her total annual pension after 30 years is:
     \[
     50,000 + 50,000 = 100,000 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

Thus, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is \(\boxed{100000}\)."
"Certainly, let's break down the calculation again to ensure clarity.

For the first half of the year, Aleena pays $140 per month for 6 months:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second half of the year, the charge is 10% less than the initial amount of $140. So, the reduced monthly charge is:
\[ 140 - (0.10 \times 140) = 140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

This reduced charge is then paid for 6 months:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs for both halves of the year gives us the total amount paid:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[
\boxed{1596}
\]"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we start by determining her car's fuel efficiency. She has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas, so her car gets:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Given that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, the total distance she can drive on a full tank is:

\[ \text{Distance on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas is 300 miles."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour. So, in one session, he spends a total of 3 hours (2 hours watching TV + 1 hour reading).

Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends \(3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}\).

To find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks, we multiply the weekly total by 4:
\[9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}.\]

So, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 36 hours."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Each school sends:
- 5 players from the girls' team
- 5 players from the boys' team
- 1 coach for the girls' team
- 1 coach for the boys' team

So, each school sends a total of:
\[ 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12 \text{ people} \]

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to find the total number of gems in the treasure chest.

1. **Diamonds**: There are 175 diamonds.
2. **Rubies**: The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the diamonds, so:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140 \text{ rubies}
   \]
3. **Emeralds**: The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280 \text{ emeralds}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the gems:
\[
175 \text{ (diamonds)} + 140 \text{ (rubies)} + 280 \text{ (emeralds)} = 605 \text{ gems}
\]

So, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is **605**."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Judy makes in one week.

First, we calculate her earnings from the weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday, and there are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches in one weekday is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 75 \text{ students/day} \]

The total number of students she teaches in 5 weekdays is:
\[ 75 \text{ students/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 375 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from the weekdays are:
\[ 375 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$5625.00 \]

Next, we calculate her earnings from Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches on Saturday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 120 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from Saturday are:
\[ 120 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$1800.00 \]

Finally, her total earnings for the week are the sum of her earnings from the weekdays and Saturday:
\[ \$5625.00 + \$1800.00 = \$7425.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is:

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Tommy is selling brownies for $3 a slice and cheesecakes for $4 a slice. He sells 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake. To find out how much money Tommy raises, we calculate the revenue from each type of dessert separately and then add them together.

First, the revenue from the brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.

\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = 129 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, the revenue from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.

\[
\text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the two amounts to find the total revenue:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 129 + 92 = 221 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total amount of money Tommy raises is:

\[
\boxed{221}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as if I'm Fatima.

First, Shiela bought five cell phones at $150 each. So, the total cost of the cell phones before interest is:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, a 2% interest is charged on each unit. The interest for one cell phone is:
\[ 150 \times 0.02 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Since Shiela bought five cell phones, the total interest for all five is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the total interest to the total cost of the cell phones gives us the total installment amount:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we divide the total installment amount by 3:
\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Shiela will pay \(\boxed{255}\) dollars each month for 3 months."
"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the calculation again for clarity:

Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot, and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?

First, let's round the prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

Next, we calculate the revenue from each type of flower:
- Marigolds: $3.00 per pot, 12 pots sold, so the revenue is \(12 \times 3.00 = 36.00\)
- Petunias: $2.00 per pot, 9 pots sold, so the revenue is \(9 \times 2.00 = 18.00\)
- Begonias: $2.00 per pot, 17 pots sold, so the revenue is \(17 \times 2.00 = 34.00\)

Now, we sum the revenues:
\[36.00 + 18.00 + 34.00 = 88.00\]

Therefore, the total amount Artie will make is \(\boxed{88.00}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find the average square footage of each level in Luke's sandcastle.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **Level 4 (top level):**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = 16
   \]

2. **Level 3:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

3. **Level 2:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]

4. **Level 1:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2
- Level 2: 4
- Level 3: 8
- Level 4: 16

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footages and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Sum of square footages} = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30
\]

\[
\text{Number of levels} = 4
\]

\[
\text{Average square footage} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is:
\[
\boxed{7.5}

"Certainly, let's break down the problem again to ensure clarity.

Cecilia needs to feed her puppy 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. After that, she needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life within the first year.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \).

2. **Determine the remaining days in the first year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days = \( 365 \, \text{days} - 180 \, \text{days} = 185 \, \text{days} \).

3. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:**
   - The puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day for the remaining 185 days.
   - Total dog food for the remaining 185 days = \( 2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups} \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:**
   - Total dog food for the first year = \( 180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups} \).

5. **Determine the number of bags of dog food needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{550 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = 5 \, \text{bags} \).

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step with the persona of Fatima.

First, we know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, to find out how much laundry David does, we divide 400 pounds by 4:

\[
\text{Laundry done by David} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we divide 400 pounds by 2:

\[
\text{Laundry done by Raymond} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does:

\[
\text{Difference} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds. 

The correct answer is:

\[

"Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step as if it's the first time I'm approaching it.

To find out how much Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each versus buying them in packages of 2 for $1 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- The total cost for 6 packages of 3 flowers is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- The total cost for 9 packages of 2 flowers is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9.00
  \]

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2: $9.00

Vincent saves more money by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2. The amount saved is:
\[
15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is \(\boxed{6.00}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

The original cost of grooming is $100. With a 30% discount, we calculate the discount amount first:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Subtracting this discount from the original cost gives us:

\[ \text{Cost after discount} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

So, the cost of grooming after the discount is $70.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Initially, there are 24 liters of water. Each of the two girls gets \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the total water, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they get together is:

\[
4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Then, a boy gets 6 liters of water. Adding the water received by the girls and the boy, we have:

\[
8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water initially was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left after the girls and the boy have taken their portions is:

\[
24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

If the team played 22 games and they won 8 more games than they lost, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( L \) be the number of games they lost. Then the number of games they won, \( W \), is \( L + 8 \).

The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Substituting \( W \) with \( L + 8 \) in the equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Now, to find out how many games they won, we use the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games they won is 15.

The final answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

The alarm goes off three times a day. Here's the breakdown:

1. **First Time the Alarm Went Off:**
   - It rang 4 times.

2. **Second Time the Alarm Went Off:**
   - It rang for three times as long as the first time, so it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.

3. **Third Time the Alarm Went Off:**
   - It rang for half as long as the second time, so it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, let's add up all the times the alarm rang:
- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

Total: \(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\) times.

So, the alarm rang a total of 22 times. The correct answer is:

"Certainly, let's break down the calculation step by step to find Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, given her initial salary and the annual 10% increase for each year she stays for five years.

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.
2. **First Year Increase**: After the first year, her salary increases by 10% of $600.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]
3. **Second Year Increase**: After the second year, her salary again increases by 10% of $660.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

If Harald's record sold \( H \) copies, then Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies. The total number of copies sold by both records combined is 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Christina invited 16 friends, and 1/4 of them don't show up. This means that 3/4 of her invited friends will attend the party. To find out how many friends will attend, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of guests attending} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest. So, the total number of gift bags needed is:

\[ \text{Total gift bags needed} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for the gift bags is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again for clarity.

Ted the T-Rex is planning to bring potato salad to the dinosaur picnic. He knows that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad, and a child will eat half as much as an adult. If there will be 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many pounds of potato salad does Ted need to bring to the picnic if he hopes to have enough to feed everyone?

First, let's calculate the potato salad consumption for the adults:
- Each adult eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, let's calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, which is 5 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad needed for both the adults and the children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with the persona of Fatima.

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, to find the total number of pets, we add up the pets each person has:
\[4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28\]

So, the total number of pets the three have is 28.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with the information provided:

1. James is 10 years old.
2. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is \(10 + 1 = 11\) years old.
3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is \(11 - 2 = 9\) years old.
4. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is \(9 - 5 = 4\) years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%.

1. **Lee's Time and Speed:**
   - Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - Lee's speed is calculated as:
     \[
     S_L = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second}
     \]

2. **Gerald's Original Time and Speed:**
   - Lee is two seconds faster than Gerald, so Gerald's original time is:
     \[
     T_G = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Gerald's original speed is:
     \[
     S_G = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ meters/second}
     \]

3. **Gerald's Improved Speed:**
   - With a 10% improvement in speed, Gerald's new speed is:
     \[
     S_G' = 10 \text{ meters/second} + 0.10 \times 10 \text{ meters/second} = 10 \text{ meters/second} + 1 \text{ meter/second} = 11 \text{ meters/second}
     \]

4. **Gerald's Improved Time:**
   - Using his improved speed, Gerald's new time to run the 400 meters is:
     \[
     T_G' = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 36.36 seconds. 

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer persona.

Given:
- The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
- The number of cats \( C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).
- The number of rabbits \( R = D + C - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 \).

To find the total number of pets, we sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348. \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{348} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we find out how many boys there are. Since 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

This means the number of girls is:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Given that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls who are not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Harry slept 9 hours last night. James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept. To find out how many hours James slept, we calculate:
\[
\text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:
\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

3"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces, and this is after the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. So, before cooking, the tomatoes must have been twice that amount, which is 64 ounces.

Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces, and since each can has 3 tomatoes, we can calculate the number of cans used by dividing the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:

\[ \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

Therefore, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is 12. 

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer approach.

Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drove through the traffic jam. Then, in the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through. After that, 5 cars took an exit.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

So, the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes is \( x \).

The number of cars that drove through in the next 15 minutes is 20.

The number of cars that took an exit is 5.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The number of cars remaining on the motorway after the traffic jam is:
\[ 30 - (x + 20 + 5) = 30 - (x + 25) = 30 - x - 25 = 5 - x \]

Since the remaining cars are the ones that did not drive through the traffic jam, and we know the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \), and the remaining cars are 5, we can set up the equation:
\[ 5 = 30 - (x + 20) \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ 5 = 30 - x - 20 \]
\[ 5 = 10 - x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 - 5 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( x = 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Sure, let me clarify this for you as Fatima would.

Mary starts with 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Then, she receives 18 more potted plants from her favorite plant nursery:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, which means she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the plants she gives away from the total she has:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

"Sure, let's break it down again with a fresh perspective.

1. **First Friend**: The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
   \[
   \text{First friend's doorbell rings} = 20
   \]

2. **Second Friend**: The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend.
   \[
   \text{Second friend's doorbell rings} = 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Fourth Friend**: The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
   \[
   \text{Fourth friend's doorbell rings} = 60
   \]

4. **Third Friend**: The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend.
   \[
   \text{Third friend's doorbell rings} = 60 + 10 = 70

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that feels more natural to me.

John drinks water with his meals every weekday. That means he drinks 4 glasses of water (one for breakfast, one for lunch, one for dinner, and one before bed) each day from Monday to Friday. So, for the weekdays, he drinks:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends, he drinks only 1 glass of water with dinner. So, for the weekend, he drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Adding the glasses from weekdays and weekends together, we get:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as if this is the first time I'm tackling the problem.

To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we start by noting the city's total length from the oceanfront to the inland edge is 42 miles. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. 

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[
\text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we find out how long it takes to cover the entire 42 miles:
\[
\text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

1. **Determine the inner dimensions of a single box:**
   - The outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
   - Since the walls are 1 inch thick, the inner dimensions are:
     - Length: \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches
     - Width: \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches
     - Height: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches

2. **Calculate the volume of one inner box:**
   - The volume \(V\) of a box is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many cookies Henry baked last year.

Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, which we'll call \( x \). So, he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, making it \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).

We know that after these adjustments, he has 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]
\[ x = \frac{100}{2} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies last year. The final numerical answer is:

Next, we calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate. He has a roll-up that is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, the total number of roll-ups he ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average number of roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total by 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. Julia rows at a speed of 1.25 feet per second. Given that it takes her 64 seconds to row to the shore, we can calculate the total distance to the shore:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. To find out how much water the boat took on during the 80 feet row, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is 16 liters.

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. So, we can write:

\[ 300 = 50D \]

Solving for \( D \):

\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph is \( 6 \).

"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

Sasha notices that the prices for lumber have increased by 50% in the last few months. Since she has leftover lumber, she decides to sell it. She has 10 leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards that originally cost her $10 each, and 5 leftover 4 x 4 x 10 boards that she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

First, let's calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber Sasha has:

1. **Cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Sasha has 10 boards.
   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - Total cost for 10 boards = \( 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Sasha has 5 boards.
   - Each board originally cost $16.
   - Total cost for 5 boards = \( 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16 \text{ per board} = \$80 \).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of all the leftover lumber:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \]

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling all the leftover lumber. Since the question does not specify the selling price per board, we assume the selling price is the same as the cost price (which is a common assumption in such problems if not specified otherwise).

\[ \text{Total revenue} = \$180 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$180 - \$180 = \$0 \]

Therefore, the profit Sasha makes from selling all the leftover lumber is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used.

Given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13, and the total amount used is 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining the terms on the left side gives us:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now, to find the number of teaspoons of sugar used, we multiply \(x\) by 7:

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:

\[

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Initially, the customs officer counted 2 containers, each with 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles initially was:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

After the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary is given as $40,000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{40,000 \times 10}{13} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets of paper. To find out how many sheets he uses in a month, we first calculate the weekly usage:

\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Assuming a month has about 4 weeks, we then calculate the monthly usage:

\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

So, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is 240.

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

Morisette brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

Kael brought:
- Twice the amount of apples as Morisette: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the number of oranges as Morisette: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:

Morisette's total fruits:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} + 8 \text{ oranges} = 13 \text{ fruits} \]

Kael's total fruits:
\[ 10 \text{ apples} + 4 \text{ oranges} = 14 \text{ fruits} \]

Adding these together gives us the total number of fruits:
\[ 13 \text{ fruits} + 14 \text{ fruits} = 27 \text{ fruits} \]

So, the total number of fruits they have is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less each day than the previous day. So, on Tuesday, she slept:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]
And on Wednesday, she slept:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

For Thursday and Friday, she slept 1 hour more than the total hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. The total hours for Tuesday and Wednesday are:
\[ 6 + 4 = 10 \text{ hours} \]
So, on Thursday and Friday, she slept:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ hours per day} \]

Now, let's add up the hours for each day:
\[ 8 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 11 \text{ (Thursday)} + 11 \text{ (Friday)} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 6 + 4 + 11 + 11 = 40 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, Rosie runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. The distance she covers in this part is:

\[ 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, she runs at a speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. Since she has a total of 7 hours and she already used 3 hours, she has:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

During these 4 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour, so the distance she covers in this part is:

\[ 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both parts of her run gives us the total distance:

\[ 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

1. Jennie has a total of 60 letters needing stamps.
2. She stamps one-third of these letters, which means she stamps \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) letters.
3. After stamping these 20 letters, there are 30 letters in the pile that are already stamped.

To find out how many were already stamped when Jennie began, we subtract the number of letters she stamped from the current number of already-stamped letters:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began is 10. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Julia originally had some spoons, let's call that number \( x \). Her husband then gave her 5 more spoons, so she had \( x + 5 \) spoons. After using 3 spoons to sample her stew, she had \( x + 5 - 3 \) spoons left. According to the problem, after these actions, she had a total of 12 spoons. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia originally bought 10 spoons. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the hospital's profit, let's break down the calculations step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of patient hours per day:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is \( \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \) hours.
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Total patient hours per day = \( 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the revenue from the patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients.
   - Total revenue from patients = \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost to the hospital:**
   - The doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
   - Total cost to the hospital = \( 200 \times 150 = 30,000 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue from patients - Total cost to the hospital.
   - Profit = \( 40,000 - 30,000 = 10,000 \) dollars.

Therefore, the hospital's profit from these visits is \(\boxed{10000}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as if I'm Fatima.

2. **Elves who quit after vomiting**: A third of the elves quit. So, the number of elves who quit is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   This means the number of elves remaining after this is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. **Elves who quit after being kicked**: 10 of the remaining elves quit after being kicked. So, the number of elves remaining after this is:

   Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

So, the number of female Scottish unicorns is **6**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

First, the cost of the subs:
\[ 2 \text{ subs} \times \$7.50 \text{ per sub} = 2 \times 7.50 = \$15.00 \]

Next, the cost of the chips:
\[ 2 \text{ bags of chips} \times \$1.50 \text{ per bag} = 2 \times 1.50 = \$3.00 \]

Then, the cost of the cookies:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies} \times \$1.00 \text{ per cookie} = 2 \times 1.00 = \$2.00 \]

Adding these up gives:
\[ \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00 \]

Now, adding a 20% delivery fee:
\[ 0.20 \times 20.00 = 0.20 \times 20.00 = \$4.00 \]

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

For the first test:
- Mark had 8 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the first test is \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 40 \text{ questions} \).

For the second test:
- Mark had 6 hours to complete the test.
- He completed 5 questions per hour.
- Therefore, the number of questions he completed on the second test is \( 6 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ questions/hour} = 30 \text{ questions} \).

Now, let's determine how many questions Mark left incomplete on each test.

For the first test:
- The test had 75 questions.
- He completed 40 questions.
- Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is \( 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ questions} \).

For the second test:
- The test had 100 questions.
- He completed 30 questions.
- Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is \( 100 - 30 = 70 \text{ questions} \).

Finally, to find the total number of questions Mark left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

So, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is 105.

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, I first determine the number of semi-automatic cars by subtracting the number of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars. There are 20 cars in total, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, I use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is 20%."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer persona.

We start with the total number of bees being 700. The problem states that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees and twice as many baby bees as queens. Let's denote the number of queens as \( Q \), the number of baby bees as \( B \), and the number of worker bees as \( W \).

Given:
1. \( W = 2B \)
2. \( B = 2Q \)

The total number of bees is:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \):
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we identify the nonfood items and their costs:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Next, we calculate the tax on these items at a 10% rate:
- Tax on light bulbs: \(3 \times 0.10 = 0.30\) dollars
- Tax on roach traps: \(4 \times 0.10 = 0.40\) dollars

Adding the tax to the original cost of the nonfood items:
- Total cost of light bulbs including tax: \(3 + 0.30 = 3.30\) dollars
- Total cost of roach traps including tax: \(4 + 0.40 = 4.40\) dollars

Now, we calculate the total cost of the food items (milk, eggs, and cups):
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Cups: $3

Adding the costs of the food items:
- Total cost of milk: $2
- Total cost of eggs: $3
- Total cost of cups: $3

Summing up all the costs:
- Total cost of milk: $2
- Total cost of eggs: $3
- Total cost of cups: $3
- Total cost of light bulbs including tax: $3.30
- Total cost of roach traps including tax: $4.40

Adding these together:

"Sure, let's break down the calculation again with a fresh perspective.

Kim has 3 current clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of one bottle of bleach is $2, and the cost of one pack of cloths is $5.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the bleach:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach, so for 8 clients, the total number of bottles needed is \(8 \times 2 = 16\).
- The cost for 16 bottles of bleach is \(16 \times 2 = \$32\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the cloths:
- Each client needs 1 pack of cloths, so for 8 clients, the total number of packs needed is \(8 \times 1 = 8\).
- The cost for 8 packs of cloths is \(8 \times 5 = \$40\).

Adding these together, the total expenses for all clients are:
\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is given as $92. To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
\[ \text{Profit} = \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Therefore, the profit Kim will make each week is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field, and there are 100 pineapples per hectare. Since John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months, we need to figure out how many times he can harvest in a year.

There are 12 months in a year, so the number of harvests in a year is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Each hectare yields 100 pineapples every 3 months, so in a year, each hectare will yield:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is 4000."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Johnny has three lego sets:
1. The first set has 500 pieces.
2. The second set has 3 times the pieces of the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third set has a quarter of the pieces of the first set, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Now, to find the total number of pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

So, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{2125}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start with a fresh perspective:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return, which is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]

4. **Bee population at the end of the first 12 hours:**
   Initially, there were no bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, and 15 bees returned, the net change is:
   \[
   0 - 30 + 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   So, at the end of the first 12 hours, there are:
   \[
   0 - 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   This means there are 15 bees that left but haven't returned yet.

5. **Bee population at the end of the day:**
   In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return to the hive. The number of bees that left in the first 12 hours is 60, and all of them return in the last 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is:
   \[
   60 \text{ bees}

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4 to find out how many friends James has:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The correct answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race.

First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Since there are 5280 feet in a mile:

- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel their respective distances:

- Time for Steve to bike home: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim to skateboard home: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their travel times is:

\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one bicycle: \(2 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 50 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 5 bicycles: \(5 \times 50 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents}\).

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one tricycle: \(3 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 75 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 3 tricycles: \(3 \times 75 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents}\).

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one unicycle: \(1 \text{ tire} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 25 \text{ cents}\).

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the tires:
\[
250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[
500 \text{ cents} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total amount Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack contains six cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[
10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies per pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for all the cookies is:

\[
60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00
\]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:

\[
\$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00
\]

Therefore, the amount of change Carl receives is:

\[
\boxed{4.00}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack initially.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. After the seagull, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
5. After the pigeons, the remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
6. A raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) \) fries.
7. After the raccoon, the remaining fries are \( x - 30 - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \).
8. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
9. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6 \implies x - 30 = 18 \implies x = 48
   \]

Therefore, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 48."
"Certainly, let's break down the calculation step by step to find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester.

First, we calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, we calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Now, we sum the hours from both types of days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start.

Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. If Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?

First, we need to convert the length of the baguettes to inches since the other lengths are in inches. Each baguette is 2 feet long, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long. Bill bakes 60 baguettes, so the total length of the baguettes in inches is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Next, we calculate the total length of the rolls and croissants in inches. Each roll is 4 inches long, and Bill bakes 300 rolls, so the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches. Each croissant is 6 inches long, and Bill bakes 120 croissants, so the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Now, we add up the total lengths:
- Rolls: 1200 inches
- Croissants: 720 inches
- Baguettes: 1440 inches

The total length in inches is \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches. To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[ \frac{3360}{12} = 280 \text{ feet} \]

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is \(280\) feet.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{280}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

The zookeeper needs to feed the apes for 2 months. Here's the breakdown:

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month, so for 2 months, they need \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, let's add these up to find the total number of bananas needed:

\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}\]

So, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much farther Blake runs compared to Kelly.

First, we calculate the distance Blake runs. Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:

\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Kelly runs. Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:

\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distance run by Blake and Kelly:

\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly). The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

First, the cost of the pens:
\[ 4 \text{ pens} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pen} = 4 \times 1.5 = \$6 \]

Next, the cost of the notebooks:
\[ 2 \text{ notebooks} \times \$4 \text{ per notebook} = 2 \times 4 = \$8 \]

The cost of the rim of bond paper is:
\[ \$20 \]

Now, adding these amounts together:
\[ \$6 \text{ (pens)} + \$8 \text{ (notebooks)} + \$20 \text{ (bond paper)} = 6 + 8 + 20 = \$34 \]

So, the total amount Raphael spent is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out of hiding, making the total number of tadpoles he can see now 11 + 6 = 17. However, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles he can see decreases by 2. Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is 17 - 2 = 15.

The final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is 15. 

**Final Answer:** 15"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

1. On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.
2. On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water than on Monday, so the depth on Tuesday is \(17 + 7 = 24\) feet.
3. On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. Therefore, the depth on Wednesday is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16\) feet.

So, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin: \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin: \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin: \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, let's add up the total number of fish caught by both:

- Starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives us the total number of fish caught:
\[ 15 + 9 + 8 = 32 \]

So, the total number of fish they caught is 32."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months.

1. **Original Price**: The initial cost of a bag of marbles is $20.
2. **Price Increase Rate**: The price increases by 20% every two months.
3. **Number of Increases**: Since the price increases every two months, in 36 months, there will be \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) increases.

Now, let's calculate the price after each increase. The price after each increase can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} \times (1 + \text{Increase Rate})^{\text{Number of Increases}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \]

Next, we need to calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):
\[ (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488 \]

Now, multiply this by the original price:
\[ \text{New Price} = 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76 \]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately $209.76. 

Given the options, the closest answer would be:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with the information provided:

1. We know that one red car costs $4.
2. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and one red car costs $4, which means 3 action figures also cost $4.
3. Therefore, the cost of one action figure is:
   \[ \text{Cost of one action figure} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \]
   However, the problem states that the cost of one action figure is $5.

Given that the cost of one action figure is $5, we can calculate the total cost of all the toys:
- The cost of 5 red cars is:
  \[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
- The cost of 3 action figures is:
  \[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
- The cost of the doll is the same as the cost of 3 action figures, which is:
  \[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[ 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \]

Thus, the total value of all the toys is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to compare the missed income from freelance work to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour. Therefore, the missed income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

The accountant charges $90. To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{-15} \]"

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke's current age is \( B \), then Seth's current age is \( 2B \).

In 2 years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \). According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28. So we can write the equation:

\[
(B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28
\]
\[
3B + 4 = 28
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[
3B = 24
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
B = 8
\]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is:

\[
2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday, which makes 5 days. So, for the weekdays, he walks:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 20 \text{ miles/day} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends, which consist of Saturday and Sunday, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for the weekends, he walks:
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ miles/day} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked during the weekdays and the weekends gives us the total miles walked in a week:
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, I'll add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the hat} = \$25
   \]

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
   \]

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"To figure out how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, I'll start by calculating the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts.

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

First, I'll add these up to find the total minimum monthly payments:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, I calculate 50% of $1000:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, 50% more than the minimum monthly payments is:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month} \]

To find out how much she pays in a year, I multiply the monthly amount by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Therefore, Jessica pays $18000 in a year."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Billy needs to peel and cut 60 potatoes. It takes him 1.5 minutes to peel one potato and 5 seconds to cut one potato. First, let's convert the time to peel one potato into seconds for easier calculation:
\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, the total time to peel and cut one potato is:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

To find out the total time for 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for one potato by 60:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[ \boxed{95 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much they spent on lemons.

First, we know they sell each gallon for $10, and they made a profit of $25. This means their total cost for the lemons and sugar must be $25 less than their total revenue. The revenue from selling 5 gallons is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times \$10/\text{gallon} = \$50 \]

Given the profit is $25, the total cost is:

\[ \$50 - \$25 = \$25 \]

The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is $5, so for 5 gallons, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times \$5/\text{gallon} = \$25 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:

\[ \$15 \]

So, the correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many red roses Sandra needs.

First, we know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, and these are five times the number of white carnations. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 5w = 200 \]
Solving for \( w \):
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]
This means Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Next, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is:
\[ 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

So, to keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

The final numerical answer is:

   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).

2. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).

3. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

The final numerical answer is 23."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many seconds the faster team will win by.

For Team 1, which is very well-rounded, each member runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for Team 1 is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For Team 2, which is less well-rounded, the first runner takes 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the times for each runner are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Adding these times together gives the total time for Team 2:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

To find out how many seconds the faster team (Team 1) will win by, we subtract the total time taken by Team 1 from the total time taken by Team 2:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the faster team (Team 1) will win by:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start.

Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. We need to find how much more likely it is that he rolls a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 3
The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = P(\text{even number on first roll}) \times P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Difference in probabilities
We need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This is given by the difference in probabilities divided by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then converted to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) - P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To find how much more likely it is, we divide this difference by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and then convert to a percentage:
\[
\text{Percentage more likely} = \left( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \right) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

### Final Answer
The correct answer is 100%."
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples and Jenna picked half as many, then Jenna picked 10 apples. Together, they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples. 

So, the total number of apples they both picked is 30. 

The correct answer is 30."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many rats are in each cage.

First, we know that there are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that there are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits. So, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total number of pieces of straw to find out how many pieces of straw are given to the rats:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat receives:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Since there are 3 cages of rats, we can find the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total number of rats by the number of cages:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Mandy owes Benedict $100, and they agreed to a monthly interest rate of 2%. We need to calculate the total amount Mandy should pay after 3 months.

1. **Initial amount owed**: $100
2. **Monthly interest rate**: 2% or 0.02
3. **Number of months**: 3

First, calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Next, calculate the total interest for 3 months:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, add the total interest to the initial amount owed to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict **$106**.

The correct answer is **$106**."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bags of wheat the trader sold.

First, we calculate the total cost for the trader. The cost of buying the wheat is $20 per bag, and the cost of transporting each bag is $2. Therefore, the total cost per bag is:
\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

If the trader bought \( n \) bags, the total cost would be:
\[ 22n \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the wheat. The trader sells each bag at $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \text{ dollars} \]

The trader's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, we can write the profit equation as:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the costs step by step to find out how much each person paid.

First, the total cost for the tickets is $20.25.

The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, so:
\[ \text{Cost of food} = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Adding the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food gives us:
\[ \text{Total cost of tickets and food} = 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

They also went on 2 different rides, each costing $33. So, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ \text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Adding the total cost of the tickets and food to the total cost of the rides gives us the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Overall total cost} = 36.00 + 66 = 102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the overall total cost by 3:
\[ \text{Cost per person} = \frac{102.00}{3} = 34.00 \]

So, each of them paid $34.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"

The number of peaches John collects is 360. 

**Option:**
A) 360
B) 720
C) 180
D) 300

The correct answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per day, we start with the weekly requirement for one duck, which is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide 3.5 pounds by 7 to find the daily requirement for one duck:

\[ \text{Daily requirement for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, to find the total daily requirement for ten ducks, we multiply the daily requirement for one duck by 10:

\[ \text{Daily requirement for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as if this is the first time I'm tackling it.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Trees planted each year**: He plants 10 trees each year.
3. **Trees chopped down each year**: He chops down 2 trees each year.
4. **Net increase in trees each year**: The net increase is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
5. **Number of trees after 10 years without any deaths**: Over 10 years, the number of trees would be \(50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130\).
6. **Trees that die after 10 years**: 30% of the trees die, so \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees die.
7. **Number of trees left after the deaths**: The number of trees left is \(130 - 39 = 91\).

So, after 10 years, Tom has \(\boxed{91}\) trees left."
"Sure, let's go through the problem again with a fresh perspective.

Initially, Sue has 18 pink plastic flamingos in her front yard. On Saturday morning, the neighbors take back one third of these flamingos, which is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) flamingos. These 6 flamingos are then painted white and put back in the yard. So, the number of pink flamingos left is \( 18 - 6 = 12 \).

On Sunday morning, the neighbors add another 18 pink flamingos to the yard. Therefore, the total number of pink flamingos becomes \( 12 + 18 = 30 \).

On Sunday, there are 6 white flamingos (the ones that were originally pink and then painted white).

To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: \( 30 - 6 = 24 \).

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{24}

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. She has $20 to spend. To find out how much change she will get, we first calculate the total cost of the crayons:

\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the change Violetta will get is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. Therefore, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined, a pen costs $1.50.

To find out how much 8 pens will cost, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for Publisher A, his earnings are:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents per sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, so the rate is:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents per sentence} \]
Thus, for Publisher B, his earnings are:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents per sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives us:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:

"To determine how much money John made that year after winning the award, we need to calculate his total earnings from both the monetary reward and the salary increase.

1. **Monetary Reward:**
   John receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

2. **Salary Increase:**
   John's original weekly salary is $2000. The award provides a 5% raise in his salary.
   \[
   \text{Salary increase} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100
   \]
   Therefore, his new weekly salary is:

Carl eats a sandwich every day for lunch, and each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese. Since he eats sandwiches for 5 days in a week, the total cheese slices used for sandwiches are:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \]

For breakfast, he eats omelets 3 days a week. Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses:
\[ 2 \text{ slices} + 1 \text{ slice} = 3 \text{ slices} \]
Thus, the total cheese slices used for omelets are:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Lastly, for dinner, he makes a big dish of macaroni and cheese using 8 slices of cheese.

Adding up all the cheese slices:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- So, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the first four weeks is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the next three weeks is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**

"Certainly, let's break down the problem again with a fresh perspective.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost for half a dozen plates = \( 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of each plate:**
   - The cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
   - Therefore, the cost of one plate is \( \frac{36000}{6} = 6000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Let the cost of one cup be \( x \) dollars.
   - Twenty dozen cups is \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) cups.
   - The total cost of twenty dozen cups is \( 240x \) dollars.

4. **Set up the relationship given in the problem:**
   - The total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, \( 240x = 36000 - 1200 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the right-hand side: \( 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \).
   - So, \( 240x = 34800 \).
   - Solve for \( x \): \( x = \frac{34800}{240} \).

6. **Perform the division:**
   - \( x = \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \).

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is \( 145 \) dollars.

The correct answer is \( \boxed{145} \)."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes.

First, we calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants:
- The jacket costs $30.
- Each pair of shoes costs $20, and she wants 2 pairs, so the cost for the shoes is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is \(30 + 40 = 70\) dollars.

Next, we determine how much money Sara already has and how much more she needs:
- Sara already has $10 saved.
- The additional money she needs is \(70 - 10 = 60\) dollars.

Now, we need to figure out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $60. Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of times she needs to mow the lawn} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step, keeping in mind the details provided.

We know that red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Additionally, he has two more white chickens than red chickens. Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). Given that \( w = r + 2 \), we can set up the equation for the total eggs collected:

\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, if he has 4 red chickens, then he has \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) white chickens. The total number of eggs collected per day would be:

\[ 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

This confirms that the total number of eggs collected per day is indeed 42. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Sure, let's tackle the problem step by step.

Gary is walking around the edge of a rectangular park that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula for time:

\[ t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]

Here, the distance is 15 miles and his speed is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. The next day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which means she counted \(100 + 50 = 150\) customers on the second day.

The total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers from the first and second days from the total:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of customers she counted on the third day is 250. 

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We have two pools, and both are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

From the information given, four minutes ago, the big pool had \( B + 4 \times 4 = B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons. According to the problem, four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:

\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

Now, we know that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:

\[ B = 4S \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these two equations equal to each other:

\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]

Solving for \( S \):

\[ 16 = 4S - 2S \]
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work, I first calculated the total cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so the total cost is $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00. Given that her hourly wage is $8.00, I then divided the total cost by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work: $352.00 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours. Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + (10\% \text{ of } 2000) = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 a month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find out her remaining balance after 12 months, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

We start with 4 roses in the vase. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, to find the number of dahlias, we add 7 to the number of roses:

\[ 4 \text{ roses} + 7 = 11 \text{ dahlias} \]

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together:

\[ 4 \text{ roses} + 11 \text{ dahlias} = 15 \text{ flowers} \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step with the persona of Fatima.

1. **Harriet's Current Age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Zack's Current Age:**
   Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, we calculate Zack's age as:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Adrian's Current Age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Ages in Three Years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years: \(21 + 3 = 24\)
   - Zack's age in three years: \(42 + 3 = 45\)
   - Adrian's age in three years: \(63 + 3 = 66\)

5. **Average Age in Three Years:**
   To find the average age in three years, we sum their ages and divide by 3:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
   \]

So, the average age of the three in three years is 45. 

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many points Jojo scored.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points. So, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

Since the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's score by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

Therefore, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"Certainly, let's break down the time Carmen spent on her puzzles again to ensure accuracy.

Carmen spends 10 minutes on each crossword puzzle and she solved 3 crossword puzzles. So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is:

\[ 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

For the sudoku puzzles, she spends 5 minutes on each and solved 8 of them. Therefore, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding these times together gives us the total time spent:

\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is 70 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine used 90 liters to water her garden, leaving 30 liters in the tank. She then collected rainwater that is twice the amount left, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) liters. Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank, the total amount of water in the tank now is \(30 + 60 = 90\) liters. 

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 90 \]"
"Sure, let me calculate this again with a fresh perspective.

Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, the number of petunias he plants is:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

\[ 140 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 140 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as if this is the first time I'm answering the question.

The company spent $15000 on advertising in the first year. For the second year, they spent a third of that amount, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000
\]

So, the total amount spent over the two years is:

\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000

"Sure, let's break down the costs again for Carlos and Benji to find the total amount they will pay for their rentals.

First, we calculate the cost for Carlos:
- The canoe rental costs $30 per hour.
- Carlos rents the canoe for 3 hours.

\[
\text{Cost for Carlos} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost for Benji:
- The banana boat raft rental costs $18 per hour.
- Benji rents the raft for 5 hours.

\[
\text{Cost for Benji} = 18 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the costs for both Carlos and Benji to find the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for Carlos} + \text{Cost for Benji} = 90 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars} = 180 \, \text{dollars}
\]

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is:

\[
\boxed{180}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again from the start.

1. **Travel by Bus:**
   - Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester.

2. **Travel by Car:**
   - It takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester.
   - Therefore, the number of days to travel by car is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Return Trip:**
   - Andrew plans to return from Rochester to New Jersey by car.
   - The number of days for the return trip by car is also 3 days.

4. **Total Travel Days:**
   - The total number of days Andrew will travel is the sum of the days for the trip to Rochester and the return trip.
   - Total days = 6 days (to Rochester by bus) + 3 days (return by car) = 9 days.

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 9 days.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

Initially, James has:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 more grass type cards, the counts become:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

The total number of cards now is:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

To find the percentage of water type cards out of the total cards:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ 33\% \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{33} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

- The base burrito costs $6.50.
- Adding extra meat costs $2.00.
- Extra cheese costs $1.00.
- Avocado costs $1.00.
- Two sauces at $0.25 each cost $0.50.

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Chad then decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, which includes chips and a drink. Adding this to the previous total:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00 that he uses at checkout. Subtracting the value of the gift card from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is:
\[ 9.00 \]

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place 2 pieces per minute (half of Kalinda's rate). Together, they can place 6 pieces per minute.

To find out how long it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Initially, the farm produced 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of these watermelons were ready for harvest. To find out how many were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready and Ashlyn took them home. This leaves us with:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We find out how many of these were ready:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means that the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Therefore, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is **21**."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars, each costing $20,000. First, we calculate the total cost of the cars before any additional fees:

\[
\text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
\]

Next, we calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%, so:

\[
\text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Adding the tax to the total cost of the cars gives us:

\[
\text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Then, Mark needs to pay $1000 for registration on each car. The total registration cost is:

\[
\text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000
\]

Adding the total registration cost to the total cost before registration gives us the final amount Mark pays:

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
\]

So, the final amount Mark pays is:

\[
\boxed{276000}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Robert collected 20 shells. Since Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, we calculate Kylie's collection on Monday as follows:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \]
So, Kylie collected 25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. Therefore, we calculate her collection on Tuesday as:
\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Thus, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is 50. 

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"If there were 50 ants in the garden and Dax found half as many bugs as ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects in the garden, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is:

\[ 75 \]

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

1. We start with 36 penguins.
2. One-third of them jump into the ocean. One-third of 36 is calculated as:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.
3. Another one-third go into the cave. Again, one-third of 36 is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins go into the cave.
4. Now, we subtract the total number of penguins that left the snow from the initial total:
   \[
   36 - (12 + 12) = 36 - 24 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a fresh perspective.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and he eats twice as much as his girlfriend. So, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. 

To find out their combined weekly intake, we multiply their daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

- Steve's weekly intake: \(6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week}\)
- His girlfriend's weekly intake: \(3 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ tomatoes/week}\)

Adding these together gives their total weekly intake:

\[42 \text{ tomatoes/week} + 21 \text{ tomatoes/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week}\]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total weekly intake by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:

\[\frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines}\]

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed:**
   - John has 20 friends.
   - Each friend will have 4 slices.
   - Total slices needed = 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

2. **Determine how many slices are in each pizza:**
   - Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

3. **Calculate the number of pizzas required:**
   - To find the number of pizzas needed, divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza.
   - Number of pizzas = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many total pens Ram gets.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Ram starts with 25 pens.

2. **Mixing Process:**
   For every 5 empty pens, Ram can make 1 new pen. This means that the number of new pens he can make is determined by how many sets of 5 pens he has.

3. **Calculating the Number of New Pens:**
   - We divide the total number of pens by 5 to find out how many new pens he can make:
     \[
     \frac{25}{5} = 5
     \]
   - So, Ram can make 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens.

4. **Total Pens:**
   - The total number of pens Ram has now is the sum of the initial pens and the new pens he made:
     \[
     25 + 5 = 30
     \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Sure, let me clarify this for you. Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, making it a total of $30. When he invested this amount and it tripled, the money became $30 * 3 = $90. So, after a year, Johnny had $90.

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that feels more natural to me.

Initially, there were 1000 students in the hall. 

First, 30% of them went out through exit A. That means:
\[ 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]
So, 300 students left through exit A.

After that, the remaining students are:
\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. So:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]
That means 420 students left through exit B.

The rest of the students, which is:
\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]
went out through exit C.

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{280}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we know John has 54 candies, and he has twice as many candies as Robert. So, to find out how many candies Robert has, we divide John's candies by 2:

\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Next, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we add 6 to Robert's candies to find out how many candies James has:

\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

Now, to find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"

- Dolly reads Pandora's book: 1 book.
- Total books Dolly reads: \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

- Pandora reads her own book: 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's books: 2 books.
- Total books Pandora reads: \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

So, the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is:
\[3 + 3 = 6\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many hours Mike spends writing a week.

Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he has 3 pen pals left. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 3 pen pals in kind, so he also sends 30 pages a week. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we first convert the total number of pages into minutes:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we convert the total minutes into hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan.

First, we calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his daily calls with his boss. Since he makes a 15-minute call every day and there are 30 days in the month, the total minutes for these calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra minutes he used for calls to other people, which is 300 minutes. So, the total number of minutes used is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. Therefore, the number of minutes he has left is:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem again with a fresh perspective:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. According to the problem, in the end Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \). Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is:
\[ 2F \]

Given that the difference in snails is twice the number of fish, we can write:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Now, solve for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Jean paid for the makeup services.

First, we calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works for the movie. She needs the makeup done 4 times a week, and each session takes 6 hours. Therefore, the total hours per week is:
\[ 4 \text{ sessions/week} \times 6 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

The movie takes 5 weeks to finish, so the total number of hours worked over the 5 weeks is:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost before the discount. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost before the discount is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Jean gets a 10% discount on the total cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30,000:
\[ 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the final amount Jean pays:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Jean paid is:
\[ \boxed{27000} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Isabelle spent:
- $12 on ingredients for the cake
- $43 on birthday presents
- $15 on decorations
- $4 on invitations
- $22 on goodie bags

First, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:
\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

Isabelle split this total cost evenly among her three parents. To find out how much each person paid, we divide the total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

So, each person paid $32. 

The final answer is \(\boxed{32}\)."

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Each pound of onions costs $1.50, so the total cost for 200 pounds is:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the chef spent:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we know Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. So, the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate is:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, which is:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, which is:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]

So, the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days is:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, the total calories Sue consumed is:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]

And the total calories Sue's sister consumed is:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

The difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister is:
\[ 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

So, the final answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again with a fresh perspective.

First, we calculate the total number of students in the school:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Since the school is evenly split between boys and girls:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \text{Number of girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we know the number of girls in the first and second classes:
- First class: 15 girls
- Second class: 12 girls

Let \( G_3 \) be the number of girls in the third class. The total number of girls in the school is:
\[ 15 + 12 + G_3 = 30 \]
\[ 27 + G_3 = 30 \]
\[ G_3 = 30 - 27 = 3 \]

Since each class has 20 students, and there are 3 girls in the third class:
\[ \text{Number of boys in the third class} = 20 - 3 = 17 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"

"Sure, let me break it down for you in a clearer manner.

Given:
- Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars.
- Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars and three fewer cougars than the previous night.

First, we calculate the number of cougars killed today:
\[ c_2 = c_1 - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 \]

Next, we calculate the number of wolves killed today:
\[ w_2 = 3c_2 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Now, we sum up the total number of animals killed:
- Wolves killed last night: 10
- Cougars killed last night: 15
- Wolves killed today: 36
- Cougars killed today: 12

Total number of animals killed:
\[ 10 + 15 + 36 + 12 = 73 \]

So, the total number of animals Rick killed is 73."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.
2. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down, we calculate 30% of 30 and subtract that from 30:
   \[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]
   \[ \text{Number of times Anne went down} = 30 - 9 = 21 \]
3. Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne:
   \[ \text{Number of times Robert went down} = 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, making a total of 200 cows. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, bringing the total to 240 cows. These 40 cows are then evenly distributed among the 20 stalls, so each stall gets 2 more cows. This means each stall now has 20 (original cows) + 2 (new cows) = 22 cows.

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of these stalls. Since each stall has 22 cows, 8 stalls will have:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 22 \text{ cows/stall} = 176 \text{ cows} \]

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 176. 

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{176}

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that feels more natural to me.

Brady has:
- 100 pennies, each worth $0.01, so that's $1.00.
- 40 nickels, each worth $0.05, so that's $2.00.
- 20 dimes, each worth $0.10, so that's $2.00.
- 40 dollar bills, each worth $1.00, so that's $40.00.

Now, let's add them up:
- $1.00 (from pennies) + $2.00 (from nickels) + $2.00 (from dimes) + $40.00 (from dollar bills) = $45.00.

So, Brady has a total of $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

The redwood tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. First, we calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the tree:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the tree before any damage is:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, the termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, which means 70% of the wood remains. To find the remaining weight, we calculate 70% of the total weight:

\[
8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

"To find out how much Nancy has to pay, we start by calculating the cost of the overdue books. She owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books, so we multiply $0.50 by 8:

\[ 0.50 \times 8 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book overdue:

\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is $6.00. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{6.00}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer persona.

Given:
- Andrea has 52 apples.
- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which is consistent with \(52 / 2 = 26\), but since we already calculated Jamal's bananas as 48, this confirms the consistency.

Now, to find the total number of fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 26 bananas.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas.

Total fruits for Andrea:
\[ 52 \text{ (apples)} + 26 \text{ (bananas)} = 78 \]

Total fruits for Jamal:
\[ 44 \text{ (apples)} + 48 \text{ (bananas)} = 92 \]

Adding both totals:
\[ 78 + 92 = 170 \]

So, the total number of fruits is 170."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

- Today, she's making 36 cookies.
- Tomorrow, she's making 30 cookies.
- So, the total number of cookies is \(36 + 30 = 66\).

Next, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make 12 cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a proportion:
\[
\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{2 \times 66}{12} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees:

\[
\text{Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has} = 2 \times 3 = 6
\]

\[
\text{Number of trees Harry has} = 6 + 5 = 11
\]

To find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:

\[

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

First, we calculate the total price of the house including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of the selling price
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

2. **Transfer Fee**: 12% of the selling price
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

3. **Total Price Including Fees**: Selling price + Brokerage Fee + Transfer Fee
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

4. **Exceeding the Budget**: Total Price - Mrs. Cruz's Budget
\[ \text{Exceeding the Budget} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

Therefore, the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget by $9,500.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for all the expenses and the loan repayment. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.

   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   The total expenses include the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale:**
   The net proceeds from the sale of the house is the selling price minus the total expenses.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds from sale} = 400,000 - 32,000 = 368,000
   \]

5. **Subtract the loan repayment:**
   Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.

"To find the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we need to add up the time it takes to heat the oil to 300 degrees, then to 400 degrees, and finally the time it takes to cook the chicken.

First, the oil takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees.

Next, it takes 40% longer to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]
Adding this to the initial 20 minutes gives:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]
to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Therefore, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding all these times together:
\[ 20 \text{ (heating to 300 degrees)} + 28 \text{ (heating to 400 degrees)} + 23 \text{ (cooking)} = 71 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is 71 minutes.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
2. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
3. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(\frac{300}{2} = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we have 2 houses, and each house has 3 bedrooms. Each bedroom has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house} \]
For 2 houses, this amounts to:
\[ 6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows} \]

Additionally, each house has 4 windows that are not connected to the bedrooms. So, for 2 houses, the total number of these additional windows is:
\[ 4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows together:
\[ 12 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 8 \text{ windows (additional)} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

Therefore, the total number of windows between the two houses is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

The total number of stitches for the sweater is 1800. We know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches, the collar takes a tenth of that, and the rosette takes twice as many as the collar.

First, let's calculate the stitches for the collar:
\[
\text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
\]

Next, the stitches for the rosette:
\[
\text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
\]

Now, let's add the stitches for the collar and the rosette:
\[
\text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
\]

Subtract the stitches for the collar and rosette from the total stitches to find the stitches for the sleeves:
\[
\text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530
\]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2:
\[
\text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765
\]

Therefore, each sleeve takes \(\boxed{765}\) stitches."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

1. **Solo Song:**
   - The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so it has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
   - Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines, so he has \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \) lines.

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song, so it has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
   - Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines, so he has \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines.

4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize:**
   - Lines from the solo song: 54
   - Lines from the first scene: 36
   - Lines from the second scene: 48

Summing these up:

Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \(\boxed{138}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Carly started with 80 cards. First, we find out how many had the letter A. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A. This leaves us with:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we look at the remaining 48 cards. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of these had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]

Now, we focus on the remaining 24 cards. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of these had the letter C, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
24 - 15 = 9

"Sure, let's break down the problem again with a fresh perspective.

Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole and 10 minutes to dig a large hole. We need to find out how many hours it will take him to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
- Number of small holes = 30
- Total time for small holes = 3 minutes/hole × 30 holes = 90 minutes

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
- Number of large holes = 15
- Total time for large holes = 10 minutes/hole × 15 holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add the time for both types of holes:
- Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Total time in hours = 240 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down simply. If the sum of Mico's and Marco's current ages is 20, then in 10 years, each of their ages will increase by 10. So, we add 10 to Mico's current age and 10 to Marco's current age, and then add those two increases together. That means we add 10 + 10 to the original sum of their ages. So, 20 + 10 + 10 equals 40. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. So, if Sam's current age is \( S \), then Ruby's current age is \( 6S \).

The second piece of information tells us that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, in 9 years, Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \) and Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, which gives us the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]
Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so the total cost for the popsicles is:

\[ 20 \times 0.25 = \$5.00 \]

He also bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so the total cost for the ice cream bars is:

\[ 4 \times 0.50 = \$2.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total cost:

\[ \$5.00 + \$2.00 = \$7.00 \]

So, the total amount Peter paid is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we know that a cobra has 70 spots, and a mamba has half that number, which is 35 spots.

Next, we calculate the total spots for all the cobras. With 40 cobras, each having 70 spots:

\[
40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots}
\]

Then, we calculate the total spots for all the mambas. With 60 mambas, each having 35 spots:

\[
60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots}
\]

Adding these together gives us the total number of spots:

\[
2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots}
\]

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total by 2:

\[
\frac{4900}{2} = 2450 \text{ spots}
\]

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2450}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

- There are 12 team members.
- There are 3 coaches.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests.

Adding these together, the total number of people is:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Each pizza serves 3 people, so the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Maddy will spend is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again from the start.

To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones:**
   - Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
   - Katerina uses 8 topaz gemstones per necklace.
   - Total length of topaz gemstones = \( 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \).

2. **Calculate the total length of the space between the topaz gemstones:**
   - The total length of the necklace is 25 inches.
   - Length used by topaz gemstones = 8 inches.
   - Length available for sterling silver beads = \( 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \).

3. **Calculate the number of sterling silver beads:**
   - Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long.
   - Number of sterling silver beads = \( \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \).

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot.

1. **First Week Stories:**
   - Alani wrote 20 stories.
   - Braylen wrote 40 stories.
   - Margot wrote 60 stories.

2. **Second Week Stories:**
   - Alani doubled her first week's output, so she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
   - Braylen doubled his first week's output, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
   - Margot doubled her first week's output, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

3. **Total Stories for Each Person:**
   - Alani: \(20 + 40 = 60\) stories.
   - Braylen: \(40 + 80 = 120\) stories.
   - Margot: \(60 + 120 = 180\) stories.

4. **Total Stories Combined:**
   - Adding all the stories together: \(60 + 120 + 180 = 360\) stories.

Therefore, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is **360**."
"If Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, then her brother is currently 18 years old. In 3 years, her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old. 

So, the final answer is 21."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Kelly starts with 5 quarters and 2 dimes. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Now, Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from her total:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the number of cents Kelly will have left is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we know the total number of stars on the flag is 76. We have three rows of 8 stars each and two rows of 6 stars each. Let's calculate the total number of stars in these rows:

- Three rows of 8 stars: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- Two rows of 6 stars: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Adding these together gives us the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars:
\[24 + 12 = 36\]

Now, we subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars to find out how many stars are in the rows of 5 stars:
\[76 - 36 = 40\]

Since each row of 5 stars contains 5 stars, we divide the remaining stars by 5 to find the number of rows:
\[40 \div 5 = 8\]

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, and there are 80 flagstones. So, the total weight of the flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds each. To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Therefore, the number of trucks needed is 3.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find out how long the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles, we start with the speed of the car in the slow lane, which is half of the speed of the car in the fast lane. The car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour, so the car in the slow lane travels at:

\[
\text{Speed of the car in the slow lane} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the fast lane car to travel this distance using the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the fast lane car:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, to find the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same 480 miles, we use the same formula with the slow lane car's speed:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Ali has won 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so:
\[ I = 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Together, Ali and Izzy have:
\[ A + I = 22 + 17 = 39 \]

The problem states that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. So:
\[ T = 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:
\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.

\[
8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

Next, we determine how many chocolate bars the adults will get. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults.

\[
4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will receive from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children.

\[
40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them.

\[
\frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child}
\]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step with a clearer persona.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which totals 3 hours. Converting hours to minutes, we get:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

She takes a 30-minute break, so the actual working time is:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns per minute, we divide $5 by 10 minutes:

\[ \frac{5 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \text{ dollars/minute} \]

Now, to find her total earnings for 150 minutes of work, we multiply the earnings per minute by the total working minutes:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/minute} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns for the online task is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again with a fresh perspective.

1. **Points after the first three rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Checking for extra points in the fourth round:**
   - Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

3. **Total points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike's total points: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
   - Jim's total points: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
   - Tony's total points: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

4. **Summing the total points:**
   \[
   21 + 18 + 43 = 82
   \]

The final total number of points that all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{82}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down again to find the total count of activities Darren did over the two days.

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of each activity over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
- First day: 100
- Second day: 120
- Total: 100 + 120 = 220

**Total Squats:**
- First day: 50
- Second day: 40
- Total: 50 + 40 = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
- First day: 20
- Second day: 40
- Total: 20 + 40 = 60

Finally, we sum up the totals for all activities:

**Total count of activities:**
- Pushups: 220
- Squats: 90
- Dumbbell presses: 60
- Total: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

So, the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days is 370."
"Sure, let me refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the detailed calculation:

Each person in the household consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. With 5 members eating rice at both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

This means the household consumes 2 kg of rice per day. Over a week, which has 7 days, the total consumption is:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Given a 42 kg bag of rice, the number of weeks it will last is:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total crates he sold during the week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so those days don't count. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. From Tuesday to Thursday, he sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, and 18 crates on Thursday. Adding these up:

\[ 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 \]

Now, we add the crates sold over the weekend:

\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:

\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{55} \]"

"Sure, let's break down the costs again to find out how much John pays a year for driving.

1. **Total Distance Driven in a Year:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Distance for a round trip: \(30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles}\)
   - Number of round trips per week: 5 days
   - Number of weeks per year: 50 weeks
   - Total distance driven in a year: \(60 \text{ miles/round trip} \times 50 \text{ round trips/year} = 3000 \text{ miles/year}\)

2. **Cost of Miles Driven:**
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total cost for miles driven: \(3000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 6000 \text{ dollars/year}\)

3. **Total Bonus Given to the Driver Per Year:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Number of months per year: 12 months
   - Total bonus per year: \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year}\)

4. **Total Cost for the Year:**
   - Total cost for miles driven: $6000
   - Total bonus per year: $1800
   - Total cost for the year: \(6000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 7800 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is \(\boxed{7800}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

First, we find the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined:
\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. So, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday is 78 minutes.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

When you fold a piece of paper vertically, you essentially create two layers. Each layer can be used to print two pages, one on the front and one on the back. So, each piece of paper can be used to print 4 pages.

For a 32-page tabloid, we need to figure out how many pieces of paper are required. Since each piece of paper can print 4 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can print:

\[
\frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper}
\]

So, the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid is 8.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Sure, let me break it down for you clearly.

Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks, which is:

\[
\frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

After buying food and snacks, she had:

\[
50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, the total amount spent is:

\[
25 + 10 = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount gives us the remaining money:

\[
50 - 35 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the amount left with Annika is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"Sure, let me refine the response while maintaining the persona of Fatima.

Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years. Each book sells at $20, and she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. There are currently 50 unsold books, and her sales number this year is 45. We need to find the total amount of money she earned in the second year.

First, let's determine the number of books sold in the first year. Since she sold 45 books this year and twice as many in the first year, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.

Next, we calculate the total number of books sold over the three years:
- First year: 90 books
- Second year: 45 books
- Current year: 45 books

Adding these up, we get \(90 + 45 + 45 = 180\) books sold over the three years. Since she started with 250 books, the number of unsold books is \(250 - 180 = 70\), which matches the information given that there are currently 50 unsold books.

Now, to find the total amount of money earned in the second year, we multiply the number of books sold in the second year by the price per book:
\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $900. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 900 \]"
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well, we need to add this bonus to his weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings with bonus} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \]

Since Watson earns weekly, we consider only full weeks in April. Therefore, we consider 4 full weeks in April.

\[ \text{Total earnings for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 800 \, \text{\$/week} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Since the company performed very well for the whole month, Watson also receives the $300 bonus for each of the 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total bonus for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 1200 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we add his total earnings from his hourly wage and the total bonus to find his total earnings for April.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 3200 \, \text{\$} + 1200 \, \text{\$} = 4400 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:

\[ \boxed{4400} \]"
"Sure, let me clarify this for you as Fatima would.

John arm wrestled 20 people. He beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he lost to, we first calculate 80% of 20, which is 16 people. This means he beat 16 people. Therefore, the number of people he lost to is 20 - 16, which equals 4.

So, the number of people John lost to is 4.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"Sure, let me walk you through this step-by-step again, keeping my persona in mind.

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

After the morning sales, the remaining loaves are:

\[
\text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"Given that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can deduce that Joey loses 2 pounds per week. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds. Therefore, to lose the same amount of weight (8 pounds) that Joey loses in 4 weeks, Sandy will need the same 4 weeks. 

So, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step to find the total savings.

For the ice cream:
- The original price of one tub is $13.
- The discounted price of one tub is $11.
- The savings on one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4.

For the milk:
- The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- Since the discount is the same for each packet, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- The savings on one packet of milk is $0.5.

Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2.

Adding the savings from the ice cream and the milk together:
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6.

So, the total amount saved by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $6."
"Sure, let me calculate this again from scratch as if it's the first time I'm looking at the problem.

To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to consider the growth rates:

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - We need to find out how many times 3 days fit into 15 days.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \)
   - Therefore, the person will grow 5 extra arms in 15 days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - We need to find out how many times 5 days fit into 15 days.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \)
   - Therefore, the person will grow 3 extra legs in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs.
   - Calculation: \( 5 + 3 = 8 \)

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"Sure, let's break down the expenses again to find out how much Theo can spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

First, we calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, we determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, we have:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Adding up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on other items (business suits, suitcases, flight ticket, and gifts) is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Subtracting the cost of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the total amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that feels more natural to me.

We have a family of 5 people. Three of them eat 3 eggs each day, and the other two eat 2 eggs each day. We need to find out how many eggs the family will consume in a week.

First, let's calculate the daily egg consumption:
- The three people who eat 3 eggs each day consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
- The two people who eat 2 eggs each day consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
- So, the total daily consumption is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption:
- Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly consumption is \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Therefore, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"Certainly! Let's break it down step by step with a clearer persona.

Given:
- Quinn is 30 years old.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

First, we calculate Jane's age:
\[
\text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
\]

Next, we calculate Trent's age:
\[
\text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
\]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"Certainly, let's break down the problem again with a fresh perspective.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Relate the population of Chile six years ago to Noah's age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).

5. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - So, \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

6. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Since the population of Chile six years ago was 120000, the current population is \(120000 \times 2 = 240000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{240000}\)."
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step to find out how many players are on the defense.

Given:
- Total number of players on the team: 105
- There are twice as many players on the offense as on the defense.
- There are half the number of players on the special teams as on the defense.

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

From the problem:
- Number of players on the offense = \( 2D \)
- Number of players on the special teams = \( \frac{D}{2} \)

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Martha initially invited:
- 2 families with 6 people each, which totals to \(2 \times 6 = 12\) people.
- 3 families with 4 people each, which totals to \(3 \times 4 = 12\) people.

So, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Eight people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, one-quarter of those 8 people had previous commitments, which means:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Subtracting the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited gives:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

Therefore, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is:
\[\boxed{14}\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find the total weight of the marbles Solomon has.

First, Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. His father then gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times the number of marbles he bought from Johanna. So, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

Adding the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna to the marbles his father gave him, we get:
\[
20 + 8 = 28
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is:
\[
28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ kg}
\]

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is \(\boxed{56}\) kg."
"To find the cost to fill the pool, I'll start by calculating the volume of the pool. The pool is 6 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. So, the volume \( V \) is:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Given that it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $12. 

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again with a fresh perspective.

Given:
- There are 30 boys in the classroom.
- The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys.
- The number of nongendered children is 1/10 of the number of boys.

First, calculate the number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
\]

Next, calculate the number of nongendered children:
\[
\text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
\]

Now, add up all the children to find the total:
\[
\text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
\]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and we know there are 45 electric wires, we can determine the number of electric poles by understanding that for every 3 wires, there is 1 pole. 

So, if 3 wires correspond to 1 pole, then 45 wires would correspond to:
\[ \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again with a clearer focus on the final number of women remaining at the party.

Initially, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 10 people left in total. This leaves 30 people at the party.

Given that 22 men stayed, it means \(25 - 22 = 3\) men left. Since the total number of people who left was 10, the number of women who left must be \(10 - 3 = 7\).

Therefore, the number of women remaining at the party is \(15 - 7 = 8\).

So, the final number of women left at the party is 8."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

The book costs $4. Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, we calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:
\[ \text{Cost of pen} = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 1 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jam has a total of 26 pencils, which includes 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils. This means each box contains \( \frac{26 - 2}{3} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \) pencils.

So, Jam has 3 boxes of 8 pencils each, which totals to 24 pencils, plus the 2 loose pencils, making 26 pencils in total.

Meg has 46 pencils.

To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils, we add the total number of pencils they have together:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.

First, we need to determine how many ice cubes are required to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we calculate:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Adding 15 milliliters of cream does not change the milliliters weaker calculation. The question is specifically asking about the reduction in milliliters due to the cooling, not the total volume of the drink.

Thus, the total reduction in milliliters due to the cooling is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Given that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record, and 5 people leave with 7 new records, we need to figure out how many old records they brought in initially.

Since 2 old records trade for 1 new record, to get 7 new records, we need:

\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step with a clearer persona.

Given:
- Total number of employees = 100
- Number of junior programmers = \(\frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\)
- Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60
- Monthly salary of a junior programmer = $2000
- Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Now, let's calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:
\[ 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Next, let's calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:
\[ 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Finally, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:
\[ 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"Certainly! Let's break it down step by step.

We start with \( x \) people at the terminal. At the first bus stop, 5 more people get on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people get off and 8 more get on. So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

According to the problem, after the second bus stop, there are 20 people on the bus. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again from the start with a fresh perspective:

1. Oscar begins with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He gives 14 lollipops to his friends, leaving him with \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops. Adding these to the remaining lollipops, he now has \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night, so he has \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning, leaving him with \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first calculate the percentage of charging required. The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which means it needs to charge an additional 40%.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

\[
\text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[
120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the time required to fully charge the phone is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start to ensure clarity.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip, earning 4 rewards ($1 off for every $20 spent). For this shopping trip, they spent $43 and used their rewards, which amounted to $4 off. Additionally, they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price, so the coupon discount was $8.

First, we subtract the rewards from the total spent:
\[
43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we apply the coupon discount:
\[
39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}

Therefore, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job Nick will make more money at, let's break down the calculations for both jobs.

For Job A:
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income: 10%
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's find the difference in net pay between the two jobs:
- Difference in net pay: $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job. The final answer is $8,400."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the final value of Maria's shares.

1. **Initial Purchase Value:**
   Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each.
   \[
   \text{Initial Value} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64
   \]

2. **First Year Price Increase:**
   The stock price increases by 50% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50\% \times \$8 = 0.50 \times \$8 = \$4
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]

3. **Value After First Year:**
   Maria now has 8 shares at the new price of $12 each.
   \[
   \text{Value After First Year} = 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We have a class of 200 students split into three groups. Two of these groups are equal in size, and the third group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two groups.

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group would be \( x - 10 \).

The total number of students can be represented by the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The smallest group, which has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, would have:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step as Fatima would.

Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's denote the number of cows as \( C \) and the number of chickens as \( H \). We know that:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, the number of cows is 20. Since there are twice as many chickens as cows, the number of chickens is:

\[ H = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160. 

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"Sure, let's break down the activities John did and calculate the time spent sightseeing step by step.

First, we calculate the time John spent on boating and swimming:
- Boating: 6 hours
- Swimming: Half of boating time, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours

Next, we calculate the time spent watching shows:
- Shows: 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours

Adding these up gives the total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent. To find the total time \( T \), we use the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

With the remaining $60, she can afford go-kart rides for her friends. Since each go-kart ride costs $10, the number of friends she can invite is:

\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of friends she can invite is 6."
"Sure, let me clarify this for you as Fatima would.

Marisa gets $5 every day as pocket money. Each day, she buys 4 lollipops, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. First, let's calculate the total cost of the lollipops she buys each day:

\[ 4 \times 25 \text{ cents} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

Since 100 cents is equal to $1, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day. Her daily pocket money is $5, so the amount she saves each day is:

\[ 5 \text{ dollars} - 1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

If she saves $4 each day, over 5 days, she would save:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the final amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again from the start to ensure clarity.

Billy starts with $10 and buys candy at a cost of $1.5 per pound. After buying the candy, he takes half of his remaining money and spends it on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. If he bought 40 gumballs, we need to find out how many pounds of candy he bought.

First, let's determine how much money Billy spends on gumballs. Since he buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost for the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This $2 is half of the change he takes after buying the candy. Therefore, the total change he has after buying the candy is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

This $4 is the remaining money after buying the candy. If he started with $10, the amount spent on candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, the number of pounds of candy he bought is:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Carver just turned 45 years old, and that makes him 5 years less than twice the age of his son. To find out how old his son is, we can set up the equation based on the information given:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"To find out how many days the train goes between services, we first calculate the total distance of one complete round trip. The trip from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, from the second city to the third city is 100 miles, and from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trips. The combined distance of the second and third city trips is \(100 + 75 = 175\) miles, so the distance from the third city back to the first city is \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles. Therefore, the total distance for one complete round trip is \(75 + 100 + 125 = 300\) miles.

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is \(300 \times 3 = 900\) miles. The train needs service every 18,000 miles, so the number of days it goes between services is \(\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20}\) days. Converting this into hours, \(\frac{1}{20}\) of a day is 12 hours.

Therefore, the train goes between services every 12 hours. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Rottweiler Bed Stuffing**: 8 pounds
2. **Chihuahua Bed Stuffing**: 2 pounds
3. **Collie Bed Stuffing**: The average of Rottweiler and Chihuahua beds, which is \((8 + 2) / 2 = 5\) pounds.

Now, we need to calculate the total stuffing for the beds Mark is making:
- **4 Chihuahua Beds**: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) pounds
- **3 Collie Beds**: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) pounds

Adding these together gives us the total stuffing needed:
\[8 + 15 = 23\] pounds

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is **23 pounds**."
"Sure, let's break down the trip time calculation again with a clearer focus.

First, John drives 200 miles to his friend's house at a speed of 70 mph. The time taken for this part is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Then, he takes a detour that adds 10 miles, making the total distance 210 miles. The time for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

On the way back, the distance is 240 miles at a speed of 80 mph. The time for this part is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these times together:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 96 fourth-graders at Small Tree School, and 43 of them are girls. This means the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls were absent, so the number of girls present is:

\[ 43 - 5 = 38 \]

Since the total number of fourth-graders is 96, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 96 - 38 = 58 - 4 = 54 \]

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

\[ 54 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 54 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down. If there are 6 girls in the park and the number of boys is twice that, then the number of boys is \(2 \times 6 = 12\). Adding the girls and boys together, we get \(6 + 12 = 18\). So, the total number of kids in the park is 18. 

The final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) be the score she needs on her third test. The equation representing the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer focus on the numbers provided.

We start with 3 customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks. So, \( x = 3 \).

Next, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of those for refusing masks minus 5. That means:
\[ 4x - 5 = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

Then, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of those for shoplifting. That means:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, adding up all the customers kicked out for these reasons:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

Since the total number of customers kicked out of the Walmart is 50, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is **19**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has a total of 24 points. This is because Sara scored 8 points, and Erin has three times more points than Sara. So, Erin's points after scoring 14 more are:

\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, to find out how many points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from her total points after scoring:

\[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of points Erin had before scoring the additional 14 points is 10.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we'll break down the expenses step by step:

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost, making it $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $24.
   - With 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment.

1. **Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment:**
   - Given that 40% of the total number of pieces are faulty, we can express this as \(0.4N\), where \(N\) is the total number of pieces of equipment.

2. **Calculate the number of functioning pieces of equipment:**
   - The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces.
   - Number of functioning pieces = \(N - 0.4N = 0.6N\).

3. **Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces:**
   - The total cost of the equipment is $400,000.
   - The cost of the functioning pieces is \(0.6\) times the total cost.
   - Total cost of functioning pieces = \(0.6 \times 400000\).

Now, let's perform the calculation:

\[
0.6 \times 400000 = 240000
\]

Thus, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

"Sure, let me clarify this for you in a way that feels more natural to me.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, provide 1 kg of milk each per day. The other half, also 15 sheep, provide 2 kg of milk each per day.

So, the total milk from the first half is:
\[ 15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg} \]

And the total milk from the second half is:
\[ 15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg} \]

Adding these together gives us the total milk collected per day:
\[ 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:

"Sure, let me clarify this for you as Fatima would.

Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so that's 6 rolls used. This leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. Each of these remaining rolls is broken into 8 pieces, so the total number of pieces given to the chickens is 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces.

Therefore, the number of pieces of rolls fed to the chickens is **48**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

1. We start with 40 pupils in total.
2. Half of the class likes blue, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ pupils like blue.}
   \]
3. After those who like blue, we have:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ pupils remaining.}
   \]
4. One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pupils like green.}
   \]
5. The rest of the pupils like yellow, which means:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15 \text{ pupils like yellow.}

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she got $56 from selling them at $4 per apple. To find out how many apples she sold, we divide the total money by the price per apple:

\[
\text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
\]

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which means:

\[
\text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

Now, to find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we add the apples picked on each day:

\[
\text{Total number of apples picked} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

\[ 20 \text{ (from pairs)} + 15 \text{ (loose)} = 35 \text{ socks} \]

Since she started with 50 socks, the number of socks she has missed is:

\[ 50 - 35 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of socks Lindsay has missed is:

\[
\boxed{15}

So, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 21."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we first calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest. The formula for the total amount is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Months}} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (r) = 10% = 0.10
- Number of Months (n) = 5

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5884.4115 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5884.4115}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.8823 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.88 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is **$1176.88**."
"Sure, let's calculate the distances again to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe.

First, we calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which means Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so she has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, to find the total number of silver pesos they have together, we add Axel's silver pesos to Anna's silver pesos:
\[50 + 100 = 150\]

Next, to find the total number of gold pesos they have together, we add Axel's gold pesos to Anna's gold pesos:
\[80 + 120 = 200\]

Finally, to find the total number of pesos they have together, we add the total silver pesos to the total gold pesos:
\[150 + 200 = 350\]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much profit Millie will make per hour.

First, we calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make. Since she can make 3 pitchers and each pitcher holds 12 cups, the total number of cups is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all 36 cups of lemonade at $1 per cup:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for Millie to sell all 36 cups. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the time required to sell all 36 cups is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The cost to make the lemonade is $18. To find the profit per hour, we need to determine the profit over the 9-hour period and then divide by 9:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

The profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2/\text{hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie will make per hour is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Certainly, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Mr. Ruther sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, which means he has \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land left. According to the problem, this remaining amount is 12.8 hectares. So, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To find the total amount of land \(x\), we need to solve for \(x\). We do this by isolating \(x\):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32
\]

So, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially is 32 hectares. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

The choir has 52 members in total. Since 50% are boys and 50% are girls, there are 26 girls in the choir. The choir decides to perform only with its female members, so we focus on the 26 girls.

On the day of the performance, half of the female members can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, half of 26 is:

\[
\frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

This means 13 girls can perform. Then, the 3 teachers decide to join them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step for clarity.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which includes 9 rides. This means he doesn't need to buy any additional tickets.

Dasha buys tickets to ride all 9 rides. Since each ride costs 2 tickets and each ticket costs $2, the cost per ride is $4. Therefore, for 9 rides, the total cost is $4 * 9 = $36.

The difference in cost between Dasha's and David's total costs is $36 - $30 = $6.

So, David saves $6.

The final numerical answer is:

"Certainly! Let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Monica is wrapping Christmas gifts. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. She has 144 inches of ribbon and wants to make a bow for each gift with it. How many inches of ribbon can she use for each gift bow?

First, let's find the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap:
- Gifts for her family: 6
- Gifts for her friends: 4
- Gifts for her teachers: 2

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica has a total of 12 gifts to wrap.

Next, we need to divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

"Sure, let's solve this step by step as Fatima would.

Given the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we need to find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty.

First, let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \( B \) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \( S \). The ratio \( B:S = 5:6 \) means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. This can be written as:

\[ \frac{B}{S} = \frac{5}{6} \]

From this, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( B \):

\[ S = \frac{6B}{5} \]

We also know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165:

\[ B + S = 165 \]

Substituting \( S = \frac{6B}{5} \) into the total popsicles equation:

\[ B + \frac{6B}{5} = 165 \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 5:

\[ 5B + 6B = 825 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 11B = 825 \]

Solve for \( B \):

\[ B = \frac{825}{11} = 75 \]

Now, substitute \( B = 75 \) back into the equation \( S = \frac{6B}{5} \):

\[ S = \frac{6 \times 75}{5} = \frac{450}{5} = 90 \]

So, Betty has 75 popsicles and Sam has 90 popsicles. To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty:

\[ S - B = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the savings calculation again in a clear manner.

Tim decides to cancel his $60 cable package and switch to streaming services. He gets Netflix for $10 a month, and Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he saves 20% on bundling these services.

First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the 20% savings:
- Normally, Hulu and Disney Plus cost $10 each, so together they cost $20.
- With a 20% discount, the savings are $20 * 0.20 = $4.
- Therefore, the cost after the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix:
- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- So, the total cost for streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26.

To find out how much money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package:
- The cable package cost $60 per month.
- The streaming services cost $26 per month.
- Therefore, the savings are $60 - $26 = $34.

So, Tim saves **$34** per month by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services."
"Sure, let's break down the time spent on each activity and calculate the percentage spent editing the song.

- Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
  \[
  4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent recording the song: half of the time spent writing it
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes

Total time spent on all activities:
\[
240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes}
\]

To find the percentage of the total work time spent editing:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{450 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
\]

So, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is **20%**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. First, we calculate the total number of slots in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of slots is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Next, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of these slots. So, we calculate double the number of slots and then add 20:
\[ 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92 \]

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many Valentine's cards Erica has now.

1. Erica initially made 20 cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of cards, with each box containing 15 cards. So, the total number of cards her dad brought is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
3. Adding the cards Erica made to the cards her dad brought, she has \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards in total.
4. Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
5. She also received 17 cards from family and friends.
6. To find out how many cards Erica has now, we subtract the cards she passed out and add the cards she received: \(50 - 24 + 17\).

Let's do the calculation:
\[50 - 24 = 26\]
\[26 + 17 = 43\]

So, Erica now has 43 Valentine's cards. 

The final answer is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Jenny starts with a pizza that has 12 slices. She gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. To find out how many slices that is, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. To find out how many slices that is, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 \text{ slices} + 3 \text{ slices} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, we add those to the slices given away:
\[ 7 \text{ slices} + 2 \text{ slices} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the total slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:
\[ 12 \text{ slices} - 9 \text{ slices} = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Mark currently has $50 in his bank account. He needs $300 to buy the bike, so he needs an additional $300 - $50 = $250. Since he earns $10 per day, the number of days he needs to work to earn $250 is $250 / $10 = 25 days.

Therefore, the number of days Mark has to save his money is 25 days."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is one-third the number of spiders, so:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

The number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer persona.

Given:
- Erica is 30 years old.
- Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth.

First, calculate Beth's age:
\[ \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \text{ years} \]

Next, calculate Alice's age:
\[ \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42 \text{ years} \]

Now, find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} = 42 - 30 = 12 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step as Fatima would.

Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. If flour is sold in 2-cup bags and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, we need to calculate how many of each Mark needs to buy.

For the flour:
- Normal recipe: 3 cups
- Quadruple batch: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cups
- Flour bags: \( \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags} \)

For the milk:
- Normal recipe: 1 cup
- Quadruple batch: \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups
- Milk bottles: \( \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles} \)

Now, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:
- Difference: \(6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \text{ bags}\)

Therefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the detailed calculation:

1. **Energy Consumption per Hour:**
   The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.

2. **Energy Consumption per Day:**
   Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day.
   \[
   \text{Energy per day} = 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours}
   \]

3. **Energy Consumption per Day After Reduction:**
   Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day.
   \[
   \text{New usage per day} = 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Energy per day after reduction} = 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours}
   \]

4. **Daily Energy Savings:**
   \[
   \text{Daily savings} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} - 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} = 4500 \, \text{watt-hours}
   \]

5. **Total Energy Savings Over 30 Days:**
   \[
   \text{Total savings} = 4500 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135000 \, \text{watt-hours}
   \]

6. **Convert Watt-hours to Kilowatt-hours:**
   \[
   1 \, \text{kilowatt-hour} = 1000 \, \text{watt-hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total savings in kilowatt-hours} = \frac{135000 \, \text{watt-hours}}{1000} = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours}
   \]

Therefore, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:

"Sure, let's calculate the average number of stripes on the zebras again with a clearer approach.

1. **Calculate the total number of stripes:**
   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
   - One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\)
   - One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\)

   Adding these together gives the total number of stripes:
   \[
   34 + 36 + 18 = 88
   \]

2. **Determine the number of zebras:**
   - There are 3 zebras in total.

3. **Calculate the average number of stripes:**
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of stripes}}{\text{Number of zebras}} = \frac{88}{3} \approx 29.33

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as if I'm Fatima.

Tyson needs to make muffaletta sandwiches for a big game. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and it serves 4 people. There are 20 people in total, so Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches to serve all of them. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound.

First, we need to determine how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much meat and cheese Tyson will need. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, for 5 sandwiches, he will need:
\[
\text{Total meat required} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total cheese required} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese:
\[
\text{Cost of meat} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding these costs together gives us the total amount Tyson will spend:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down again from the start with a fresh perspective.

1. **Initial number of cannolis:**
   Allan starts with 40 cannolis.

2. **Number of cannolis after buying more:**
   Allan buys 60 more cannolis.
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]

3. **Initial number of corns:**
   The problem states that there are twice as many corns as cannolis initially. Since there are 40 cannolis:
   \[
   \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

4. **Number of corns after buying fewer:**
   Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying more. Since he had 100 cannolis after buying more:
   \[
   \text{Number of corns after buying fewer} = 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]

5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis:**
   Now, we add the number of corns and cannolis Allan has:
   \[
   60 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 160
   \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, let's break down the information given:

- Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.
- He walked half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which means he walked 5,000 steps from school and home.
- He also walked an additional 1,000 steps with his friend, bringing the total to 6,000 steps.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal.

To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had already taken from his goal:

\[ 10,000 \text{ steps} - 6,000 \text{ steps} = 4,000 \text{ steps} \]

However, this calculation seems to have a discrepancy with the information that he had 2,000 steps left. Let's recheck:

- Steps from school and home: 5,000
- Additional steps with friend: 1,000
- Total steps before jog: 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000
- Steps left after jog: 2,000

So, the steps taken during the jog should be:

\[ 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 \]

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is 2,000. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{2000}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many minutes early Toby will be.

First, we calculate the total number of words in the book. The book is 45 pages long, and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we determine how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Therefore, the time it takes to read 9000 words is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. So, he needs to finish reading the book 50 minutes before he needs to leave the airport. Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

early.

Therefore, Toby will be \(\boxed{20}\) minutes early."
"Certainly! Let's break down the calculation again to ensure clarity.

In May, the company hired 40 employees, each working 40 hours a week at a rate of $15 per hour. The total hours worked by all employees in May is calculated as follows:

- Total hours worked in May: \(40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours}\)
- Total amount paid in May: \(6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars}\)

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, meaning 10 employees' contracts expired. Therefore, the number of employees remaining in June is \(40 - 10 = 30\).

For the remaining 30 employees, the total hours worked in June is:

- Total hours worked in June: \(30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours}\)
- Total amount paid in June: \(4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars}\)

Adding the amounts paid in May and June gives us the total amount paid by the company:

- Total amount paid in both months: \(96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{168000}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the costs again to ensure we get the right amount Sally has left.

First, the taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. For 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, the seashells cost $1.50 each, and Sally bought 4 seashells:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \]

The magnets cost $0.25 each, and Sally bought 4 magnets:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Adding these up gives the total cost:
\[ 4.50 + 6.00 + 1.00 = 11.50 \]

Sally's parents gave her $10. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost from the $10:
\[ 10.00 - 11.50 = -1.50 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Sally does not have enough money to cover the total cost. Therefore, she is short by $1.50.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-1.50}
\]"
"Sure, let's break down the costs step by step as if I'm Fatima.

Tim buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much, which is $800. So, the total cost of the two packs before any discount is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks to find the discounted price:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. To find the total amount spent, we add the discounted cost of the fireworks to the cost of the finale firework:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies a night, and she wants enough cookies to last for 30 days. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies, to find out how many dozens she needs to make 60 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a dozen:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days.

The correct answer is 5 dozens."

Given:
- 95% of the candles are safe and do not explode.
- 5% of the candles are dangerous and have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- 1% of the dangerous candles explode.

First, we calculate the number of dangerous candles:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we determine how many of these dangerous candles will explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.01 \times 2500 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.

First, we know Joanne gathers:
- 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Half of 30 apples from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples.
- Let's denote the number of apples she gathers from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

Her sister gathers:
- Twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- No apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Certainly, let's solve this step by step.

We have two pieces of information:
1. The total number of heads is 180.
2. The total number of humps is 304.

Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

From the first piece of information, we can write:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

From the second piece of information, we can write:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

To solve this system, we can use the method of elimination. First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we have \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the trip distances again to find the total.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, summing up all the distances:

\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

So, the total distance Tom made during his two-week-long trip is **3140 kilometers**."

"Sure, let me clarify this for you in a more personal way.

Mr. Josue received $4000 from the first bank and twice that amount from the second bank, which totals to $8000. Adding his initial capital of $5000 to the total amount he received from both banks, we get:

\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in capital. 

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and each carried away 5 cats, so a total of 20 cats were taken away. This leaves us with:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. So, the number of cats that ran away is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting these 18 cats from the 30 remaining cats gives us:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find out the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First 6 months:**
   - The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for 6 months = \(6 \times 8 = 48\) dollars.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8):**
   - The cost is $12 per month.
   - Total cost for 2 months = \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.

3. **Next 10 months (months 9 to 18):**
   - The cost is $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 10 months = \(10 \times 14 = 140\) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
48 + 24 + 140 = 212
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\boxed{212}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans.

First, we know the tattered jeans cost $28. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so:
\[ J = T - 6 \]
\[ J = 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \text{ from the jogger jeans} \]
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ dollars} \text{ from the tattered jeans} \]

The savings from the jogger jeans ($2) and the tattered jeans ($4) add up to the total savings of $6, which confirms our calculations.

The original cost of the jogger jeans was $22, and the tattered jeans cost $28. Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"Sure, let me refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

Lillian has built 3 bird feeders herself and bought 3 more from the store. Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds per day. The bird feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts 30 birds per day.

Now, we can calculate the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day:

- The 3 store-bought bird feeders attract \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds per day.
- The 3 bird feeders she made herself attract \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds per day.

Adding these together, the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day is \(60 + 90 = 150\).

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Aleksandra ordered a bagel, soup, and a piece of cake. The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, and the cake is half the price of the bagel.

First, let's calculate the cost of the soup:
- 25% of $4 is $1.
- So, the soup costs $4 + $1 = $5.

Next, let's find the cost of the cake:
- The cake is half the price of the bagel, so it costs $4 / 2 = $2.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
- Bagel: $4
- Soup: $5
- Cake: $2

Total cost = $4 + $5 + $2 = $11.

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) for her dinner."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many cards Kenny started with.

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards for $1.5 each and ends up with $50 after buying a ticket that costs $100. This means he had $50 initially from selling the cards.

If he sells \( \frac{2}{3} \) of his cards for $1.5 each and gets $50, we can set up the equation:
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) \times 1.5 = 50 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = \frac{2}{3}x \times \frac{3}{2} = x \]

So, we have:
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, Kenny started with 50 cards. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of guests who would have eaten two hotdogs if everyone had only eaten one:**
   - There are 36 guests, and half of them would have eaten two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).
   - So, 18 guests would have eaten two hotdogs each.

2. **Calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared:**
   - 18 guests would have eaten 2 hotdogs each, so \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - This means the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs.

3. **Determine the number of guests who actually wanted a second hotdog:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog.
   - Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, 4 hotdogs were left unprepared.

4. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - Out of the 40 guests, 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Indras has 6 letters in her name. To find out how many letters are in her sister's name, we first calculate half of the letters in Indras' name:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this number:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

So, Indras has 6 letters, and her sister has 7 letters. Adding these together gives us the total number of letters in both names:

\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13. 

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{13}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

Charlotte's initial total cost for the items is:
- Pot and pans: $120.00
- Mixing bowls: $20.00
- Utensils: 5 utensils at $5.00 each, so $5.00 * 5 = $25.00

Adding these together gives:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

The items are 20% off, so the discount amount is:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final amount Charlotte has to pay is:
\[ 132.00 \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"

Dora needs to buy a skipping rope that costs $6, a board game that costs $11, and a playground ball that costs $2. The total cost of these items is:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Dora has saved $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. So, the total amount of money Dora has is:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs \(\boxed{1}\) more dollar to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

   \]
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many as Prince Arthur, so:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many as Prince Walter, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that feels more natural to me.

First, we have 15 gallons of gas divided equally into 5 containers. So, each container holds:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container. Since each container is 3 gallons, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, to convert gallons to pints, and knowing that 1 gallon equals 8 pints, we get:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step, considering the refined persona of Fatima.

1. **Total amount spent by George:** $5.
2. **Amount left after purchase:** 1% of $5, which is $0.05.
3. **Amount spent on chips:** $5 - $0.05 = $4.95.
4. **Cost of one bag of chips:** $0.40.
5. **Number of bags of chips bought:** $4.95 / $0.40 = 12.375. Since George can only buy whole bags, he bought 12 bags of chips.
6. **Total cost of chips:** 12 bags * $0.40 = $4.80.
7. **Amount left after buying chips:** $5 - $4.80 = $0.20.
8. **Cost of one candy bar:** $0.75.
9. **Number of candy bars bought:** $0.20 / $0.75 = 0.2667. Since George can only buy whole candy bars, he bought 0 candy bars.

However, the problem states that George bought 3 bags of chips, which means the cost of chips must be rechecked. If George bought 3 bags of chips, the cost is:
3 bags * $0.40 = $1.20.
So, the remaining money is:
$5 - $1.20 = $3.80.
The cost of candy bars is:
$3.80 - $0.05 = $3.75.
The number of candy bars he bought is:
$3.75 / $0.75 = 5.

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:

So, each person will get 7 oranges. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

First, Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, and he doubles that amount. So, he needs:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, each costing $2.00, so the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives us the total cost:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is:

\[ \$2.00 \]

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to consider the total time she needs to be at the theater, which is 4 minutes (her drive time) plus 5 minutes (arriving 5 minutes early), totaling 9 minutes.

Since the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel, the drive time for Bernadette is 4 minutes (Wayne's drive time) multiplied by 4, which equals 16 minutes.

To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time Wayne takes to drive to the theater from the total time Bernadette needs to be at the theater:

\[
\text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = 9 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start with the given area and length. The area is 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards, which converts to 9 feet. Using the area formula for a rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:

\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet. The correct answer is:

"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the step-by-step calculation again:

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.
2. **Temperature Increase from Oven**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
   - Total temperature increase from the oven = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.
3. **Temperature Decrease from Window**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Time the window is open = 30 minutes.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.
   - Total temperature decrease from the window = 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.
   - Final temperature after the window is closed = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

So, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long it took James to do the run.

First, we convert Jon's times into minutes:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

So, the total time Jon took is:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Therefore, the time James takes for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Therefore, the time James takes for the bike is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( R \) be the time James takes for the run. The total time James took is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \text{ minutes} \]

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the total time James took equal to 180 minutes, we get:
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Movie C is given as 1.25 hours, which is 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is \(75 + 5 = 80\) minutes long.

Therefore, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

First, we need to find out how far Michael's horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).

1. **Convert 30 minutes to hours:**
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how much hay the horse consumes for running 16 miles.

3. **Calculate the amount of hay consumed:**
   \[
   \text{Hay consumed per mile} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails}
   \]

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per bail} = \$3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times \$3 \text{ per bail} = \$24

Finally, we need to determine the change Michael has after buying the hay.

5. **Calculate the change:**
   \[
   \text{Money Michael has} = 6 \times 5 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find the profit.

First, we calculate the cost price per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[
\text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each on Monday:

\[
\text{Revenue from Monday sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we determine how many sneakers were sold to the department store. Since 17 sneakers were sold at $20 each, the remaining sneakers are:

\[
48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
\]

The department store sold these 31 sneakers at $25 each, so the revenue from the department store is:

\[
\text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the revenue from both sales to find the total revenue:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. The total cost is the cost price of all 48 sneakers, which is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[
\text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

The cost of the super ticket is $20, which includes a popcorn and a soda for an extra $1. So, the total cost for the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and soda separately:
\[ 21 = 15 + P - 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 21 = 13 + P \]
\[ P = 21 - 13 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

So, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{8} \]"

   - Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
     \[
     \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - The cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - First, break down the multiplication:
     \[
     170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
     \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     \[
     170 \times 60 = 10200
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 5 = 850
     \]
   - Add the results:
     \[
     10200 + 850 = 11050
     \]

Therefore, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is $11050."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate the distance for each part of the trip:

1. For the first part, the car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours. So, the distance is:
   \[
   60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second part, the car travels at 30 mph for 1 hour. So, the distance is:
   \[
   30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Next, we add these distances to find the total distance:
\[
120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Now, we calculate the total time taken:
\[
2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is \( 50 \, \text{mph} \)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 of them for 2 rubies. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, the rubies she gets are worth the same amount, which is $2400. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the 2 rubies are worth:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Jenna has 5 sapphires left (since she traded 3 out of her 8). The value of these 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the value of the sapphires and the rubies together gives us the total value of all her jewels:

\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

\[
\boxed{6400}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that feels more natural to me.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. To find out how many apples they eat together in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. First, calculate how many apples Marin eats in 30 days: \(4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}\).
2. Similarly, Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, so in 30 days, she eats \(4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples}\).
3. Now, to find the total number of apples they both eat together, we add Marin's and Nancy's apples: \(120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples}\).

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To find out how much potting soil Bob needs, we first calculate the volume of one raised bed. Each raised bed is 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of potting soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

We start with 15 red cards. The number of green cards is 60% more than the red cards. So, we calculate the green cards as follows:
\[
\text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24
\]

Next, the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards:
\[
\text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39
\]

Now, we add up all the cards:
\[
\text{Total number of cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78
\]

So, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is 78. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{78}

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After 20 minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is 25 fairies, joining the original 50. So, the total number of fairies becomes:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Then, 10 minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is:

\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the final number of fairies remaining is 45.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of puppies**: Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is \(8 + 12 = 20\).

2. **Total number of puppies with spots**: Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies, and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies. Therefore, the total number of spotted puppies is \(3 + 4 = 7\).

3. **Percentage of puppies with spots**: To find the percentage, we use the formula \(\left(\frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}}\right) \times 100\). Plugging in the numbers, we get \(\left(\frac{7}{20}\right) \times 100 = 35\%\).

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is \(35\%\).

The correct answer is \(\boxed{35}\)."
"To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, let's break down the weights of each type of feed:

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight of hay = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight of oats = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

Now, let's sum the weights of all the feed items to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips required, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

Therefore, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month.

First, we calculate her weekly earnings from aluminum cans:
- Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans a week.

So, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are:
\[ 3 \text{ cans/week} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents/week} \]

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings from plastic bottles:
- Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles a week.

So, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are:
\[ 5 \text{ bottles/week} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents/week} \]

Now, we add these two amounts to find her total weekly earnings:
\[ 6 \text{ cents/week} + 15 \text{ cents/week} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \]

To find her total earnings for a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
\[ 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."

Miss Maria has six decks of basketball cards, with each deck containing 25 cards. So, the total number of basketball cards is:

\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

She also has five boxes of baseball cards, with each box containing 40 cards. Therefore, the total number of baseball cards is:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of cards Miss Maria has:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 \text{ total cards} - 50 \text{ cards kept} = 300 \text{ cards given to students} \]

If her students each receive 10 cards, the number of students she has is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Becky:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- So, the cost before the discount is \(20 \times 0.45 = 9\) dollars.
- Becky received a $1 discount.
- Therefore, the final cost for Becky is \(9 - 1 = 8\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- So, the cost before the discount is \(20 \times 0.50 = 10\) dollars.
- Kelly received a 10 percent discount, which is \(10 \times 0.10 = 1\) dollar.
- Therefore, the final cost for Kelly is \(10 - 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
- Kelly paid 9 dollars, and Becky paid 8 dollars.
- The difference is \(9 - 8 = 1\) dollar.

So, Kelly paid 1 dollar more than Becky. The final answer is:

2. Each room has 1 comforter.
3. Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so that's \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's add up the total number of pieces of laundry per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

So, the total number of pieces of laundry per room is \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\).

Since there are 80 rooms, the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms is:

On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes.

Adding these gains to his initial number of shoes:
\[200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300\]

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes:
\[300 - 180 = 120\]

Therefore, the number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is:

   - Total pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Pencils Used After Two Months:**
   - After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 pencils = 60 pencils.

3. **Remaining Pencils After Two Months:**
   - Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
   - Remaining pencils = 300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils.

4. **Pencils Left at the End of the Year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * Remaining pencils
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 pencils = 80 pencils.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we need to convert the shark's length from feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, a 10-foot shark is:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find what percentage of the shark's body length (120 inches) the combined length of the remoras (12 inches) represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. The correct answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything.

First, we know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To find the total number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion:

\[ \text{Allergic to either or both} = \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both} \]
\[ = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is **20**."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem again to find the total number of people going on the tour.

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is 621."
"Sure, let's break down the costs step by step as if I'm Fatima.

First, the cost of the plane tickets for Tom and his wife is:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, the hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price of $1500 per day. So, the cost per day at the hotel is:
\[ 1500 + (0.20 \times 1500) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Adding the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel gives us the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so:

\[
\text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times 20 = 60
\]

Each player can store up to 100 songs. So, the number of additional songs each can add is:

\[
\text{Gabriel can add} = 100 - 20 = 80
\]
\[
\text{Luri can add} = 100 - 60 = 40
\]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:

\[

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as if I'm Fatima.

James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. If he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we need to find out how many hours he runs in a week.

First, calculate the total miles he runs in a week:
\[ 12 \, \text{miles/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 60 \, \text{miles/week} \]

Next, to find out how many hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles by his speed:
\[ \frac{60 \, \text{miles}}{10 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 6 \, \text{hours/week} \]

So, the number of hours James runs a week is 6 hours. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as if I'm Fatima.

First, we need to find out how much oats one horse consumes in a day. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal, and they are fed twice a day. So, the total oats consumed by one horse per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total oats consumed by all four horses in a day:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much oats all four horses consume in five days:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we determine how many bags of oats are needed. Each bag contains 50 pounds of oats:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

So, Uncle Ben needs \(\boxed{4}\) bags of oats to feed his horses for five days."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00.
   - Heather buys 2 packs, so the total cost before any discounts is \(2 \times 4.00 = 8.00\) dollars.

2. **Applying the Buy One Get One Free Offer:**
   - With the offer, for every pack she buys, she gets another pack for free.
   - So, for 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack.
   - The total cost after the offer is \(1 \times 4.00 = 4.00\) dollars.

3. **Applying the $2.00 Coupon:**
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   - The total cost after applying the coupon is \(4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

4. **Calculating the Cost per Individual Razor:**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors.
   - So, 2 packs contain \(2 \times 4 = 8\) razors.
   - The cost per individual razor is \(\frac{2.00}{8} = 0.25\) dollars.

5. **Converting to Cents:**
   - 1 dollar = 100 cents.
   - Therefore, the cost per individual razor in cents is \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\) cents.

So, the cost per individual razor after all discounts is \(\boxed{25}\) cents."

"Sure, let's break it down again from the start to ensure clarity.

Charisma works for 8 hours every day. She gets up and walks for 5 minutes every hour she's at work. We need to find out how many minutes she has walked after 5 days.

1. **Determine the number of hours Charisma works each day:**
   Charisma works for 8 hours every day.

2. **Calculate the number of times she gets up and walks each day:**
   Since she works for 8 hours each day, she gets up and walks 8 times a day.

3. **Determine the duration of each walk:**
   Each walk lasts 5 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total number of minutes walked each day:**
   Since she walks 8 times a day and each walk is 5 minutes long, the total number of minutes walked each day is:
   \[
   8 \text{ walks/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/walk} = 40 \text{ minutes/day}

"Certainly! Let's break it down step by step to find Angela's current age.

Brett is currently 14 years old. According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, we can calculate Brett's age in four years as follows:

\[ \text{Brett's age in four years} = 14 + 4 = 18 \]

The problem states that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Angela's age in four years} = 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

To find Angela's current age, we subtract four years from her age in four years:

\[ \text{Angela's current age} = 42 - 4 = 38 \]

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Sure, let me calculate this again from scratch as if it's the first time.

Paul drives his car twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon. He does this for 14 days. Each morning ride costs him $6, and each afternoon ride costs him $2.

First, let's calculate the total number of morning rides:
- He drives twice a day, so in 14 days, he drives \(2 \times 14 = 28\) times in the morning.

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of afternoon rides:
- Similarly, he drives twice a day, so in 14 days, he drives \(2 \times 14 = 28\) times in the afternoon.

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides:
\[ 168 + 56 = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{224} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer persona.

Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so that's:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Adding the oranges together:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie needs three oranges, so the number of pies they can make is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the final number of greek orange pies they can make is:

\[ 40 \]

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Certainly, let's solve this step by step.

For the first venue, the cost is a flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food. So, the total cost for the first venue is \(200 + 5n\).

For the second venue, the cost is $25 per guest, and food is included in the price, so the total cost for the second venue is \(25n\).

To find the number of guests \(n\) for which the costs are equal, we set up the equation:
\[200 + 5n = 25n\]

Now, let's solve for \(n\):
\[200 + 5n = 25n\]
Subtract \(5n\) from both sides:
\[200 = 20n\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[n = 10\]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \(10\).

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer approach.

We know that together Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects. Let's denote the number of insects David found as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects collected is given by the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, we calculate the number of insects Lily found as:

\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"

Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. She got two packs of strawberry gum, one pack of grape gum for $2, and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1. The total cost of the gum is $7.

Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). The equation representing the total cost is:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

Frederick wants to maximize the number of popsicle sticks he can make with his $24. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has $24 to buy wood for sticks. A 2 x 4 costs $4, and a 2 x 8 costs $6.

First, let's see how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy:
\[
\text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]
Each 2 x 4 piece gives him 200 sticks, so:
\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy:
\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]
Each 2 x 8 piece gives him 400 sticks, so:
\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 8 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Since 1600 sticks from 2 x 8 pieces is more than 1200 sticks from 2 x 4 pieces, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 pieces to maximize the number of sticks. Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is:

\[
\boxed{1600}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought, and Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can deduce the quantities Sophia bought.

First, let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

So, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. 

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pounds Andy needs to lose:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.

2. **Determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn:**
   Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of days Andy has until his goal:**
   Andy's goal is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the days from December 31st to July 19th.

   - **December:** 31 - 31 = 0 days (since December 31st is the last day of December)
   - **January:** 31 days
   - **February:** 28 days (2023 is not a leap year)
   - **March:** 31 days
   - **April:** 30 days
   - **May:** 31 days
   - **June:** 30 days
   - **July:** 19 days (up to July 19th)

   Adding these days together:
   \[
   0 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 180 \text{ days}

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Given that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000 and the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can set up the following equations:

Let \( L \) be the cost of the lot. Then the cost of the house \( H \) is \( 3L \).

So, we have:
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now, substituting \( L \) back into the equation for the house:
\[ H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we first find double the time Rob takes:
\[ 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add the additional 40 minutes:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 280 \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many skeins of wool Martha will need.

1. **Hats**: Each grandchild needs 1 hat, and she needs 3 hats in total. Each hat requires 2 skeins of wool. So, for 3 hats, she needs \(3 \times 2 = 6\) skeins of wool.

2. **Scarves**: Each grandchild needs 1 scarf, and she needs 3 scarves in total. Each scarf requires 4 skeins of wool. So, for 3 scarves, she needs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) skeins of wool.

3. **Sweaters**: Each grandchild needs 1 sweater, and she needs 3 sweaters in total. Each sweater requires 12 skeins of wool. So, for 3 sweaters, she needs \(3 \times 12 = 36\) skeins of wool.

4. **Mittens**: Each grandchild needs 1 pair of mittens, and she needs 3 pairs of mittens in total. Each pair of mittens requires 1 skein of wool. So, for 3 pairs of mittens, she needs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) skeins of wool.

5. **Socks**: Each grandchild needs 1 pair of socks, and she needs 3 pairs of socks in total. Each pair of socks requires 2 skeins of wool. So, for 3 pairs of socks, she needs \(3 \times 2 = 6\) skeins of wool.

Now, let's add up all the skeins of wool required:
\[ 6 \text{ (hats)} + 12 \text{ (scarves)} + 36 \text{ (sweaters)} + 3 \text{ (mittens)} + 6 \text{ (socks)} = 63 \text{ skeins of wool} \]

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

1. **Tony** can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. **Bobby** picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy** can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky** picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29

"Certainly, let's break it down step by step to find out how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

1. **Determine the painting rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, in one day, one person can paint \(\frac{1}{2} \div 5 = \frac{1}{10}\) of a house.

2. **Determine the combined painting rate of 5 people:**
   - If one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day, then 5 people can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}\) of a house in one day.

3. **Determine the time required for 5 people to paint a whole house:**
   - Since 5 people can paint \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a house in one day, they will need \(2\) days to paint a whole house.

4. **Convert the time from days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, 2 days is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer persona.

Given:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas.
- Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so if \( S_O \) is the number of sofas, then \( C_O = S_O + 2 \). Since \( S_O = 20 \), we find \( C_O = 20 + 2 = 22 \).
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
- Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so if \( S_J \) is the number of sofas, then \( S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, to find the total number of sofas and chairs:
- Total sofas = \( S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \).
- Total chairs = \( C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \).
- Total number of sofas and chairs = \( 84 + 88 = 172 \).

So, the total number of sofas and chairs they have together is 172. 

The correct answer is:

     \]

3. **Determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought without the headphone set:**
   - Without the headphone set, Tom would have $48.
   - The number of CDs he could buy with $48 is:
     \[
     \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ CDs}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
     \[
     12 - 11 = 1 \text{ CD}
     \]

So, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy \(\boxed{1}\) more CD."

"Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 passengers get off the bus.
- The number of passengers who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 passengers get off the bus.
- The number of passengers who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) passengers.

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

Therefore, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

To solve the problem, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \(27 - 5 = 22\) years.

2. **Determine his cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - Therefore, his cousin's age in 8 years will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) years.

3. **Determine his cousin's current age:**
   - If his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then his cousin's current age is \(55 - 8 = 47\) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Given:
- The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer is $2,400.
- The computer costs $1,100.
- The printer costs $400 less than the computer.

First, we calculate the cost of the printer:
\[ \text{Cost of Printer} = \text{Cost of Computer} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost equation:
\[ \text{Cost of Computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of Monitor} + \text{Cost of Printer} = 2400 \]
Substitute the known values:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300.

The final numerical answer is:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - The number of boys and girls is equal.
   - Therefore, the number of boys and girls is:
     \[
     \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys:**
   - Each boy brought 60 seashells.
   - The total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
     \[
     10 \times 60 = 600
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of seashells brought by the girls:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - The number of seashells brought by the boys is 60.
   - Four times the number of seashells brought by the boys is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April.

Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. He wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. April has 30 days, so the first half consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

The total savings in the first half of April would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings in the second half of April would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings would be the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

Given that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $25 each day in the first half of April. Consequently, in the second half of April, he needs to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

First, we calculate the cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, we calculate the cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, we calculate the cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the change Verna received is $7.00.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

If Jeff and Brad together have 100 dollars, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we can set up the equation as follows:

Let \( B \) be the amount of money Brad gets. Then, Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total amount is:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:
\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Elise is learning to write and decides to keep re-writing the alphabet until she knows it. She writes it in full twice, writes half of it once, then re-writes everything she has already written. How many letters has Elise written in total?

1. The alphabet has 26 letters.
2. Writing the alphabet twice means she writes \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.
3. Writing half of the alphabet once means she writes \(26 \div 2 = 13\) letters.
4. Adding the letters from the first two steps, she has written \(52 + 13 = 65\) letters.
5. Re-writing everything she has already written means she writes \(65 \times 1 = 65\) letters again.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(65 + 65 = 130\).

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(\boxed{130}\)."

"Sure, let's break down the calculation again to ensure clarity.

Daniel wants to buy:
- Five notebooks at $1.50 each.
- Two pens at $0.25 each.
- One calculator at $12.
- One geometry set at $10.

First, we calculate the total cost for each type of item:
- Total cost for notebooks: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Total cost for pens: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- Total cost for the calculator: \(1 \times 12 = 12\)
- Total cost for the geometry set: \(1 \times 10 = 10\)

Next, we sum these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all items. To find the discount amount:
\[10\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.10 \times 20 = 2\]

Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Daniel has to spend:
\[20 - 2 = 18\]

Therefore, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars on all the items he wants to buy."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

First, the cost of the hamburgers:
\[ 5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$4 \text{ per hamburger} = \$20 \]

Next, the cost of the potato fries:
\[ 10 \text{ packs of potato fries} \times \$0.30 \text{ per pack} = \$3 \]

Then, the cost of the fruit drinks:
\[ 5 \text{ cans of fruit drinks} \times \$2 \text{ per can} = \$10 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ \$20 + \$3 + \$10 = \$33 \]

Since Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, the change she gets back is:
\[ \$50 - \$33 = \$17 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Certainly! If Antonella sold goods worth $2500 under a commission-based salary system where the first $1000 earns a 30% commission and any amount over $1000 earns an additional 10%, we can calculate her earnings as follows:

1. **Commission for the first $1000:**
   - Commission rate: 30%
   - Amount: $1000
   - Commission earned: \( 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \)

2. **Commission for the amount over $1000:**
   - Commission rate: 10%
   - Amount over $1000: $2500 - $1000 = $1500
   - Commission earned: \( 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \)

3. **Total commission earned:**
   - Total commission: \( 300 + 150 = 450 \)

Therefore, Antonella earned a total of $450.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{450}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Bill starts with 2 cases of water, and each case contains 24 bottles. So, the total number of bottles he has initially is:
\[ 2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles/case} = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

He has 70 guests coming, and he wants to give each guest 2 bottles of water. Therefore, the total number of bottles needed is:
\[ 70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles/guest} = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many more bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:
\[ 140 \text{ bottles} - 48 \text{ bottles} = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the number of additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day.

1. **Time to swim a mile in cold water:**
   - Given: 16 minutes.

2. **Time to swim a mile in warm water:**
   - The problem states that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water.
   - Twice the time in cold water: \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - Adding 2 minutes: \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

3. **Time to swim 3 miles in cold water:**
   - Time for 1 mile: 16 minutes.
   - Time for 3 miles: \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.

4. **Time to swim 3 miles in warm water:**
   - Time for 1 mile: 34 minutes.
   - Time for 3 miles: \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

5. **Difference in time to swim 3 miles between warm and cold water:**
   - Time in warm water: 102 minutes.
   - Time in cold water: 48 minutes.
   - Difference: \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{54}

"To find out how many weeks it will take John to save $80, I'll start by calculating his weekly earnings. He earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:

\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, I divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

We start with a bag of 21 buttons. Out of these, 7 buttons have two holes each. The rest of the buttons, which is 21 - 7 = 14 buttons, have four holes each.

To find the total number of holes, we calculate as follows:
- The total number of holes from the 7 buttons with two holes is 7 * 2 = 14 holes.
- The total number of holes from the 14 buttons with four holes is 14 * 4 = 56 holes.

Adding these together, the total number of holes in all the buttons is 14 + 56 = 70 holes.

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, so:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"Given the context and the assumption that the daily recommended cups of coffee \( R \) is 8, we can calculate the reduction in Juan's coffee intake as follows:

Octavia drinks half of the daily recommended cups, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times 4 = 40 \) cups.

According to his doctor, Juan should reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, the reduction in Juan's coffee intake is \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) cups.

So, the number of cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

We have 6 cages in total. Three of these cages contain 10 hamsters each, and the other three cages contain 5 guinea pigs each.

First, let's calculate the total number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, let's calculate the total number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

So, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents. 

The final answer is 45."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again with a fresh perspective.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.

Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark:
\[ \text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan:
\[ \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob:
\[ \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight of the three friends, we divide the total weight by 3:
\[ \text{Average weight} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step from my perspective.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun from the Ground:**
   - The great pyramids are positioned at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when viewed from the entrance of Sahir's house.
   - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is directly above the entrance.

2. **Sun's Movement:**
   - The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees upward from the pyramid per hour.
   - Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}\) upward.

3. **Final Angle Calculation:**
   - Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground.
   - After 10 hours, the sun will be 50 degrees above the tip of the pyramid.
   - Therefore, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be the sum of the initial angle and the angle the sun has moved upward:
     \[
     32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
     \]

Thus, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{82}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

James has two sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, making the other son 8 years old. So, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

Each pack contains 5 candles, so James needs 20 / 5 = 4 packs of candles.

Since each pack costs $3, the total amount James spends is 4 packs * $3/pack = $12.

Therefore, the amount James spends on candles is $12.

The final numerical answer is **$12**."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem again to find out how many pages Judy read in two weeks.

### Step 1: Calculate the total reading time in the first week
Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 days in the first week.
\[
15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the reading time in the first week to pages
We know that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[
\frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute}
\]

Now, we convert the 105 minutes of reading time in the first week to pages:
\[
105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 3: Add the reading time in the second week
In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

### Step 4: Calculate the total reading time in two weeks
\[
140 \text{ pages (first week)} + 100 \text{ pages (second week)} = 240 \text{ pages}
\]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:

4. **Total sandwiches eaten**: Cody and Trevor together ate \(4 + 3 = 7\) sandwiches.
5. **Sandwiches left**: Subtract the total eaten from the total number of sandwiches, which is \(12 - 7 = 5\) sandwiches.

So, the number of sandwiches left is 5."
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step to find out how old Shiloh's nephew is today.

Shiloh is currently 44 years old. In 7 years, Shiloh will be:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \]

In 7 years, his nephew will be:
\[ x + 7 \]

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the current age of Shiloh's nephew is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again to ensure clarity.

1. For the first tooth, the tooth fairy left $5.00.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 for each tooth, so that's $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of $1.00 per tooth, which is $0.50 per tooth. So, for two teeth, that's $1.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

Total: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many goals all three teenagers scored.

1. We know that Richie scored 80 goals.
2. Since Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, we can find Anna's goals by subtracting 45 from Richie's goals:
   \[
   \text{Anna's goals} = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]
3. We also know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Therefore, we can find Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals:
   \[
   \text{Mark's goals} = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

Now, to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add their individual goals together:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Richie's goals} + \text{Mark's goals} + \text{Anna's goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175.

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Sure, let me refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the detailed breakdown:

Peter starts with $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. That means he spends $10 each day. 

From Sunday through Wednesday, he buys wooden action figures at $5 each. Over these 4 days, he spends $20 on wooden action figures. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he buys \( \frac{20}{5} = 4 \) wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday), he buys plastic action figures at $2 each. Over these 4 days, he spends $8 on plastic action figures. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, he buys \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) plastic action figures.

Adding the total number of action figures, he has \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) action figures by the end of the week.

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is **8**."

"Sure, let me refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- The first shop: 20 roses
- The second shop: 15 roses
- The third shop: 30 roses

So, the total number of roses ordered by the shops per week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Ford needs to supply 65 roses per week, but he only grows 40 roses per week. Therefore, the number of roses he lacks per week is:
\[ 65 - 40 = 25 \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses he lacks per month is:
\[ 25 \times 4 = 100 \]

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 100 \]"
"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account. She removes $100 every month. To find out how much money will be remaining in her account after 2 years, we first calculate the total number of months in 2 years, which is 24 months. Over these 24 months, she will remove $100 each month, totaling $2400. Subtracting this amount from her initial savings gives us the remaining amount. 

So, the calculation is:

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in her account after 2 years is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To find the net profit, let's break down the costs and revenues step by step.

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - Each loaf of bread costs $3.00 and makes 10 sandwiches.
   - For 10 sandwiches, they need 1 loaf of bread.
   - Total cost of bread = $3.00.

2. **Cost of Cheese and Condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - Total cost of cheese and condiments = $30.00.

3. **Total Cost per Sandwich:**
   - Total cost for 10 sandwiches = $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.
   - Cost per sandwich = $33.00 / 10 = $3.30.

4. **Revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - Total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00.

5. **Net Profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost.
   - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

Therefore, the net profit is $37.00."

"Sure, let's break down the costs step by step as if I'm Fatima.

First, we calculate the area of Michael's bedroom:

\[ \text{Area} = 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding:

\[ \text{Cost of new carpet} = 12 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 2592 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Cost of padding} = 2 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 432 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Total cost of new carpet and padding} = 2592 \text{ dollars} + 432 \text{ dollars} = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:

\[ \text{Cost of removing old carpet} = 4 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:

\[ \text{Cost of installing new carpet} = 34 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 7344 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding all these costs together:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 3024 \text{ dollars} + 864 \text{ dollars} + 7344 \text{ dollars} = 11232 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

The final numerical answer is 7."
"To solve this, I first calculated the percentage error when the oven is set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The error is 18 degrees, and the percentage error is 4%. This means the oven is off by 4% from the set temperature.

Now, to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees, I need to account for the 4% error. If the actual temperature should be 520 degrees, the set temperature \( x \) should satisfy the equation:
\[ 0.96x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{0.96} \]
\[ x = 541.67 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to approximately 541.67 degrees to achieve the desired 520 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 541.67 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for clarity.

First, the duration of the first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes. Converting this to minutes:
- 1 hour is 60 minutes.
- Adding 30 minutes, the first movie is \(60 + 30 = 90\) minutes long.

Next, the second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
- 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
- Adding 5 minutes, the second movie is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes long.

Now, to find the total time for both movies, we add the durations:
- The first movie is 90 minutes.
- The second movie is 125 minutes.
- Adding these together, \(90 + 125 = 215\) minutes.

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"Certainly! Let's break it down step by step to find the value of Juan's house and then the combined value of both houses.

First, we know that Herb's house is worth $76,000. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we calculate 30% of $76,000:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Subtracting this amount from Herb's house price gives us the value of Juan's house:

\[ \text{Value of Juan's house} = 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of both houses, we add the value of Herb's house to the value of Juan's house:

\[ \text{Combined value} = 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is \(\boxed{129200}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy's friend brought cups, which means the friend brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.

Now, to find the total number of utensils brought by both, we add the cups and dishes together:

- Total cups: 12 (Judy's) + 40 (friend's) = 52 cups
- Total dishes: 24 (Judy's) + 60 (friend's) = 84 dishes

Adding these together gives us the total number of utensils:
\[ 52 \text{ cups} + 84 \text{ dishes} = 136 \text{ utensils} \]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 136. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{136} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we have the original price of one box of contacts at $100.00. With a 10% discount, the price of one box becomes:
\[ 100.00 - (100.00 \times 0.10) = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

So, one box of contacts costs $90.00 after the discount.

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts, so 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

Assuming Pete uses one pair of contacts per day, 180 contacts will last for:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ contacts}}{2 \text{ contacts per pair}} = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate the total hours Jill worked:
- Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday.
- Total hours Jill worked = 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the total hours John worked:
- John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.
- Total hours John worked = 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, we calculate the earnings for both Jill and John:
- Earnings for Jill = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30.
- Earnings for John = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:
- Difference in earnings = Earnings of John - Earnings of Jill = $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The final answer is $40."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate the total calories burned during Hannah's workout:

1. **Aerobics:**
   - Duration: 2 hours
   - Calories burned per hour: 500 calories
   - Total calories burned during aerobics: \(2 \times 500 = 1000\) calories

2. **Running:**
   - Duration: 1 hour
   - Calories burned per hour: 600 calories
   - Total calories burned during running: \(1 \times 600 = 600\) calories

3. **Total calories burned:**
   - Total calories burned during aerobics and running: \(1000 + 600 = 1600\) calories

Next, we determine how much water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories burned. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

4. **Water consumption calculation:**
   - Water needed per 200 calories: 100 ml
   - Total water needed for 1600 calories: \(\frac{1600}{200} \times 100 = 8 \times 100 = 800\) ml

Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 800 ml.

The final answer is \(\boxed{800}\) ml."
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step.

Given that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, and the relationships between the numbers of red, blue, and green jelly beans are as described, we can set up the equations accordingly.

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). Then, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is \( 0.99B \) and the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of green jelly beans is 30 more than the number of red jelly beans. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Sure, let's calculate the average of the three typing speeds step by step.

1. The initial speed is 47 WPM.
2. After the first increase, the speed is 52 WPM.
3. After the second increase, the speed becomes 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM.

Now, we sum these three speeds:
\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3:
\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step.

For Martin eating Cheerios every day for breakfast:
- He loses 1.25 pounds per week.

For 5 weeks, the total weight loss is:
\[
1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}

\]

Therefore, the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options is **2.5 pounds**."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we'll break down the invitations and responses step by step.

1. **Initial Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people.
   - Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of friends invited is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Additional Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these 10 friends say they will be bringing their spouses.

   - Given that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms contains 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
     \[
     200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total protein intake per week:**

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation as follows:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years. 

The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the number of hours George needs to work is:
\[ \boxed{260} \]"
"Certainly, let's solve this step by step.

Given that the angles in a triangle sum up to 180 degrees, and we have one angle that is twice the smallest angle and another that is three times the smallest angle, we can denote the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. Therefore, the angles can be expressed as \( x \), \( 2x \), and \( 3x \).

The equation representing the sum of the angles in the triangle is:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

And the angle that is three times the smallest angle is:
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"To find out how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first calculate the plane's speed. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so its speed is:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, to find out how long it would take to travel 2000 miles at this speed, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a focus on the calculations.

First, we determine Ruiz's hourly rate. Since Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, we calculate the hourly rate as follows:

\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Next, we find out Marissa's hourly rate. Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly rate as:

\[
\text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[
\text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the combined total:

\[
\text{Total chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[
\boxed{1260}

"Sure, let's break down the spending and calculate Howard's remaining money step by step.

1. **Monday's Spending:** Howard spends $8.
2. **Tuesday's Spending:** On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
3. **Wednesday's Spending:** On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, which is \(4 \times 16 = 64\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the spending:
\[
8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
\]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much he has left after his spending, we subtract the total spending from his initial amount:
\[
100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Howard has \(\boxed{12}\) dollars left."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.50 per cup. So, his earnings for the first 4 hours are calculated as follows:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30.00 \]

For the next 2 hours, he sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at $0.60 per cup. So, his earnings for the next 2 hours are:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12.00 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total earnings:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"To determine how many years Jeremy's tires need to be replaced, we start by calculating the total number of rotations the tires go through in a month. Given that the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles driven, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we first find the rotations per mile:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the total rotations for 400 miles:

\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

Now, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations the tires can undergo by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Total months} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert 72 months into years:

\[ \text{Total years} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how much each pump costs in cents, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total Cost of the Bottle**: The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
2. **Washes per Bottle**: The directions state that 2 pumps give 120 washes, so each pump gives 60 washes.
3. **Total Washes per Bottle**: Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washes per bottle is 2 pumps * 60 washes per pump = 120 washes.
4. **Cost per Wash**: The cost per wash is $24.00 / 120 washes = $0.20 per wash.
5. **Cost per Pump**: Since each pump gives 60 washes and each wash costs $0.20, the cost per pump is 60 washes * $0.20 per wash = $12.00.
6. **Convert to Cents**: $12.00 is equivalent to 1200 cents.

Therefore, each pump costs 1200 cents. The correct answer is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

Joe has $50 to spend on an outfit. The shirt he picks out is originally priced at $25, but there's a 30% discount. The discount amount for the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts he picks out are originally priced at $35, with a 30% discount. The discount amount for the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
So, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Adding the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts gives us the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Now, subtracting the total cost of the outfit from Joe's initial amount of $50:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. We know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. To find out how much butter he needs for 4 dozen croissants a day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of butter needed for one dozen croissants:**
   \[
   \text{Butter per dozen} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make per day:**
   \[
   \text{Dozens per day} = 4
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week:**
   \[
   \text{Days in a week} = 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total dozens per week} = 4 \text{ dozens/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozens}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozens of croissants:**
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 28 \text{ dozens} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 28 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first calculate the cost for each street.

For Monica's street:
- Length: 150 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 29100 \, \text{dollars}
\]

For Lewis' street:
- Length: 490 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 94860 \, \text{dollars}

Now, we find the difference in cost:

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = 94860 \, \text{dollars} - 29100 \, \text{dollars} = 65760 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Therefore, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street is **65760 dollars**."
"Certainly, let's break down the funding allocation for John's research again to find the total cost.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which totals 50 months.
   - The first 5 months are already covered by the initial funding.
   - Therefore, the extended period is 45 months.

3. **Funding for Extended Period:**
   - Each month after the first 5 months costs 50% more than the initial $20,000 per month.
   - The cost per month for the extended period is $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000.
   - The total funding for the extended 45 months is 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000.

4. **Total Funding:**
   - Adding the initial funding and the extended funding gives us the total cost.
   - Total cost = Initial funding + Extended funding
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is **$1,450,000**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as if I'm Fatima, focusing on the meat consumption for each player:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate beef tips, which are 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce. So, that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound equals 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces.

Now, we add up the meat consumption:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.
2. Determine the total amount of water used in a year.
3. Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of loads of laundry Gary does in a year.**

Gary does laundry twice a week. There are 52 weeks in a year.
\[
\text{Total loads per year} = 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of water used in a year.**

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water.
\[
\text{Total gallons of water used per year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the water used in a year.**

A gallon of water costs $0.15.
\[
\text{Total cost of water used per year} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

Thus, the total amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kilobytes per second (kb/s). To convert this to megabytes per second (Mb/s), we use the conversion factor that 1 megabyte (Mb) equals 1000 kilobytes (kb). Therefore, we divide 20 kb/s by 1000 to get the speed in Mb/s:

\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} \div 1000 = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data Ashley can get in one hour. Since there are 3600 seconds in an hour, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600:

\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

So, Ashley’s internet connection speed in megabytes per hour (Mb/h) is 72 Mb/h.

The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

For the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. So, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the remaining four days is:

- The price of a gold jewel \( G \) is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel.
- The price of a silver jewel \( S \) is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.

First, we calculate the price of the gold jewel:
\[ G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the price of the silver jewel:
\[ S = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we find the total price for all three jewels:

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's define the variables:
- \( v_B \) = speed of Bob = 55 miles per hour
- \( v_T \) = speed of Tom = 70 miles per hour
- \( d \) = distance between Bob and Tom = 75 miles

The relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap is the difference in their speeds:
\[ v_{\text{relative}} = v_T - v_B = 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The time \( t \) it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap can be calculated using the formula:
\[ t = \frac{d}{v_{\text{relative}}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ t = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final numerical answer is:

Manny signed up for 10 karate classes that cost a total of $60. His parents will not sign him up for karate again if the cost per class exceeds $10. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

First, let's calculate the cost per class if Manny misses some classes. If he misses \( n \) classes, he will have \( 10 - n \) classes left to pay for. The total cost remains $60, so the cost per class becomes:
\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - n} \]

We need this cost to be at most $10:
\[ \frac{60}{10 - n} \leq 10 \]

To solve for \( n \), we can rearrange the inequality:
\[ 60 \leq 10(10 - n) \]
\[ 60 \leq 100 - 10n \]
\[ 10n \leq 40 \]
\[ n \leq 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. Therefore, the number of classes he can miss is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many miles Lynn ran.

First, we know Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

We also know that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, if we let Lynn's distance be \( L \), we can write:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = L + 3 \]

Given that Reggie's distance is 20 miles, we can set up the equation:

\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

To find \( L \), we subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ L = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

First, we determine the cost of one apple:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Therefore, the cost of one apple is \( \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \) dollars.

Next, we determine the cost of one orange:
- Three oranges cost $3.30.
- Therefore, the cost of one orange is \( \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \) dollars.

Now, we calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
- The cost for 5 apples is \( 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \) dollars.
- The cost for 5 oranges is \( 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \) dollars.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
- Total cost = \( 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \) dollars.

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as if I'm Fatima.

To dig a hole that is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep, we first calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

So, the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet.

Now, we know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

   \text{Cost of each pair of dress pants} = \frac{750}{5} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   James buys 10 pairs of dress pants.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits.
   \[
   \text{Total number of dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30
   \]
   Each dress shirt costs $60.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of suits} + \text{Cost of dress pants} + \text{Cost of dress shirts}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of everything is **$10800**."
"Certainly! Let's break down the calculation again for clarity, keeping in mind the details of the question.

The news website publishes an average of 20 articles every day, and there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the news website in February is:
\[ 20 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 560 \text{ articles} \]

The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles every day, and again, there are 28 days in February. So, the total number of articles published by the sister company in February is:
\[ 10 \text{ articles/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Adding these together gives us the total number of articles published by both websites in February:
\[ 560 \text{ articles} + 280 \text{ articles} = 840 \text{ articles} \]

Therefore, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is:
\[ \boxed{840} \]"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as if this is the first time I'm tackling the problem.

First, we need to find out how much flour is in one bag. The problem states that each bag is divided into 8 portions, and each portion weighs 2 kilograms. So, we calculate the total weight of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion:

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, we need to find out the total amount of flour in three bags. Since one bag contains 16 kilograms, three bags will contain:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 16 \text{ kilograms per bag} = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{48}\) kilograms."
"Sure, let's calculate the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley again.

For Alisa:

The distance Alisa biked is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

For Stanley:
- Speed: 10 miles per hour
- Time: 2.5 hours

The distance Stanley biked is:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding these distances together:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find out how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of soil and clay he encounters.

1. **Time to dig through soil:**
   - Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
   - He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
   - Time to dig through soil = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

2. **Time to dig through clay:**
   - Bill digs at a rate of half the speed through clay, which is 2 feet per hour.
   - He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
   - Time to dig through clay = \(\frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Total time to dig the well:**
   - Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
   - Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

Therefore, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours."

"Sure, let's break down the calculations again with a fresh perspective.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost before the discount was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]

She got a $2 discount, so the final price Clara paid was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

The next day, the price of each pomegranate shot up to $30, but the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we calculate the total cost without the discount:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]

Then, we apply the 10% discount:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the total amount Ariadne made in two months.

First, we know that the sales from red hats in the first month were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the total amount earned from green hats in the first month is:

\[ 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne earned in the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the total amount she earned in the second month is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the total sales of the first month and the total sales of the second month:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage.

James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which totals 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour of free carriage time, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour costs $15.
- Each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour.

Let's calculate the cost for each of the 3 paid hours:
- The first hour costs $15.
- The second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.
- The third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, we sum up the costs of the three paid hours:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $60

Adding these together:
\[ 15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \]

Therefore, the total amount James paid is:

- Sally's bank account started with $200.
- Now, her bank account holds $420.
- Her weekly wage should be $300.

First, we calculate the total amount Sally earned this week by subtracting the initial amount from the final amount in her bank account:
\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

Next, we compare this amount to her weekly wage to find out how much was withheld:
\[ 300 - 220 = 80 \]

Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80. 

The correct answer is:
\[

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. If each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, and she's inviting 16 guests, we first calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, to find out how many dozens of eggs are needed, we divide the total number of whole eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen eggs} \]

So, the number of dozens of eggs Lori will need is:

\[
\text{Total pages} = 200
\]
\[
\text{Pages per day} = 10
\]
\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading. The deadline is in 30 days:

\[
\text{Deadline} = 30 \text{ days}

"Certainly, let's solve this step by step.

We have two equations based on the information given:
1. \( S + G = 20 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \) (total number of legs)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now, we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To find the number of sheep \( S \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep \( S \) is 15.

To verify, we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, let's check the number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, so he has 1 toy per dog.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so he needs 8 more toys to have one toy per dog. Therefore, he needs 8 toys initially.
3. After buying the toys, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Initially, there were 4 dogs, so twice as many more dogs means there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) more dogs. This means there are now \(4 + 8 = 12\) dogs in the shelter.
4. Since he needs 1 toy per dog, he needs 12 toys now.
5. When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. This means he now has 12 - 3 = 9 dogs in the shelter.
6. Since he needs 1 toy per dog, he needs 9 toys now.

Adding up all the toys he needs:
- Initially, he needed 8 toys.
- After buying the toys, he needed 12 toys.
- When he came back again, he needed 9 toys.

The total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 + 9 = 29\).

Therefore, the total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{29}\)."

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Jack is one adult, and there are 8 other adults.

First, calculate the total weight of the 8 other adults:
\[ 8 \times 80 \text{ kg} = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Now, add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 80 \text{ kg} + 640 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg. To find out how much they will exceed the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, they will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg. The correct answer is:

"Given the information, let's break it down step by step:

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

From the problem, we know:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = Tr + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \).

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substitute \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

We know Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40. First, let's calculate the total cost of the lollipops:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the total cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we calculate:

The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, the cost of the vaccines is straightforward: 2 vaccines at $20 each, so that's $40.

Next, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). So, the heartworm check costs \( 0.6T \).

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him, so the amount he leaves with is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find the price of the crate of fruit.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - Each crate has 5 bananas.
   - The price of one banana is $1.0 (since it's twice the price of one apple, and one apple costs $0.5).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each crate has 12 apples.
   - The price of one apple is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Each crate has 7 oranges.
   - The price of one orange is $3.0 (since it's three times the price of one banana, and one banana costs $1.0).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - Summing the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges:
   \[
   5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get.

First, we calculate the total number of people attending the function:
\[ 42 \text{ adults} + 15 \text{ babies} = 57 \text{ people} \]

Next, we know the restaurant has 8 high chairs. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs} \]

Adding the high chairs and regular chairs together gives us the total number of chairs currently available:
\[ 40 \text{ regular chairs} + 8 \text{ high chairs} = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of people:

1. **Adam** has collected 50 points.
2. **Betty** collected 30% more points than Adam. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Points collected by Betty} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Marta** collected 3 times more points than Tom, and Tom has 30 points. So:
   \[
   \text{Points collected by Marta} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]
4. **Tom** has 30 points.

Now, let's sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 90 + 30 = 235
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

First, we calculate the total number of fireworks in the display:
- There are 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box contains 20 fireworks.
- So, the total number of fireworks is \(15 \times 20 = 300\).

Next, we determine how many of these fireworks Hannah will see. Since her house is at a right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks:
- 40% of 300 fireworks is \(0.40 \times 300 = 120\).

Additionally, Hannah will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard:
- The total number of fireworks in these 3 boxes is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of fireworks Hannah will see from the display to the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard:

"To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we start by noting that Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so Gordy's truck can haul:

\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Given that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds, we can set up the equation:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]
\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle. If the cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second, we first find the turtle's speed. Since the cat is 5 times faster, the turtle's speed is:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we use the formula for distance:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the turtle's speed and the given time:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to reach their goal of $6300, given that they have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours and that they raise an equal amount in every hour.

First, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we find out how much more money is needed to reach the goal:
\[ \text{Remaining amount needed} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Now, we calculate the number of additional hours required to raise the remaining amount:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Finally, we add the initial 3 hours to the additional hours to get the total number of hours required:

"Certainly, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate the production rates for each type of ice cream:

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so the production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so the production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Next, we calculate the total production for 48 hours:

For chocolate ice cream:
- At a rate of 50 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- At a rate of 12.5 quarts per hour, in 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Adding these together gives the total production:
\[ 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \]

So, the total number of quarts made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"Sure, let's break down the costs again to ensure we get the total bill accurately.

First, we calculate the cost for each type of baked good:

1. Croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each
\[ 5 \times 3.00 = 15.00 \]

2. Cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each
\[ 4 \times 2.50 = 10.00 \]

3. Mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each
\[ 3 \times 4.00 = 12.00 \]

4. Blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each
\[ 13 \times 1.00 = 13.00 \]

Now, we sum up these amounts to get the total cost before the discount:
\[ 15.00 + 10.00 + 12.00 + 13.00 = 50.00 \]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his total purchase. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $50.00:
\[ 0.10 \times 50.00 = 5.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:
\[ 50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00 \]

So, Marcus' total bill is:
\[ \boxed{45.00} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer approach.

The deal is ""buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."" This means for every 3 scoops, Erin only pays for 2 scoops. Each scoop costs $1.50.

First, let's calculate the cost for 3 scoops:
\[ 2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50 = \$3.00 \]

Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

This means Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which totals to:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, the total number of scoops Erin should buy is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as if this is the first time I'm answering the question.

Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's calculate the number of days in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"

"Sure, let me refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

James decides to pick some blueberries. It costs $20 to go picking and then an additional $1.5 per pound. He picked 30 pounds of blueberries. To find out how much he saved compared to buying them at the store for $2.5 per pound, we first calculate the total cost of picking the blueberries.

The cost for the blueberries he picked is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the cost to go picking, the total cost for James is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

The savings James made by picking the blueberries himself is:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the total amount of money the company paid for the computers at the new prices.

Initially, the company planned to buy 500 computers at $700 each. Therefore, the total planned cost was:

\[ 500 \times 700 = 350,000 \]

However, the price of each computer increased by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]
\[ \text{New price per computer} = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, we need to find the total cost for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:

\[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

First, we calculate the cost of the pencils and erasers:
- The cost of one pencil is $0.50, and you bought 6 pencils, so:
  \[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]
- The cost of one eraser is $0.25, and you bought 8 erasers, so:
  \[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

You paid $10 for the pencils and erasers. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change you would get is $5.00."

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Helga is a talented clog dancer in Slovenia. When she dances with both hands at her sides, she can tap her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute simultaneously. When she raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute for each foot. If she dances for a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 of those minutes, we need to find the total number of taps she makes.

1. **Dancing with both hands at her sides:**
   - Right foot tap rate: 300 taps per minute
   - Left foot tap rate: 250 taps per minute
   - Combined tap rate: \(300 + 250 = 550\) taps per minute

2. **Dancing with arms raised:**
   - Right foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
   - Left foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
   - Combined tap rate: \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute

3. **Total time dancing:**
   - Total time: 5 minutes
   - Time with arms raised: 2 minutes
   - Time with both hands at her sides: \(5 - 2 = 3\) minutes

4. **Calculate the number of taps for each part:**
   - Taps with both hands at her sides:
     \[
     550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps}
     \]
   - Taps with arms raised:
     \[
     400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps}
     \]

5. **Total number of taps:**
   \[
   1650 \text{ taps} + 800 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps}
   \]

Therefore, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the costs and savings for Ron again, focusing on the calculations.

1. **Fine for unauthorized road maintenance:** $120
2. **Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt:** 
   - Each bucket costs $25.
   - Therefore, 3 buckets cost \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives us the total cost for Ron if he fixes the pothole himself:
\[ 120 + 75 = 195 \]

Now, we compare this total cost to the potential damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed:
- The potential damage to his car is $450.

To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage:
\[ 450 - 195 = 255 \]

Therefore, Ron saves:
\[ \boxed{255} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Initially, the restaurant has:
- 170 normal chairs
- 23 baby chairs

Now, 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs are sent to the carpenter for repair. So, we subtract these from the initial counts:

- Remaining normal chairs: \(170 - 20 = 150\)
- Remaining baby chairs: \(23 - 13 = 10\)

Adding these remaining chairs together gives us the total number of chairs left in the restaurant:

- Total remaining chairs: \(150 + 10 = 160\)

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate the total number of slices of pizza ordered. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we determine how many slices Bryce and two of his friends ate. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Then, we calculate how many slices the two remaining friends ate. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends, we get the total number of slices eaten:

\[ 24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step.

The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time it takes the cat. So, we calculate the time it takes for the dog to eat the sausages:

\[
\text{Time for the dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we add their times together and divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes. 

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer persona.

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we determine how many windows Hannah smashes. She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

First, the number of windows smashed from the students' cars:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ 112 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Sure, let's go through the calculation again with a fresh perspective.

To find the percentage of blue spools of thread, we start by adding up all the spools:

- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Total number of spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green)
Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150

Next, we calculate the total number of blue spools:

Total number of blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue)
Total number of blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools:

Percentage of blue spools = (Total number of blue spools / Total number of spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100

Let's do the calculation:

\[
\frac{60}{150} = 0.4
\]

\[
0.4 \times 100 = 40\%
\]

So, the percentage of blue spools of thread is 40%.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."

1. **Calculate the number of people who voted by midday:**
   - Total number of people initially: 5000
   - Fraction of people who voted by midday: \( \frac{2}{5} \)
   - Number of people who voted by midday: \( 5000 \times \frac{2}{5} = 2000 \)

2. **Determine the number of people remaining after midday:**
   - Number of people remaining after midday: \( 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \)

3. **Calculate the number of people who voted by 16:00:**
   - Fraction of remaining people who voted by 16:00: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Number of people who voted by 16:00: \( 3000 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2000 \)

4. **Determine the number of people who did not vote by 16:00:**
   - Number of people who did not vote by 16:00: \( 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \)

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \( 1000 \)."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day. A pack of gum contains 15 pieces. To find out how many packs of gum he will need for 30 days, we first calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in 30 days:

\[ \text{Total pieces of gum} = 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of gum are required to get 120 pieces. Since each pack contains 15 pieces:

\[ \text{Number of packs} = \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many boxes of graham crackers are needed, let's break it down step by step:

First, calculate the total number of smores required:
- Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, so that's \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores.
- Each of the 6 adults wants 1 smore, so that's \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores.
- Adding these together, the total number of smores needed is \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores.

Next, determine how many graham cracker bases are needed:
- Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 smores.
- To find out how many sleeves are needed for 24 smores, divide the total smores by the number of smores per sleeve: \(24 \div 8 = 3\) sleeves.

Finally, calculate how many boxes are needed:
- Each box contains 3 sleeves.
- To find out how many boxes are needed for 3 sleeves, divide the total sleeves by the number of sleeves per box: \(3 \div 3 = 1\) box.

Therefore, they will need \(\boxed{1}\) box of graham crackers."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

First, we know Dora is 15 years old. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate Dora's father's age as follows:

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. Therefore, we calculate Dora's mother's age as:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87. 

If this were a multiple-choice question, the correct answer would be:

"Certainly, let's break it down step by step to find out how many votes candidate C received.

First, we calculate the votes for candidate A, who got 20% of the total votes. Given there are 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we determine the votes for candidate B. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. So, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{Additional votes for candidate B} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

Therefore, the total votes for candidate B are:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, to find out how many votes candidate C received, we subtract the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - 50 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 50 \]

So, candidate C received 50 votes. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a fresh perspective.

Initially, Boris has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so:

\[ \text{Beck's initial apples} = 100 - 23 = 77 \]

When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, the number of apples each person has changes:

\[ \text{Boris's apples after giving 10} = 100 - 10 = 90 \]
\[ \text{Beck's apples after receiving 10} = 77 + 10 = 87 \]

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris:

\[ \text{Difference in apples} = 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Peter starts with 32 ounces of water. He uses water for three types of ice cubes: giant, medium, and small.

1. **Giant Cubes**: Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water, and he makes 3 of them.
   - Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

2. **Medium Cubes**: Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water, and he makes 7 of them.
   - Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

3. **Small Cubes**: Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water, and he makes 8 of them.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we add up the water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used: \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
- Initial amount of water: 32 ounces.
- Water left: \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

So, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with the persona of Fatima.

First, we know Clara has 20 books, and she has twice as many books as Steven. So, to find out how many books Steven has, we divide Clara's books by 2:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we know Alice has 6 more books than Steven. So, we add 6 to the number of books Steven has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we need to find the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the items Cecelia bought:

1. **Cost of 10-gallon jars:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 10-gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of 16 half-gallon jars:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding these together gives us the total amount Cecelia spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is:

\[
\boxed{98}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

We have a class of 50 students. Here's the breakdown of their hobbies:
- 10 students like to bake.
- 5 students like to play basketball.

This means the rest of the students, who are \(50 - 10 - 5 = 35\), like to play either video games or music.

The problem states that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Given that the total number of students who like to play video games or music is 35, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number who like to play music from this total. So, the number of students who like to play video games is \(35 - 10 = 25\).

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Sure, let me clarify this for you. Initially, Jeremy saw 12 birds. When he threw a stone, he scared away 1/3 of those birds, which is 4 birds. So, the number of birds left after the stone was thrown is 12 - 4 = 8 birds. Then, 20 more birds joined the backyard. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is 8 + 20 = 28 birds. 

So, the final number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

1. **Total number of students in the two classes is 80.**
2. **Each class has the same number of students, so each class has 80 / 2 = 40 students.**
3. **In each class, 40% of the students are girls.**
   - To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40: 0.40 * 40 = 16 girls.
4. **The total number of students in each class is 40.**
   - Since there are 16 girls, the remaining students must be boys.
   - Therefore, the number of boys in each class is 40 - 16 = 24.

So, the number of boys in each class is **24**."
"Sure, let me walk you through the problem again with a fresh perspective.

Initially, there were 2 slices of cake on the plate. Mara added 3 more slices, so the total became 5 slices. Then, she tripled the number of slices, which means:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ slices} \]

After that, Mara ate 2 slices, leaving:
\[ 15 - 2 = 13 \text{ slices} \]

Then, her friend stole 5 slices, so the number of slices remaining is:
\[ 13 - 5 = 8 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as if I'm Fatima.

Mark buys 3 packs of old magic cards for a total of $1800 each. So, the total cost is:

\[
3 \times 1800 = 5400 \text{ dollars}
\]

He gets 1 card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. The total value of these cards is:

\[
4000 + 1000 + (30 \times 50) = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
6500 - 5400 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the profit Mark made is:

\[
\boxed{1100}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step for clarity.

First, we calculate the total cost for the first amusement park:
- Cost for each adult at the first park is $26.
- Cost for each child at the first park is $12.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children in the family.

Total cost for adults at the first park:
\[ 2 \times 26 = 52 \]

Total cost for children at the first park:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Total cost for the first amusement park:
\[ 52 + 24 = 76 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the second amusement park:
- Cost for each adult at the second park is $14.
- Cost for each child at the second park is $10.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children in the family.

Total cost for adults at the second park:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]

Total cost for children at the second park:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Total cost for the second amusement park:
\[ 28 + 20 = 48 \]

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
\[ 76 - 48 = 28 \]

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, we need to calculate the difference in cost per day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

1. **Daily cost from the old vendor:**
   - The old vendor sells tomatoes for $0.5 each.
   - The vendor buys 500 tomatoes a day.
   - Daily cost from the old vendor = \( 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \).

2. **Daily cost from the new vendor:**
   - The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.4 each.
   - The vendor still buys 500 tomatoes a day.
   - Daily cost from the new vendor = \( 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \).

3. **Daily savings:**
   - Daily savings = Daily cost from the old vendor - Daily cost from the new vendor
   - Daily savings = \$250/day - \$200/day = \$50/day.

4. **Weekly savings:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Weekly savings = Daily savings \(\times\) 7 days
   - Weekly savings = \$50/day \(\times\) 7 days = \$350.

Therefore, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with the persona of Fatima.

Given that Sean has 56 marbles, we know Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, we calculate Carl's marbles as follows:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can find out how many marbles Cal has by doubling Sean's amount:

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add their marbles together:

\[ \text{Combined marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have is 336."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We need to determine how many groups of equal size we can form with 54 students if we are to have 12 groups.
2. If we divide 54 students into 12 groups, each group would have:
   \[
   \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \text{ students per group}
   \]
   Since we can't have half a student, this division is not possible with whole groups.

3. Now, let's consider forming 6 groups instead. If we divide 54 students into 6 groups, each group would have:
   \[
   \frac{54}{6} = 9 \text{ students per group}
   \]
   This division results in whole numbers, so it's possible to form 6 groups of 9 students each.

4. To find out how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups, we subtract the number of groups we can form (6) from the total number of groups required (12):
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ more groups}
   \]

Therefore, the number of additional groups needed is 6.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

To find out how many chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, we first need to calculate the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month.

In one 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
- During weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs each day, so in 20 days, she rents out \(60 \times 20 = 1200\) chairs.
- During weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs each day, so in 8 days, she rents out \(100 \times 8 = 800\) chairs.

Adding these together, the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is \(1200 + 800 = 2000\).

Since we are looking at two 4-week months, we multiply the total for one month by 2:
\[2000 \times 2 = 4000\].

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[
\boxed{4000}

"Sure, let's go through the sequence of events again to find out how many bananas Gunther found in the pile.

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther starts with 48 bananas.

2. **Arnold steals half:**
   Arnold steals half of the bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]

3. **Gunther adds 25 bananas:**
   Gunther adds 25 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas after Gunther adds 25} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]

4. **Arnold steals another 12 bananas:**
   Arnold steals 12 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 49 - 12 = 37
   \]

5. **Gunther adds 6 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 6 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas after Gunther adds 6} = 37 + 6 = 43
   \]

So, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that feels more natural to me.

The total monthly electricity bill is $100, and there are 4 roommates. To find out how much each roommate pays each month, we divide the total monthly cost by the number of roommates:

\[
\text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
\]

Now, to find out how much each roommate pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[
\text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300
\]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

The final numerical answer is:

- 4 dozen plates, which is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

When the items were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. So, the number of glasses and plates left are:
- Remaining glasses: \(96 - 10 = 86\)
- Remaining plates: \(48 - 6 = 42\)

Adding these together, the total number of items Jeff has now is:
- \(86\) glasses + \(42\) plates = \(128\) items.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{128}

"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. That means she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons. After this trade, she has 3 small stickers left and 67 large stickers (40 original + 27 traded).

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. So, she trades 33.5 large stickers, which we can round to 33 large stickers (since she can't trade half a sticker), for 33 large buttons. This leaves her with 34 large stickers (67 original - 33 traded).

Finally, she trades the remaining 34 large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 102 small buttons (34 large stickers * 3 small buttons per large sticker).

Adding up all the buttons she has:
- 27 large buttons from the first trade
- 33 large buttons from the second trade
- 102 small buttons from the third trade

Total buttons: \( 27 + 33 + 102 = 162 \)

So, by the end, Lorraine has 162 buttons. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{162}\)."
"Sure, let me calculate this again with a fresh perspective.

Joey played:
- 2 matches on Monday,
- 1 match on Friday,
- Double the number of matches he played on Monday on Saturday, which means he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Adding these up:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \text{ matches} \]

So, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week. The correct answer is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step.

If the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, and there are 33 people on the council, we can set up the equation to find the number of votes in favor.

Let \( x \) be the number of votes against the new regulation. Then, the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). Given that the total number of people on the council is 33, we have:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{22}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again with a fresh perspective:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - Number of students needing XS shirts = 11

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of students needing S shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of students needing M shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of students needing L shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of students needing XL shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, summing up the number of students needing each size of shirt:

\[
\text{Total shirts} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
\]

\[
\text{Total shirts} = 75
\]

So, the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order is 75."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate 20% of 50 people who think horse #2 will win:
\[ 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ people} \]

This leaves us with:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people} \]

Next, 60% of these 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ people} \]

The rest of the people, which is:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know that one third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. This means:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times \text{(number of Pomeranian puppies)} = 6 \]

To find the total number of Pomeranian puppies, we multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ \text{(number of Pomeranian puppies)} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Since the Pomeranian puppies make up two thirds of all the puppies, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{(total number of puppies)} = 18 \]

To find the total number of puppies, we solve for the total:
\[ \text{(total number of puppies)} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Jana has a total of 27 puppies. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"

\]

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera:
\[
200 - 115 = 85
\]

So, Jayden needs an additional $85 to buy the camera. The final numerical answer is:

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many cases of shingles the third house will need.

Given:
- The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250.
- The first house needs half the number of cases as the second house.
- The third house needs double the number of cases as the first house.

Let's denote the number of cases needed for the second house as \( x \).

Then:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases for all three houses can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house, needing double the first house, will need:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, Sam would have to spend **60 dollars** to make 4 liters of juice."
"Sure, let's break down the problem again with a fresh perspective.

1. **Determine the number of books Ahmed read:**
   - We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour.
   - According to the problem, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in the same hour.
   - Let \( A \) represent the number of books Ahmed read.
   - Therefore, \( 2A = 300 \).
   - Solving for \( A \):
     \[
     A = \frac{300}{2} = 150

"Sure, let's break down Tanya's earnings for Monday and Wednesday again, focusing on the details.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Since she teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, she qualifies for the additional $5:
\[ \text{Total earnings for Monday} = \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not qualify for the additional $5 per day since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not qualify for the additional $5 per day, her total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \$60 \]

**Total earnings for both days:**
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \$305 + \$60 = \$365 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \(\boxed{365}\) dollars for these two days of teaching."

So, the number of vanilla scents sold is 21 more than the number of fruity scents sold. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for to make a total of $135, we first calculate the total amount he makes from selling the eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, so:

\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

This means Bennet has already made $60 from the eggplants. To reach his goal of $135, he needs to make an additional:

\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Since he has 25 ears of corn, he needs to sell each ear for:

\[ \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears}} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3. The correct answer is:

**$3**"
"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the breakdown again:

Tatiana has a total of 12 hours available over the weekend (7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday). She spends 3 hours reading and 3 hours playing video games. The remaining time is spent playing soccer.

First, we calculate the remaining time after reading and playing video games:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

So, Tatiana spends 6 hours playing soccer. To find the percentage of her weekend spent playing soccer, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave half of them to Brandon:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \text{ pencils}
\]

So, after giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony has:

\[
50 - 25 = 25 \text{ pencils left}
\]

Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \text{ pencils}
\]

After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:

\[
25 - 15 = 10 \text{ pencils}
\]

Therefore, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how long Jack is gone from home.

First, Jack drives 150 miles to the museum at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the return trip is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back home is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time Jack is gone from home is 10 hours. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

Henry needs 4 wheels for each car, and he has 57 cars. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:
\[ 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

For the motorcycles, he needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles. So, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is:
\[ 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of wheels needed:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels he has:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

So, the number of wheels left is:
\[ 276 \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{276} \]"
"Sure, let's calculate the price of the laptop after a 20% discount.

The original price of the laptop is $1000. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1000:

\[ 20\% \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

Subtracting the discount from the original price gives us:

\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, after applying the 20% discount, the price you have to pay is $800.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 800 \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step with a fresh perspective.

First, Mike has 600 movies in total. A third of these are in series, so:

\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]

This means the remaining movies are:

\[ \text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Out of these 400 non-series movies, 40% are older movies, so:

\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

The rest of the non-series movies are not older:

\[ \text{Number of non-older non-series movies} = 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, let's calculate the costs:

- The cost for the series movies, which can be bought at $6 each:
\[ \text{Cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]

- The cost for the non-older non-series movies, which cost $10 each:
\[ \text{Cost for non-older non-series movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]

- The cost for the older movies, which cost $5 each:
\[ \text{Cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400 \]

Therefore, the total cost to replace the movies is:

\[ \boxed{4400} \]"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we'll calculate the cost for each type of fruit he picked and then add them up.

1. **Peaches:**
   - Cost per pound: $2.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for peaches: \( 6 \times \$2.00 = \$12.00 \)

2. **Plums:**
   - Cost per pound: $1.00
   - Pounds picked: 8
   - Total cost for plums: \( 8 \times \$1.00 = \$8.00 \)

3. **Apricots:**
   - Cost per pound: $3.00
   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots: \( 6 \times \$3.00 = \$18.00 \)

Now, we sum the costs for all the fruits:
\[
\$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00
\]

Therefore, Winston spent a total of \(\boxed{38}\) dollars on fruit."
"To find the total distance to the vacation spot, I'll break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the distance driven:
- They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- Distance driven = Speed × Time = 50 miles/hour × 6 hours = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked:
- They hiked for 1.5 hours.
- The average speed when hiking is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half of the driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
- Therefore, the hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
- Distance hiked = Speed × Time = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
- Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

So, the total distance to their vacation spot is 330 miles."
"Sure, let's break down the problem again with a fresh perspective.

Ava and Emma are playing a video game level. They receive points based on the following criteria:
- 10 points for every enemy they jump on.
- 5 points for each berry they collect.
- 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level.

Given:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Let's denote:
- \( E_A \) as the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- \( E_E \) as the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- \( B_A \) as the number of berries Ava collects.
- \( B_E \) as the number of berries Emma collects.

From the given information:
- \( E_A = E_E + 8 \)
- \( B_A = B_E + 3 \)
- \( T_A = T_E + 4 \)

Now, let's calculate the points for each player:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E_A - E_E) = 10 \times 8 = 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (B_A - B_E) = 5 \times 3 = 15 \)
- Points from time left: \( 30 \times (T_E - T_A) = 30 \times (-4) = -120 \)

So, the total scores are:
- Ava's total score: \( 80 + 15 - 120 = -25 \)
- Emma's total score: \( 10 \times (-8) + 5 \times (-3) + 30 \times (-4) = -80 - 15 - 120 = -215 \)

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = -25 - (-215) = -25 + 215 = 190 \]

Therefore, the difference between their scores is \( 190 \).

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{190} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know that two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so together they cost:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars, the cost of the other two pizzas combined is:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, each of them costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which means:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other two days, they ride twice the usual number of times, so:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Adding these together gives us the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step.

Bob originally had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white. He bought 17 more fish from the pet store, and after adding them, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's denote the number of white fish he bought as \( w \) and the number of orange fish he bought as \( o \). We know that:
\[ o + w = 17 \]

After adding these fish, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish. This gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

Let's simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Now, substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2w + 5 + w = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find the number of orange fish he bought, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

We can verify the solution by checking the conditions of the problem:
- The total number of fish bought is \( o + w = 13 + 4 = 17 \).
- After adding the fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- The number of orange fish is indeed twice the number of white fish: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \).

The solution is correct. The number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we first calculate the total distance he drives in a week. Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, that's 5 days. Each day, he drives a round trip of 5 miles, so the round trip distance is 10 miles per day. Therefore, the total distance driven in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Andy consumes in a week. Given that his car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the number of gallons used per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of the gas. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, then the cost per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 15 \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch.

Carrie has ten twenties, and each twenty is worth $20. Therefore, the total amount in twenties is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She also has 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the total amount in quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35. She also spent 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the amounts spent on quarters and twenties gives us the total amount spent for lunch:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his garden.

First, we calculate the total number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

"Certainly! Let's break it down step by step.

Given that Samwell's store sold a total of 40 TVs, we know the distribution of these sales:
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, let's calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, to find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is:

"Sure, let me help you with that.

Mike needed a new pair of jeans, and they were advertised 25% off. The original price of the jeans was $40.00. To find out how much money Mike will have left after paying with a $50.00 bill, we first need to calculate the discounted price.

The discount amount is 25% of $40.00, which is:
\[ 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \]

So, the sale price of the jeans is:
\[ 40.00 - 10.00 = 30.00 \]

Now, if Mike pays with a $50.00 bill, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50.00 - 30.00 = 20.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20.00} \]"
"Sure, let me calculate this again from scratch.

Initially, the company has 200 employees. Each month, they hire 20 new employees. After three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

So, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

"Sure, let's break down the caroling schedule again with a fresh perspective.

Carrie and the choir plan to sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, and ""Jingle Bells"" once. ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long, and ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

First, we calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, so the total time is \(2 \times 150 = 300\) seconds.

Next, we calculate the total time for ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once, so the total time is \(1 \times 240 = 240\) seconds.

Now, we add the total times for both songs to find the total caroling time:
- Total caroling time = 300 seconds (for ""Deck the Halls"") + 240 seconds (for ""Jingle Bells"") = 540 seconds.

Therefore, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds.

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally.

First, we calculate Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
1. **Initial hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, the raise:** $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, the raise:** $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Next, we calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours at each stage:
1. **Initial earnings (first 2 months):**
   \[
   10 \text{ hours/month} \times 2 \text{ months} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. **Earnings after the raise (first anniversary):**
   \[
   11.50 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 230 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up Billy's total earnings:
\[
400 \text{ dollars} + 230 \text{ dollars} = 630 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate Sally's hourly wage:
1. **Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's initial salary:**
   \[
   10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

We calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours:
\[
10.50 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 210 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
\[
630 \text{ dollars} - 210 \text{ dollars} = 420 \text{ dollars}

Pierson scored 278 points. To find out how many points Nikita scored, we calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 more points. So, half of Pierson's score is 278 / 2 = 139 points. Adding 11 more points to this gives us Nikita's score: 139 + 11 = 150 points.

Now, to find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together: 278 + 150 = 428 points.

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428 points."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

We start by calculating the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes, with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ \text{Total number of teachers} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of trees planted by the students and teachers.

Each student plants 1 tree:
\[ \text{Total trees planted by students} = 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees:
\[ \text{Total trees planted by teachers} = 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, we add the trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted:
\[ \text{Total trees planted} = 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

So, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:
\[ \boxed{1240} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Bubbles currently has:
- 3 stuffed puppies
- 5 stuffed koalas
- 2 stuffed zebras
- 4 stuffed frogs

So, the total number of stuffed animals she currently has is:
\[ 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \]

She wants the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as \( x \).

After buying \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \).

We want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30%, so:
\[ \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to find out how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach her goal of 30 hours.

First, we calculate the hours played in the first 2 weeks:
- Kris plays half an hour every day for 14 days.
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate the hours played in the last week:
- Kris plays 2 hours every day for 7 days.
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add the hours played in both periods:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement is 9 hours."
"Sure, let's break it down again from the start.

To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

1. **First car:**
   - Speed: 60 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles

2. **Second car:**
   - Speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles

3. **Difference in distance:**
   - Distance of the second car: 140 miles
   - Distance of the first car: 120 miles
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final numerical answer is:
20 miles"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

The cost of the diamond is $600, and the cost of the gold is $300. So, the total cost before adding the premium is $600 + $300 = $900.

The premium is 30% of the total cost before the premium. So, the premium amount is 0.30 * $900 = $270.

Adding the premium to the total cost before the premium gives us the final amount James paid: $900 + $270 = $1170.

Therefore, the final amount James paid is $1170."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the overall pass rate for Janet's collection of results from Herbert Hoover Elementary School's annual standardized test.

First, we calculate the pass rates for each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Pass rate} = \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \text{ or } 68\%
   \]

2. **Fourth-grade pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Pass rate} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \text{ or } 40\%
   \]

3. **Fifth-grade pass rate:**
   The fifth-grade pass rate is twice the fourth-grade pass rate:
   \[
   \text{Fifth-grade pass rate} = 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \text{ or } 80\%
   \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass students:**
   \[
   \text{Number of third-grade pass students} = 340
   \]

2. **Fourth-grade pass students:**
   \[
   \text{Number of fourth-grade pass students} = 40
   \]

3. **Fifth-grade pass students:**
   \[
   \text{Number of fifth-grade pass students} = 0.80 \times 400 = 320
   \]

Now, we sum the number of students who passed in all grades:

\[
\text{Total number of pass students} = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700
\]

The total number of students tested is:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000
\]

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \text{ or } 70\%
\]

Thus, the school's overall pass rate is:

\[
\boxed{70\%}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic.

First, we calculate the total number of glass chips Milo has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we determine how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we have:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much tea was at the beginning of the party.

First, we calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students:
- Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea: \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- Sixteen students each drank 2 quarts of tea: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.

Adding these amounts together gives the total tea consumed:
\[6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}\]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students drank. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts}\]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[\frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons}\]

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as if it's the first time I'm tackling it.

Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, but since he only had 100 candies to start with, he needed to order more to meet the demand. After selling 100 candies, he ordered an additional 100 candies to replenish his stock. Now, Dale has a total of 200 candies (100 from the initial order plus 100 from the additional order).

Since he has already sold 150 candies, the number of candies he still needs to sell to sell all of his candy is:

200 (total candies now) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 candies.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 more candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, we start with the initial number of students, which is 10. Each month, the number of students doubles.

- **End of January:** \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students
- **End of February:** \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students
- **End of March:** \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students
- **End of April:** \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students
- **End of May:** \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students

Now, to find the additional students who joined by the end of May, we subtract the initial number of students from the number at the end of May:

\[320 - 10 = 310\]

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{310}\)"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Felix made $105 by climbing branches, and each branch costs $0.25. To find out how many branches he climbed in total, we divide the total money made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420
\]

Since this total was made over the course of a week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[
\text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60
\]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[
60
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Rose starts by picking:
- 3 flowers with 5 petals each, which totals \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
- 4 flowers with 6 petals each, which totals \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
- 5 flowers with 4 petals each, which totals \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
- 6 flowers with 7 petals each, which totals \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together gives the total number of petals initially:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\text{ petals}\]

Then, Rose drops 1 flower of each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals, which is \(1 \times 5 = 5\) petals.
- 1 flower with 6 petals, which is \(1 \times 6 = 6\) petals.
- 1 flower with 4 petals, which is \(1 \times 4 = 4\) petals.
- 1 flower with 7 petals, which is \(1 \times 7 = 7\) petals.

The total number of petals dropped is:
\[5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\text{ petals}\]

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total gives:
\[101 - 22 = 79\text{ petals}\]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step with a fresh perspective.

Initially, there are 35 marshmallows in the bag. John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, which totals 18 marshmallows used. Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21. This leaves us with 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows.

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, and there are 14 marshmallows left, each of them can have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.

Therefore, the number of S'mores each can have with the remaining marshmallows is 7.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem again with a fresh perspective.

Jack and his three friends are playing a game where each quarter allows them to play for 20 minutes. Two of his friends can only play for half the time Jack can, which is 10 minutes each. The third friend, who is significantly better, can play for 1.5 times the time Jack can, which is 30 minutes.

They play a total of 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. We need to calculate how many quarters they use to play for 240 minutes.

- Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter.
- Each of the two worse friends plays for 10 minutes per quarter.
- The better friend plays for 30 minutes per quarter.

First, let's calculate the total time played by each person:
- Jack plays for \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \) quarters.
- Each of the two worse friends plays for \( \frac{240}{10} = 24 \) quarters.
- The better friend plays for \( \frac{240}{30} = 8 \) quarters.

Adding these together, the total number of quarters used is \( 12 + 24 + 8 = 44 \) quarters.

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 44 quarters. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{44}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much oil Tanya uses.

Given the relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can substitute \( C \) with \( S \) and \( F \) with \( S \). Therefore, we have:
- \( O = 2S \)
- \( F = S \)
- \( C = S \)
- \( G = S \)

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation, we get:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil used, which is \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil used is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}
\]"
"Sure, let me calculate this again as if it's the first time.

John buys 3 goats at $500 each and 2 cows at $1500 each. To find out how much money he spent, we calculate the total cost for the goats and the cows separately and then add them together.

For the goats:
- Number of goats: 3
- Cost per goat: $500
- Total cost for goats: \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars

For the cows:
- Number of cows: 2
- Cost per cow: $1500
- Total cost for cows: \(2 \times 1500 = 3000\) dollars

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the cows:
- Total cost: \(1500 + 3000 = 4500\) dollars

So, the total amount of money John spent is $4500."
"Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, which makes a total of 48 cupcakes. Since he needs 63 cupcakes for the party, he should buy:

"Sure, let's break it down again from the start with a fresh perspective.

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe initially has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe initially has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars, so he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars left.
   - He gives away 16 cars, so he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars left.

Thus, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is 16.

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

The total amount raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of this comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

There are 20 students, and the total amount raised by the students is $125,000. So, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6250 \]"
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step, keeping in mind the persona of Fatima.

Sandy walked from Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, which means she walked for \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since the question asks for the total time in minutes, we convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes. 

If this were a multiple-choice question, the correct answer would be:

A) 720 minutes

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"

"Sure, let's break it down again from the start to ensure clarity.

John does 30 cycles of work a day. Each cycle has 5 different tasks, and each task pays $1.20. To find out how much he makes in a full 7-day week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tasks John completes in one day:**
   - John does 30 cycles a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - Therefore, the total number of tasks he completes in one day is:
     \[
     30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of money John earns in one day:**
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he earns in one day is:
     \[
     150 \text{ tasks/day} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$180/\text{day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of money John earns in a full 7-day week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money he earns in a 7-day week is:
     \[
     \$180/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$1260

   - Sasha's points in the second game: 4 points.
   - Total points for Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\) points.

The total points Sasha scored during both games is 18."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

Next, Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step as Fatima would.

We have three people: Becca, Smendrick, and PJ. The total number of cards is 341. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, and Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has.

Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). Then Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards, and Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards can be expressed as:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3 \times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Cindy went to the Easter Egg Hunt and collected eggs. Here’s how we can count them:

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so that’s \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so that’s \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that’s \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The cost per pound is $0.35.
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - Therefore, the cost for the weight of the book is \(4 \times 0.35 = 1.40\) dollars.
   - The cost per mile is $0.08.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - Therefore, the cost for the distance is \(20 \times 0.08 = 1.60\) dollars.
   - The total shipping cost is \(1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the refundable portion of the book's purchase price:**
   - The book cost $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - Therefore, the refundable amount is \(32 \times 0.75 = 24.00\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The total cost to Milly is the shipping cost plus the cost of the book.
   - The cost of the book is $32.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(32 + 3.00 = 35.00\) dollars.
   - The net loss is the total cost minus the refundable amount.
   - Therefore, the net loss is \(35.00 - 24.00 = 11.00\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. We know the production for the first three weeks:

- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: Half of the first week, which is 4,000 bars
- Third week: Three times the first week, which is 24,000 bars

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in total each month, the production for the fourth week would be:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, the number of bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is 14,000. 

If this were a multiple-choice question, the correct answer would be:

"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the detailed breakdown:

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 TikTok videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos per week is:
     \[
     18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, the time spent writing songs per week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Therefore, the time spent on makeup per week is:
     \[
     15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

4. **Total time spent on TikTok-related activities per week:**
   - Adding up the time spent on TikTok videos, writing songs, and makeup:
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} + 120 \text{ minutes/week} + 90 \text{ minutes/week} = 282 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

5. **Total time spent on TikTok-related activities in a month (4 weeks):**
   - Since there are 4 weeks in the month, the total time spent is:
     \[
     282 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Converting the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, the total time in hours is:
     \[
     \frac{1128 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 18.8 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is \(\boxed{18.8 \text{ hours}}\)."
"Sure, let's break down the costs for Angela again in a clear manner.

The base cost for the installation, which includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures, is $129.00. 

Now, Angela needs additional items:
- 6 mirrors (which means 2 more mirrors than the base)
- 2 chandeliers (which means 1 more chandelier than the base)
- 20 pictures (which means 10 more pictures than the base)

The cost to install each additional item is $15.00.

Let's calculate the additional costs:
- For the additional mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
- For the additional chandeliers: \(1 \times 15 = 15\)
- For the additional pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\)

Adding these up gives the total additional cost:
\[30 + 15 + 150 = 195\]

Now, we add this to the base cost:
\[129 + 195 = 324\]

Therefore, the total cost for Angela is \(\boxed{324}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with the persona of Fatima.

First, we know Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so:
\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings:
\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this to Anthony's savings gives Roy's total savings:
\[
\text{Roy's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

So, the final amount of money Roy has is $42.00."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, to convert 480 inches to feet, we know that 1 foot equals 12 inches. So:
\[
480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the height Naruto can lift a mountain is 40 feet. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again for clarity.

Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour. For the first part of his journey, he travels for 4 hours. The distance he covers in the first part is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, he takes a rest and then continues for another 6 hours. The distance he covers in the second part is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the total distance traveled, we add the distances from both parts of the journey:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"Certainly, let's break it down again from the beginning.

If it takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway, we need to determine how long it will take for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to do the same journey.

1. **Total Distance Calculation:**
   - Let the distance across the highway be \( D \).
   - Each kangaroo travels at speed \( v \), so the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
     \]

2. **Speed of Each Turtle:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Time Calculation for Four Turtles:**
   - Let \( t \) be the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed in terms of the speed of the turtles and the time \( t \):
     \[
     D = 4 \left( \frac{v}{2} \right) t = 2vt
     \]
   - Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
     \[
     54v = 2vt
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again with a fresh perspective.

1. **Kora's Clay Dishes**: Kora made 20 clay dishes.
   \[
   K = 20
   \]

2. **Rory's Clay Dishes**: Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora.
   \[
   R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Jada's Clay Dishes**: Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory.
   \[
   J = 2 \times R = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Total Clay Dishes**: To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we sum their individual counts.
   \[
   \text{Total} = J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140
   \]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"Sure, let's break it down again from the beginning to ensure clarity.

Erika wants a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200, making the new price $400. She needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, meaning she currently has $350.

Erika has received $150 from her part-time job and $80 from her mom, which totals $230. To find out how much money she has in her purse, we subtract the $230 she received from her other sources from the $350 she needs in total.

So, the amount in her purse is:
\[ 350 - 230 = 120 \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Adam starts by slicing 3 large apples. Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so from the large apples, he gets:

\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, he slices 5 small apples. Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so from the small apples, he gets:

\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding these together, the total number of slices Adam has is:

\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices he eats from the total number of slices:

\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of apple slices left is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows currently:
\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

2. Determine the additional amount of milk needed to reach 25 liters:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

3. Calculate how many more cows are required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk a day:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The correct answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used.

1. **First glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \( \frac{1}{6} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{5}{6} \times 12 = 10 \) millimeters

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) millimeters

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) millimeters

Now, we sum the remaining lengths of the three glue sticks:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \( 20 \) millimeters.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. He has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. To find out how much more money he needs, I'll add the money he has to the cost of the car and the phone.

The total cost is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

The total amount of money Gabriel has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.

So, the amount of money he still needs is $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

The final numerical answer is $5600."
"While on vacation in Bali, Thea bought a hat from a craftsman worth $70. She gave the craftsman four $20 bills. To find out how much change she received, I'll calculate it step by step.

The total amount Thea gave is:
4 * $20 = $80

The cost of the hat is $70, so the change she got is:
$80 - $70 = $10

Therefore, the change Thea received is $10."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which totals to:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys six squirt guns at $2 each, so the cost is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys three packs of water balloons at $3 each, so the cost is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the costs of the squirt guns and water balloons gives:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the total cost from the initial amount of money Craig has:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Craig has left is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a fresh perspective.

Given:
- Jack has 60 dishes.
- Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so \( D = 2S \). Substituting \( D = 60 \), we get \( 60 = 2S \), which means \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items they have together:
- Jack has \( 30 \) socks and \( 60 \) dishes, so Jack has \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) items.
- Peter has \( 60 \) socks and \( 30 \) dishes, so Peter has \( 60 + 30 = 90 \) items.
- Together, they have \( 90 + 90 = 180 \) items.

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 180 \)."
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step to find out how many students are good at math.

We know the total number of students in Miss Susan's class is 20. 

- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.

To find out how many students are good at both math and English, we subtract the sum of students who are good at math only and those who perform well in English only from the total number of students:

\[ 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

To find the total number of students good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both math and English:

\[ 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12.

The final answer is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start.

Vicki is planning a pop concert at her high school, and the show will be 2 hours long. Each group will have a total performance time of 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. Additionally, there will be a 10-minute intermission.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes per group} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

We now need to determine how many groups can fit into the remaining 110 minutes:
\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years with a simple interest scheme, we start by calculating the simple interest. The formula for simple interest is:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%\)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

Let's compute this:
\[ 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]
\[ 675 \times 3 = 2025 \]

So, the simple interest earned over 3 years is $2025.

Next, we add the simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

We start with the total number of white shirts and floral shirts:
- White shirts: 40
- Floral shirts: 50

Next, we calculate the number of white shirts with collars and without collars:
- White shirts with collars: 40 / 2 = 20
- White shirts without collars: 40 - 20 = 20

Then, we determine the number of floral shirts with buttons and without buttons:
- Floral shirts with buttons: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 50 - 20 = 30

Finally, we find the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and white shirts without collars:
- Floral shirts without buttons: 30
- White shirts without collars: 20

The difference is:
30 - 20 = 10

So, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts without collars. The final answer is 10."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

\[
\frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Now, if each tray is sold for $2.5, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the trays.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Mr. Smith starts with 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sells 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many from Farm Y, which means he sells 20 goats from Farm Y.

First, we calculate the remaining goats in each farm:
- In Farm X, the remaining goats are \(55 - 10 = 45\).
- In Farm Y, the remaining goats are \(45 - 20 = 25\).

Now, we add the remaining goats from both farms to find the total:
\[45 + 25 = 70\]

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of 3 baskets of green food:**
   Each basket of green food costs $25.
   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 baskets of green food} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:**
   Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket.
   \[
   \text{Discount per basket of red food} = 2 \text{ dollars}

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

1. **First Year:**
   The town builds 12 homes.
   \[
   \text{Homes built in the first year} = 12
   \]

2. **Second Year:**
   The town builds three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Homes built in the second year} = 3 \times 12 = 36

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how old I am.

1. I am three years younger than my brother, so if my brother is \( B \) years old, then I am \( B - 3 \) years old.
2. I am two years older than my sister, so if my sister is \( S \) years old, then I am \( S + 2 \) years old.
3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom is \( 3B - 1 \) years old.
4. The sum of all our ages is 87, so \( (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \).

Let's simplify the equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]
\[ 6B = 96 \]
\[ B = 16 \]

So, my brother is 16 years old. Since I am three years younger than my brother, I am:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, I am 13 years old."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy.

First, we calculate the total number of glue sticks required:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to determine how many packs of glue sticks are required. Since glue sticks come in packs of 8, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of sticks per pack:
\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to have enough glue sticks, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

So, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Certainly! Let's break it down again:

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   - On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.

2. **Amount of Water on the Second Day:**
   - After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles.
   - Therefore, on the second day, the amount of water is \( 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \) gallons.

3. **Amount of Water on the Third Day:**
   - On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons.
   - Therefore, on the third day, the amount of water is \( 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \) gallons.

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons.

The final numerical answer is:

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people are infected after three days.

Initially, there are 10 people infected. Each day, every infected person infects 6 others. So, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total number of infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Now, there are 70 infected people.
- Each of these 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total number of infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Now, there are 490 infected people.
- Each of these 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total number of infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Therefore, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Rafaela received $20 from each of the 40 customers, so her total tips are:

\[
40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela. First, we calculate 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[
10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Julieta's total tips are:

\[
800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together gives us the total amount of tips they received:

\[
800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of tips they received altogether is:

\[
\boxed{1520}

"Sure, let me calculate this again with a fresh perspective.

Jennifer started with 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges. Her son received 3 oranges. So, the total number of oranges given away is \(6 + 3 = 9\).

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:

\[12 - 9 = 3\]

Therefore, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges. The correct answer is 3."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year.

1. **Claire's Badges:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges in a year.

2. **Amber's Badges:**
   - It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Since Claire earns a badge every month, Amber earns a badge every 2 months.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges in a year.

3. **Wendy's Badges:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges in a year.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber is \(36 - 6 = 30\).

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"Sure, let me break it down for you in a way that feels more natural to me.

Paige bakes banana bread from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is a total of 5 hours. Since she can bake 2 loaves of banana bread every hour, over 5 hours she bakes:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so the total revenue from selling all the slices is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Paige raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

If Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can find the number of silver coins by subtracting 30 from the number of gold coins. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of silver coins} = 70 - 30 = 40 \]

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins together:

\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step with a fresh perspective.

First, we need to determine the total number of burritos distributed to the students. There are 50 students, and each student gets 10 burritos:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we account for the burritos Mr. George ate. He ate 20 burritos:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 480 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George from the total number of burritos ordered:
\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 480 \text{ burritos} = 120 \text{ burritos} \]

Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to find the number of yellow cars.

1. **Red Cars:** The rink has 12 red cars.
2. **Green Cars:** They have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10 \text{ green cars}
   \]
3. **Blue Cars:** They have 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars, so:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ blue cars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the red, green, and blue cars:
\[
12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \text{ cars}
\]

Since the total number of cars in the rink is 75, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
75 - 52 = 23 \text{ yellow cars}
\]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that together Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is:

\[
(A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
3A + 37 = 85
\]

Subtract 37 from both sides:

\[
3A = 48
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
A = 16
\]

So, Anne has 16 books. Now, to find out how many books Fawn has, we add 12 to the number of books Anne has:

\[
A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28
\]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{28}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Daisy bought potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. The sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, so the sweet potatoes weigh:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The carrots weigh 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weigh:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots. 

The final answer is:

"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many jello cups Greg needs to make. Since there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many boxes of jello are needed. Since one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, the number of boxes required is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Greg will spend on jello is:

"Certainly! Let's break it down step by step to find out how much Keenan spends per week.

First, we know that Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 per month. Madeline pays 60% of this amount, so we calculate her monthly payment as follows:

\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Keenan's monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4 to find out how much he spends per week:

\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Keenan spends per week is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem again with a fresh perspective.

Tobias started with 60 pieces of pizza. On the first day, he ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the pieces:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
\]
So, after the first day, he had:
\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]
On the second day, he ate 10 pieces:
\[
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
\]
On the third day, he ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining pieces:

"Sure, let's break it down again for clarity.

For the soda:
- Seven bottles cost $21.00, so one bottle costs $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

For the water:
- Four bottles cost $8.00, so one bottle costs $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Now, for David's purchase:
- He wants 3 bottles of soda, so the cost is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
- He also wants 2 bottles of water, so the cost is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Adding these together, the total cost is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

So, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."

David starts with $12.48. Each bolt costs $0.03, and he wants to buy 16 bolts. First, we calculate the total cost of the bolts:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48
\]

Now, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has:

\[
\text{Money left} = 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00
\]

So, after buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left.

"To determine how much money Isaias bought the chickens for, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Isaias plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens. So, the number of chickens he plans to sell is:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

2. If he sells these 180 chickens at $50 each, the total revenue from selling them is:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

3. Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. Therefore, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. Let's denote the number of glasses sold by Micah as \( M \).

So, we have:
\[ 14 + M + M = 32 \]
\[ 14 + 2M = 32 \]

Subtract 14 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 9 \]

Micah sold 9 glasses. Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Sarah has a 20-meter rope that she sells for $2 per meter. So, the total revenue from selling the rope is:

\[
20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

With this $40, Sarah plans to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide the total money by the cost per meter:

\[
\frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since she can only buy whole meters, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[
26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

The money left over after buying the new rope is:

\[
40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Melanie's age in 10 years will be 18. This means her current age is:
\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]
So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. If her current age is 8, then three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

To find out when her age will be 24, we calculate the difference between her age at 24 and her current age:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly has:

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}

Now, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know that the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts and includes a 15-minute encore. So, if we let the usual concert length be \( x \) minutes, then the final concert length is \( 2x \) minutes. Adding the 15-minute encore to the final concert length gives us:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Argo initially had 200 toys. He gave 40 to Alyssa, 80 to Bonnie, and 30 to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has left, I subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys.

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Mark makes $480 a week. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 480 \]"
"Given the information, let's break it down step by step. Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she mowed Joe's lawn once and was paid $6 for that. 

From the problem, we also know:
- In the first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn three times as many times as she did Joe's lawn, which means she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times.
- In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's lawn, which means she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times.

So, the total number of times she mowed lawns is:
\[ 1 \text{ (Joe's lawn)} + 3 \text{ (Kamala's lawn)} + 5 \text{ (Alba's lawn)} = 9 \text{ times} \]

Since she was paid $6 for mowing Joe's lawn, and she mowed lawns 9 times in total, the total payment from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \text{ dollars} \]

Given that her total earnings were $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight:
   \[ 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:
   \[ 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:
   \[ 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 74 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again with a fresh perspective.

First, we determine the total number of hours John rents his car out in a month:
\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from renting the car:
\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750/\text{month} \]

Then, we find the profit by subtracting the monthly car payment from the total earnings:
\[ \$750/\text{month} - \$500/\text{month} = \$250/\text{month} \]

So, the profit John makes on his car is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer persona.

Martha originally had some number of notebooks, let's call that number \( M \). Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, so he had \( 3M \) notebooks.

Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, and her total became 7 notebooks. So, we can write:
\[ M + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Therefore, Joseph had:
\[ 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ notebooks} \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we calculate:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Certainly! Let's break it down step by step:

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed an additional \( \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \) miles. Therefore, Anis rowed a total of \( 50 + 10 = 60 \) miles.

To find the total distance both rowed, we add Dijana's and Anis's distances together:
\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{110}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

1. Susan made 100 cookies.
2. Her husband took 4 cookies, so we subtract those: \(100 - 4 = 96\) cookies remain.
3. She has 6 nephews, and we need to divide the 96 cookies equally among them.

To find out how many cookies each nephew gets, we divide 96 by 6:
\[
96 \div 6 = 16
\]

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.

The final numerical answer is:

1. **Pages read by Denise and Daniel yesterday:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read by Denise today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday.
   - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.
   - Therefore, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

3. **Pages read by Daniel today:**
   - Daniel was not able to read any pages today.
   - Therefore, Daniel read 0 pages today.

4. **Total pages read by Denise:**
   - Yesterday: 10 pages
   - Today: 18 pages
   - Total pages read by Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

5. **Total pages read by Daniel:**
   - Yesterday: 13 pages
   - Today: 0 pages
   - Total pages read by Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

6. **Difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel:**
   - Denise read 28 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.
   - Difference: \(28 - 13 = 15\) pages.

"Sure, let's break it down again from the start with a fresh perspective.

Calvin is making soup for his family, and the pot can fill four adult bowls or eight child's bowls. Calvin is an adult, and he will be eating with his adult wife and their two children. If everyone eats one bowl at a meal, we need to figure out how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup.

1. **Total Soup Capacity**: The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. Since Calvin is an adult, the total soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls.
2. **Total Bowls Needed**: Calvin (1 adult) + Calvin's wife (1 adult) + 2 children (2 children) = 4 bowls in total.
3. **Bowls Served**: Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls and there are 4 bowls needed, all 4 bowls can be served.
4. **Leftover Bowls**: After serving the family, there are no bowls left over.

Given that there are no bowls left over, each child can have a bowl of soup only once.

Therefore, the number of times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup is **0 times**.

"Sure, let's break it down again for clarity.

William bought five notebooks, and each notebook costs $1.50. So, the total cost for the notebooks is:

\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

Next, William bought one ballpen, and each ballpen costs $0.50. So, the cost for the ballpen is:

\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Now, to find the total amount William spent, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together:

\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, William spent a total of $8.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

To find out how much material Jo needs for 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Material for one small mask:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for one small mask is:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
     \]

2. **Material for one large mask:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - Therefore, the material needed for one large mask is:
     \[
     \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
     \]

Next, we calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

3. **Total material for 20 small masks:**
   - Material per small mask: 0.5 yards
   - Total material for 20 small masks:
     \[
     20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

4. **Total material for 8 large masks:**
   - Material per large mask: 0.75 yards
   - Total material for 8 large masks:
     \[
     8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

Finally, we sum the material needed for both types of masks to find the total material required.

5. **Total material needed:**
   \[
   10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
   \]

So, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies three times, which totals to 27 movie tickets. She spent $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27} \]

Performing the division:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"Sure, let me calculate Harold's free time again as if this is the first time I'm doing it.

Harold spends 10 hours sleeping each night. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for:
\[ 10 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

He also walks his dog for 1 hour each day. To find out how much free time he has left, we need to subtract the total time spent on these activities from the total hours in a day, which is 24 hours.

So, the total time spent on activities is:
\[ 10 \text{ hours (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ hours (working)} + 1 \text{ hour (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Subtracting this from the total hours in a day gives us:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Next, he uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes. The number of red shoe boxes used is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

Adding the remaining blue and red shoe boxes together, we get:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a focus on clarity and precision.

Given:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52 \).
- Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
- According to the problem, eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago, so \( 52 = 2(A - 4) \).

Now, let's solve for Adam's current age \( A \):
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 38 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. So, we first calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:

\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Then, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms combined, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the total number of acres for both farms together is 700 acres."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. If he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we first calculate how many packages he completes per hour:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Since he earns $0.20 for each package, we calculate his total earnings for the day:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is $64. 

So, the final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

John drinks one bottle of water every half-hour. A normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 180 minutes.

To find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30 (since 30 minutes is a half-hour):

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since John drinks one bottle of water every half-hour, in 180 minutes, he drinks 6 bottles of water.

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58, and there are 20 red balloons.

First, calculate the total number of pieces of bologna used for the red balloons:
\[ 2 \text{ pieces/bologna} \times 20 \text{ red balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, subtract the pieces used for the red balloons from the total to find out how many pieces were used for the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow} \]

Since each yellow balloon requires 3 pieces of bologna, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the pieces used for yellow balloons by 3:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces/bologna}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon needs in that time is:

- On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
- On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, so that's \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Adding these up: \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\) hours.

So, the total number of hours Bruce works in these three days is 23."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them.

First, we calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
- The cake costs $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
- They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[ \text{Amount each received} = \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ students}
   \]

Adding the students playing tennis and volleyball together:
\[
6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} = 18 \text{ students}

Next, we look at the students playing soccer:
- There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is:
\[
16 + 22 = 38 \text{ students}
\]

Since each student is only participating in one group, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer to find the total number of students:
\[
18 \text{ (tennis and volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56 \text{ students}
\]

Therefore, the total number of students is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students, so the total number of lollipops sold is:
\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue from selling these lollipops is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost of buying these lollipops is:
\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit from selling the lollipops is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Sure, let me break it down again in a way that feels more natural to me.

Larry starts with 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs. Next, he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits. The fish tank has three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish. Lastly, he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add them all up: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets in total.

So, the total number of pets Larry has is 47."

"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start.

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She uses 15 of these cups to brew cinnamon tea, leaving her with:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
cups for chamomile and mint tea. Since she divides these 12 cups equally between chamomile and mint tea, she brews:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
cups of each type of tea.

Now, she divides these 27 cups into 3 rows equally. So, each row contains:
\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]
cups of tea. Since the cups in each row are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, each row contains:
\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]
cups of mint tea.

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

The sloth takes 4 hours to make a round trip (down to the ground and back up to the tree). In 8 hours, the sloth can make 2 trips because:

\[
\frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he makes 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

So, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 12. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the pool has 10000 gallons of water. The tank is filled with half of that amount, so the tank gets:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. Over 6 days, the total amount of water removed from the tank is:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ 2000 \text{ gallons} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step with a fresh perspective.

Colby has a monthly budget of $150 to spend on movies. He wants to buy a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) on the last day of the month, which is a Friday. This means he will spend $10 on these items.

First, we subtract the cost of the popcorn and candy from his total budget:
\[ 150 - 10 = 140 \]

Now, Colby has $140 left to spend on movie tickets. Since it's a Friday, he can only see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday. Each ticket costs $10, so he can see one more movie with the remaining $10.

Therefore, the number of additional movies he can see is 1.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a focus on the mini pastries.

First, we calculate the calories for the mini cinnamon rolls. Since a mini cinnamon roll has one-third the calories of a normal cinnamon roll, and a normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, a mini cinnamon roll has:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories for the mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Now, for the mini blueberry muffins, we do the same calculation. Since a mini blueberry muffin has one-third the calories of a normal blueberry muffin, and a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, a mini blueberry muffin has:
\[ \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Then, we calculate the total calories for the mini blueberry muffins:
\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries to find the overall total calories:
\[ 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[ \boxed{85000} \]"

- On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum these numbers:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Adding these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

Next, to find the average number of Junebugs removed per day, we divide the total by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the distance traveled by the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance traveled by the car from the distance traveled by the bus:
\[ \text{Difference} = 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"Sure, let me clarify this for you in a more conversational manner.

Sophie had a collection of toys before buying the bouncy balls. She had 31 building blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 stacking rings. That makes a total of 48 toys. Now, she has a total of 62 toys for her nephew. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the age of Peter.

Given:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Let's denote:
- Peter's age as \( P \)
- Paul's age as \( Pa \)
- Jean's age as \( J \)

From the information given:
1. \( P + Pa + J = 100 \)
2. \( Pa = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = Pa + J \)

Using the second equation, we can substitute \( Pa \) in the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years old."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's:
\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Maria herself had 1 water balloon. So, the total number of balloons before her mom gave more is:
\[ 8 \text{ balloons} + 1 \text{ balloon} = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Her mom then gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Adding the initial total to the additional balloons gives:
\[ 9 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale:

- Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes of stuff: \(10 \times 5 = 50\) boxes.
- They also have 10 boxes of stuff already: \(10\) boxes.
- Adding these together gives the total number of boxes: \(50 + 10 = 60\) boxes.

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff:

- Calculate the number of tables needed: \(\frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}\).

They already own 15 tables:

- Calculate the number of new tables needed: \(30 - 15 = 15 \text{ new tables}\).

So, the number of new tables they need is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as if this is the first time I'm answering the question.

First, we calculate the total distance Zoey spits her seeds:
- Zoey has 40 seeds.
- Each seed is spit 10 feet.
- Total distance Zoey spits: \( 40 \times 10 = 400 \) feet.

Next, we calculate the total distance Sydney spits her seeds:
- Sydney has 35 seeds.
- Each seed is spit 12 feet.
- Total distance Sydney spits: \( 35 \times 12 = 420 \) feet.

Now, we find the sum of the total distances spat by both:
- Total distance spat by Zoey: 400 feet.
- Total distance spat by Sydney: 420 feet.
- Sum of total distances: \( 400 + 420 = 820 \) feet.

Finally, we find the average total distance:
- Average total distance: \( \frac{820}{2} = 410 \) feet.

So, the average total distance spat is \(\boxed{410}\) feet."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as if this is the first time I'm tackling it.

First, we need to calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour, and it runs 24 hours a day, so it makes \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets per day.
- WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, and it also runs 24 hours a day, so it makes \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets per day.

Next, we calculate the monthly widget production:
- For the Widgeteer 3000, it makes \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) widgets in a month.
- For the WidgetMaster 9000, it makes \(1080 \times 30 = 32400\) widgets in a month.

Now, we calculate the revenue from selling the widgets:
- The Widgeteer 3000 generates \(43200 \times 6 = \$259200\) in revenue.
- The WidgetMaster 9000 generates \(32400 \times 6 = \$194400\) in revenue.

Finally, we find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[
\$259200 - \$194400 = \$64800
\]

So, Fern will make \$64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much Cameron would save, let's break down the costs for both options:

1. **24-Hour Option**: This option costs 1600 pesos for a full 24-hour stay.

2. **12-Hour Plus Additional Hours Option**: 
   - The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
   - Cameron stays for an additional 5 hours after the first 12 hours, and each additional hour costs 70 pesos. So, the cost for these 5 additional hours is 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, to find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option from the cost of the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

So, Cameron would save **250 pesos**."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

John earns $50 per hour and works for 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

After spending $50 on gas, he has:
\[ 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

He wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so he has:
\[ 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, he buys 5 pencils at $10 each, so the cost is:
\[ 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, he has:
\[ 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, he wants to buy pens that cost $25 each. With $100, he can buy:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step as Fatima would.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, which is 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar. Let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). Therefore, Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points, and Dinar scored \( A + 10 \) points.

The total points scored by all three is 45. So, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Now, let's solve for \( A \):
\[ 3A + 30 - 30 = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The correct answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, he worked for 16 hours. Converting 16 hours into minutes gives us 960 minutes. Now, to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 960 minutes, we divide 960 by 15, which equals 64 intervals. Since he staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply 64 intervals by 30 reports/interval to get the total number of reports stapled.

So, the total number of reports he stapled is 64 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1920 reports.

Therefore, the final answer is 1920 reports."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Initially, the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of these beds are occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds}
\]

This means the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds}

50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients}
\]

Adding these 700 patients to the initial 200 occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds}
\]

Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[
1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ beds}
\]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[

"Sure, let's break it down step by step with the persona of Fatima.

Given that Jason carried 2 balls, we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

Adding these up, the total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again from the beginning to ensure clarity.

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: They dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: They dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net increase is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

By the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

Now, by the end of the third day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the number of holes by the end of the third day should be:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Sure, let me clarify this for you in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than either of them. So, Collins got 85 corn chips. To find the total number of corn chips, we add the chips each person got:

\[ 70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is 225. 

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"Sure, let me clarify the cost of travel for Jen. The supplies cost $400 in total. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. 

To find the cost of the travel tickets, we calculate 50% of $400, which is $200. Adding this to the cost of the supplies gives us $400 + $200 = $600.

So, the total cost of the travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step as Fatima would.

Given:
- Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught a total of 339 Pokemon.
- Alex has caught 5 more than Stan.
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's denote:
- The number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught as \( A \).
- The number of Pokemon Stan has caught as \( S \).
- The number of Pokemon Alex has caught as \( X \).

From the problem, we have:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the total equation:

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplifying:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now, find \( S \):

\[
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, find \( X \):

\[
X = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Checking the total:

\[
X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

So, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, if \( M \) is the number of minutes per episode, then \( E \) (the number of episodes) is \( \frac{M}{2} \).

Given \( M = 20 \) minutes, we can calculate \( E \) as follows:
\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time John will spend watching the show is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes."
"Certainly, let's break down the journey of the bird step by step to find the total distance between her northern and southern homes.

1. **First Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **446 miles**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office, she received half a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Adding these up gives:
\[
12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies}
\]

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Converting this to individual brownies:
\[
1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
\]

Subtracting the eaten brownies from the total:
\[
66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies}
\]

So, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister.

Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, let's calculate the total age of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

So, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 30 \]"

   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time for polyester string: \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time for hybrid sets: \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes

Now, I'll add up the times:
\[45 + 110 + 72 = 227\] minutes

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

2. **Second Phone:** $600
3. **Third Phone:** $600 / 2 = $300
4. **Fourth Phone:** $600 / 2 = $300

Now, let's add up the costs:

\[
600 + 600 + 300 + 300 = 1800

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, we calculate the number of players on Zeke's team as follows:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = 13 + 20 = 33 \]

So, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33. 

The correct answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the length is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Now, since Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing, we multiply the perimeter by 2 to find the total number of wooden slats required:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

So, the total number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Mrs. Harrington initially had 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals to 4 boxes given away. Therefore, the number of boxes she kept is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

She kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the oranges, so the number of boxes she kept is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ boxes} = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means the number of boxes she sold is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 9 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:

\[ 9 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 180 \text{ oranges} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 180 \]"
"Given the problem, let's break it down step by step. If we denote the number of states in the USA as \( S \), then the number of states in India is \( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \).

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA to the number of states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \left( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \right) \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{2S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3S}{2} + 4 \]

Without a specific number for \( S \), we can't provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume the USA has 50 states, then:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{150}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 75 + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 79 \]

So, if the USA has 50 states, the total number of states in both countries together is 79. 

Given the options, the correct answer would be:

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to earn is:

\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25 is:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books. The final numerical answer is:

5"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

We have 60 cherries in total. Robert has 30 cherries, which is 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries. To find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the cherries Richard and Robert have from the total: \(60 - 30 - 20 = 10\) cherries for Jerry.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number Robert has: \(30 - 10 = 20\).

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

**Total boxes sold:**
- Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Apple pie: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

**Earnings calculation:**
- Gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 per box = $150
- Apple pie: 21 boxes * $15 per box = $315

**Total earnings:**

To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside over 8 days.
2. Determine the total amount of sunscreen she will need.
3. Calculate how many 8-ounce bottles are required to cover the total amount of sunscreen needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside.**

Pamela spends 4 hours outside each day for 8 days:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of sunscreen she will need.**

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour. Therefore, for 32 hours:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many 8-ounce bottles are required.**

Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen. To find out how many bottles are needed for 32 ounces:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final numerical answer is:

"The price of the blue car is $100. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we first calculate 40% of $100:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40 \]

So, the red car costs:

\[ \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car:

\[ \$100 + \$60 = \$160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, that means in 5 years, he will be 24 years old. At that time, he will be half the age of his dad, so his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old. This means his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.

Also, at that time, Emil will be twice the age of his brother, so his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old. This means his brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.

Now, to find the sum of the current ages of his dad and his brother, we add their current ages together:
\[43 + 7 = 50\]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Sure, let me calculate this again with a fresh perspective.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which means the sister gave \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so the friend gave \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, to find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads from each source:

\[
20 \text{ (from mother)} + 30 \text{ (from sister)} + 40 \text{ (from friend)} = 90
\]

So, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads. 

The final answer is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these amounts together gives us the total:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find out how many servings of 3 pounds each he has, we divide the total by 3:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate the number of football players. Since 20% of the 30 students are football players:

\[ 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players. This leaves us with:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

students who are not football players.

Next, we find out how many of these 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Adding the football players to these students gives us the total number of students leaving early:

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long. Each flower plant is 1 foot wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Pat already has 17 plants.

First, we need to figure out how many additional plants Pat needs. The total space required for the plants and the spaces between them can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total space required} = \text{Number of plants} \times \text{Width of each plant} + (\text{Number of spaces between plants} \times \text{Space between each plant}) \]

Given that the flower bed is 111 feet long, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of plants} \times 1 + (\text{Number of plants} - 1) \times 1.5 = 111 \]

Let's denote the number of plants Pat needs as \( n \). Then we have:

\[ n + 1.5(n - 1) = 111 \]
\[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n = 112.5 \]
\[ n = \frac{112.5}{2.5} \]
\[ n = 45 \]

So, Pat needs 45 plants in total. Since she already has 17 plants, she needs to buy:

\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost is:

\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"

First, let's calculate how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day:
- Edgar's brother eats \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \) pretzels a day.

Next, to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
- So, \( 9 \times 7 = 63 \) pretzels in a week.

Therefore, the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week is 63.

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as if I'm Fatima.

Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill. In each basket, she wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3.00 each, and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each. We need to find out how much she will spend in total.

First, let's calculate the cost for one basket:
- Cost of petunias in one basket: \(3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00\)
- Cost of sweet potato vines in one basket: \(2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00\)

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[
\$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00
\]

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost for all 5 baskets is:
\[
5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is:

\[ 3 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 18 \text{ pounds} \]

This leaves them with:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 18 \text{ pounds} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant with the remaining 12 pounds is:
\[ 12 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we first calculate how much she sets aside each month for shoes:

\[
\text{Amount set aside per month} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500
\]

Next, we calculate how much she can spend on shoes in a year:

\[
\text{Amount set aside per year} = 500 \times 12 = 6000
\]

Now, we determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with $6,000 if each pair costs $1,000:

\[
\text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6
\]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, Emily can peel 6 shrimp in a minute. To peel 90 shrimp, we calculate the time as follows:

\[
\text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To sauté 90 shrimp, we need to find out how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:

\[
\text{Number of sets} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set takes 10 minutes, the total time to sauté 90 shrimp is:

\[
\text{Total time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Adding the time to peel and the time to sauté gives us the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is 45 minutes. The correct answer is:

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: 6 degrees.
- Cooling on high: 12 degrees.
- Warming up: 4 degrees.

Net change in temperature:
\[ 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the room warms up by 14 degrees, it is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature. Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time.

1. Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet the second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it. So, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
3. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the second sighting was 75 years after the first one. Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the information again to find out how many checks Buford writes per year.

- Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so that's 12 checks.
- He also writes a check for the gas bill once per month, which adds another 12 checks.
- He writes a check to the church twice per month, so that's 2 checks per month. Over 12 months, that's \(2 \times 12 = 24\) checks.
- He writes a check to the pest and lawn service quarterly, which means 4 checks per year.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Electric bill checks: 12
- Gas bill checks: 12
- Church checks: 24
- Pest and lawn service checks: 4

Total checks per year: \(12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52\)

So, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is 52."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer focus on the numbers provided.

We know the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the first plane makes:

\[ 2 \times 44 = 88 \text{ trips in a day} \]

Given that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the number of flights to France is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we have Tobias's howl which lasts 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as the combined howls of Tobias and Chikote, so:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we add up the total time for all three wolves:
\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert this into minutes, we know that 60 seconds make a minute, so:
\[ 120 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Adam spent $30 on new trousers. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice that amount, which is $12. So, the total amount of money given by his parents is $6 + $12 = $18.

Since Adam spent $30 on the trousers, the amount he had to contribute from his savings is $30 - $18 = $12.

Therefore, the amount Adam had to contribute from his savings is $12.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find Wilfred's age.

1. **Total age of the children:** The total age of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred is 20 years.
2. **Given ages:** Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old.
3. **Set up the equation for the total age:** 
   \[
   3 + 4 + H + W = 20
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   7 + H + W = 20
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   H + W = 13
   \]
4. **Helene's age:** Helene is twice the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   So, Helene's age \( H \) is:
   \[
   H = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
5. **Substitute Helene's age into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):**
   \[
   10 + W = 13
   \]
   Solving for \( W \):
   \[
   W = 13 - 10 = 3
   \]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

First, we calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we add the $200 given by Walter's friend to the total collected so far:

- Total collected so far: $2000
- Amount given by Walter's friend: $200

Total amount donated by everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Now, we calculate the lawyer's donation, which is three times the amount donated by everyone else:

- Amount donated by everyone else: $2200
- Lawyer's donation: 3 * $2200 = $6600

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6600}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

There were 100 guests at the wedding, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of these cookies to the church next door. Therefore, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets.

Given:
- There are 2 adults and 4 kids.
- Each adult's slice is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's denote the volume of each kid's slice as \( x \). Therefore, the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

The total volume of the watermelon can be calculated as follows:
- Volume of 4 kids' slices: \( 4x \)
- Volume of 2 adults' slices: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

Adding these together gives the total volume of the watermelon:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

So, the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \).

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 4x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \).

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \left( \frac{4x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

"Sure, let's break down the time Doctor Jones spends on different activities and calculate the remaining time for him to update his records.

First, he spends 9 hours at the clinic in total.

Next, he checks on 9 inpatients, and each check takes 20 minutes. So, the total time spent on inpatients is:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]
Converting 180 minutes to hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Then, he has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, the total time spent on appointments is:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]
Converting 300 minutes to hours:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the time spent on inpatients and appointments:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Since he spends 9 hours at the clinic in total, the remaining time for him to update his records is:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, I'll add up all the time required for each step and then subtract that total from 5:00 pm.

1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 180 minutes to hours:

"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Lisa sold \(3.5\) boxes, and Peter sold \(4.5\) boxes. Together, they sold \(64\) chocolate bars. We need to find out how many chocolate bars are in one box.

Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \(x\).

So, Lisa sold \(3.5x\) chocolate bars, and Peter sold \(4.5x\) chocolate bars. Together, they sold \(64\) chocolate bars, which gives us the equation:
\[3.5x + 4.5x = 64\]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[8x = 64\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by \(8\):
\[x = \frac{64}{8} = 8\]

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \(8\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[8\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The studio rents the studio for $25 per session.
2. **Variable Cost**: With 10 students, the cost per session is $1.50 per student, so the total variable cost per session is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: Adding the fixed and variable costs, the total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions per month is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) sessions.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month are the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is \(40 \times 12 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64. So, if we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes, we get the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
\[
p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Similarly, Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56. So, if we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes, we get the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes:
\[
m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Therefore, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the total population of porcupines in the park is 50. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population. So, we calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Initially, there are 50 porcupines. After a year, the total number of porcupines will be the initial number plus the number of babies born:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

So, the final number of porcupines in the park after a year is **1490**."
"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the detailed calculation:

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Pool

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

### Step 2: Convert Volume to Gallons

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Gallons} = V \times 5.9 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Cost

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) can be calculated as:

\[ C = \text{Gallons} \times 0.10 \]

Let's perform the calculations step by step.

#### Step 1: Calculate the Volume

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]
\[ V = 25 \times 56 \]
\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

#### Step 2: Convert Volume to Gallons

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Cost

\[ C = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ C = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Next, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, we calculate the yellow sticks as:

\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of sticks is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"

   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much water is remaining in the tank.

### Day 1:
- Wanda fills \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
  \[
  \text{Wanda's contribution} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumps \( \frac{3}{4} \) of what Wanda pumped.
  \[
  \text{Ms. B's contribution} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Total water pumped on Day 1:
  \[
  \text{Total on Day 1} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### Day 2:
- Wanda pumps \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on Day 1.
  \[
  \text{Wanda's contribution on Day 2} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on Day 1.
  \[
  \text{Ms. B's contribution on Day 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is **6000 gallons**."
"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the detailed calculation:

We start by noting that the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

We can cancel \( C \) from both sides of the equation (assuming \( C \neq 0 \)):
\[ 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, we need to calculate \( 0.91^5 \) and \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.656 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So,
\[ 0.656 \times 0.817 \approx 0.534 \]

We know that:
\[ 0.534 \times C = 0.28 \]
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.534} \approx 0.524 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 0.524 \) or 52.4%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52.4\%} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on the car.

First, we calculate Janet's total weekly earnings. She makes $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Since she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to determine how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is 20% of $10,000:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many weeks it will take for her to save $2000. We do this by dividing the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Anne purchased a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces of sweets is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs are to be shared equally among her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[

"Sure, let's calculate the price of carrots after three years with a 5% annual increase, starting from $120.

The formula for compound growth is:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 + r)^t \]

Where:
- \( P(t) \) is the price after \( t \) years.
- \( P_0 \) is the initial price.
- \( r \) is the annual growth rate (expressed as a decimal).
- \( t \) is the number of years.

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% expressed as a decimal)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substituting the values:

\[ P(3) = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \approx 1.157625 \]

Then, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P(3) = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P(3) \approx 139 \]

So, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"Sure, let's break it down again with a clearer approach.

Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums. We know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. This means the remaining albums are for other categories.

First, let's calculate the number of albums left for other categories:
\[ 8 \text{ total albums} - 3 \text{ selfies albums} - 2 \text{ portraits albums} = 3 \text{ other albums} \]

Since the problem doesn't specify how the remaining 3 albums are split between selfies and portraits, we can assume a simple distribution. Let's assume 2 albums are for selfies and 1 album is for portraits (or vice versa).

So, the number of selfies and portraits is:
- **Selfies**: 2 albums
- **Portraits**: 1 album

Each album contains an equal number of pictures:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Thus, the number of selfies and portraits is:
- **Selfies**: \( 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ selfies} \)
- **Portraits**: \( 1 \text{ album} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 9 \text{ portraits} \)

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 18 \text{ selfies} + 9 \text{ portraits} = 27 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To find out how long James spends reading 18 pages, we start by determining the time it takes to read one page. Since he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, the time per page is:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Now, to find the total time for 18 pages, we multiply the time per page by 18:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as if this is the first time I'm tackling it.

Initially, the hotel was fully booked with 100 guests.

- 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract those from the initial count:
  \[
  100 - 24 = 76
  \]

- Then, 15 guests checked out late, so we subtract those as well:
  \[
  76 - 15 = 61
  \]

- In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
  \[
  2 \times 15 = 30
  \]

- After dinner, 7 more guests checked in:
  \[
  30 + 7 = 37
  \]

- Finally, we add the guests who checked in to the remaining guests:
  \[
  61 + 37 = 98
  \]

So, the hotel now has 98 guests. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{98}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer persona.

Given:
- Each small stuffed animal costs $4.
- Each large stuffed animal costs three times the price of a small one, so it's $12.
- She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.
- Her total earnings from the sales were $120.

Let's denote the number of large stuffed animals sold as \( x \). Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

The total earnings equation becomes:
\[ 12x + 4(2x) = 120 \]
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, the number of large stuffed animals sold is 6. Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first calculate the daily total:

- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is \(5 + 4 + 2 = 11\) sandwiches.

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[ 11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 77 \text{ sandwiches/week} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
\[ 80 \times 1 = \$80 \]

She also sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
\[ 60 \times 4 = \$240 \]

Adding these together gives her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne then gave each of her two sisters $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = \$20 \]

Subtracting the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings leaves her with:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \$300 \]"

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days.

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - Calculate 50% of 12 pounds: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) pounds.
   - Add this to the 12 pounds: \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a day:**
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a day:**
   - Multiply the daily ore mining rate by the number of dwarves: \(40 \times 18 = 720\) pounds per day.

4. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Multiply the daily ore mining rate by the number of days: \(720 \times 30 = 21600\) pounds.

Therefore, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month is 21600 pounds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21600}

"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, I'll use the fact that the prices are proportional. Let's start by calculating the price per sandwich for the packages we know:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is $1.5 for both packages. Now, to find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"Sure, let me refine the response while adopting a persona similar to Fatima. 

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that money to reduce the cost of the new set. This means the new set costs him $2000. He then has to pay 10% of this net cost per month. To find out how much he has to pay per month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Initially, Sally had:
- 25 red balloons
- 7 green balloons
- 12 yellow balloons

A gust of wind caused 40% of the red balloons to burst. So, the number of red balloons that burst is:
\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]
This means the number of red balloons remaining is:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \]

Sally then accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. So, the number of yellow balloons released is:
\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]
This means the number of yellow balloons remaining is:
\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \]

As she neared the school, she found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. So, the number of blue balloons added is:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

Now, we sum up the remaining balloons:
- Red balloons: 15
- Green balloons: 7
- Yellow balloons: 6
- Blue balloons: 6

Adding these together gives:
\[ 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance of having a substitute teacher.
   - If the substitute teacher is present, there's a 50% chance they will collect the homework.
   - Therefore, the probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario is 50% or 0.50.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance of having the normal teacher.
   - If the normal teacher is present, there's a 40% chance they will give an extension.
   - This means there's a 60% chance they will not give an extension.
   - If the teacher does not give an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate the assignment.
   - This leaves a 80% chance that Marcus will not be able to convince the teacher.

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 100% or 1.00 (since he would have to turn it in if he doesn't get an extension)

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario: 60% (since 60% of the time he doesn't get an extension and thus has to turn it in)

The total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:

\[ 0.50 + 0.60 = 1.10 \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 1, we need to normalize this to a percentage:

\[ \frac{1.10}{2} = 0.55 \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ 0.55 \times 100 = 55\% \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

We start with the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center, which is 6000 seats. Out of these, 950 seats are reserved for graduates and 300 seats for faculty. So, the total number of seats already accounted for is 950 + 300 = 1250 seats.

This leaves us with 6000 - 1250 = 4750 seats available for the graduates and their guests.

To find out how many tickets each graduate will receive, we divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates. So, 4750 divided by 950 equals 5.

Therefore, each graduate will receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Grandpa loves jelly beans, but the size matters. For large jelly beans, he can eat 75 of them to feel full. Now, he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. And for small beans, 3 small beans are equivalent to 1 medium-sized bean.

First, we calculate how many medium-sized beans he can eat:
- Since he can eat 75 large beans, and he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, he can eat:
  \[
  2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
  \]

Next, we need to find out how many small beans he can eat. We know that 3 small beans are the same as 1 medium-sized bean. Therefore, to find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply:
- For 150 medium-sized beans, the number of small beans is:
  \[
  150 \times 3 = 450 \text{ small beans}
  \]

So, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[
\boxed{450}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so the total hours she spends on jury duty is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, her total earnings from the jury duty are:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Her total expenses for parking are:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting her expenses from her earnings gives her net earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours she spent:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes **2 dollars per hour after expenses**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Ted starts with $200. He buys 3 books at $16 each, so the total cost for the books is:

Then, he buys 3 pencils at $6 each, so the total cost for the pencils is:

\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount spent:

\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Ted spent is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start.

Richard wants to create a fountain of diet soda by placing a specific branded candy inside a bottle of soda every 3 feet along his 24-foot wide driveway. He starts at the first bottle and it takes him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, dropping the candy. We need to find out how many seconds it will take him to set off all the soda fountains.

First, let's determine how many bottles of soda Richard will place along the driveway:
- The driveway is 24 feet wide.
- He places a bottle every 3 feet.

So, the number of bottles is calculated as:
\[
\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
\]

Next, we need to figure out how many intervals he will cover to go from the first bottle to the last bottle. Since he starts at the first bottle and ends at the eighth bottle, he will go through:
- 1 interval to go from the first to the second bottle,
- 1 interval to go from the second to the third bottle,
- 1 interval to go from the third to the fourth bottle,
- 1 interval to go from the fourth to the fifth bottle,
- 1 interval to go from the fifth to the sixth bottle,
- 1 interval to go from the sixth to the seventh bottle,
- 1 interval to go from the seventh to the eighth bottle.

In total, he will go through 7 intervals. Since it takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, the total time required is:
\[
7 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 35 \text{ seconds}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{35}\) seconds."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a more conversational manner.

We start with knowing that each box contains 40 apples. Since Uncle Franky ordered two boxes, we calculate the total number of apples as follows:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Now, Uncle Franky plans to pack these apples with 8 apples in each pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound, so the cost is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 11 \text{ dollars/pound} = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

She also buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound, so the cost is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these together gives the total cost of the cheese:
\[ 22 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed during college:** Jim borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is $50,000 * 4 = $200,000.

2. **Determine his post-college income:** His original income was $25,000 per year, and his income tripled after college, so his post-college income is $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year.

3. **Calculate the total income he would have earned if he had worked the entire time:** He worked for 4 years in college and 4 years after college, totaling 8 years. So, the total income he would have earned is $75,000 * 8 = $600,000.

4. **Calculate the total amount he needs to earn to repay the loans and the money lost from not working while in school:** The total amount he needs to earn is $600,000 - $200,000 = $400,000.

5. **Determine how long it would take to earn $400,000 at his post-college income of $75,000 per year:** To find out how many years it would take, we divide $400,000 by $75,000, which gives us approximately 5.33 years. Since he can't work a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number, which means it would take him 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Therefore, the final answer is 6 years."
"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, I'll start by calculating the dimensions of each piece of fabric he requires. The bed measures 6 feet by 8 feet. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the dimensions of each piece of fabric will be:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Next, I'll calculate the area of one piece of fabric:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, I'll multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet} \]

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday.

1. **Monday:**
   The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   The number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters on Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17
   \]
   First, calculate one-fifth of 425:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
   \]
   Then add 17:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday:**
   The number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters on Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5
   \]
   First, calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then add 5:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

4. **Total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209
   \]
   Adding these numbers together:
   \[
   425 + 102 = 527

"Sure, let's break it down again from the start.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
   - Amount lost in the first race: $5
   - Twice the amount lost: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race: $11
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost over the three races:
- Amount lost in the first race: $5
- Amount lost in the third race: $16.5
- Total amount lost: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average amount lost per race: \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\)

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[

To find the total number of cities in South America, we multiply the number of countries by the number of cities per country:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Now, to find the total population, we multiply the number of cities by the population per city:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total population in South America is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step for clarity.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is 48 inches. He grew 3 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches. He grew 2 inches, so his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's current heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the share of the first person.

We denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked. Since they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day for 3 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days worked is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days. So, the total number of days worked is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \) days.

2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters. Since each painter works \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day, the total number of hours worked by all 4 painters is \( 7.875 \times 4 = 31.5 \) hours.

3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter. Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is \( \frac{31.5}{4} = 7.875 \) hours.

So, each painter put in 7.875 hours of work.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.875 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer approach.

Given:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the second set, he retrieved \( x \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved is 19.

We set up the equation:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To combine \( 2x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \), we convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[
2x = \frac{4x}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

So, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Certainly, let's calculate the price of the car in 2010 with the given depreciation rate.

Starting with the initial price of $20,000 in 2007, the car depreciates by 21% each year. This means it retains 79% of its value each year.

1. **2007 to 2008:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800
   \]

2. **2008 to 2009:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2009} = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12522
   \]

3. **2009 to 2010:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2010} = 12522 \times 0.79 = 9830.18
   \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9830.18.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9830.18}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

1. First, we know there are 50 books in total.
2. Half of these books are in English, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
3. Next, 10% of the books are in German. To find this, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
   \]
4. To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total:
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is 20.

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step. Bernice has driven 325 kilometers out of the total distance of approximately 1955 kilometers from San Diego to New York City. To find out how many kilometers she still needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already covered from the total distance:

\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers. 

The correct answer is 1630 kilometers."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. Over 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to convert these cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons she drinks in 30 days is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days is 15 gallons. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train. Twice that number, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) people, board the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]
   So, there are 110 people on the train at the final stop.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"Sure, let's break it down again to ensure clarity. Alison bought:

- A tank top for $10.
- Running shorts for $5 more than the tank top, which makes it $15.
- Tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so $24.
- Athletic socks that originally cost $8 but with a $2 off coupon, making it $6.

Now, let's add up the costs:

\[
10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55
\]

So, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear.

The final answer is \(\boxed{55}\)."
"To renovate the kitchen floor, I need to figure out how many tiles I'll need and then calculate the total cost. Each tile is 1 square foot since it's a square tile with a side length of 1 foot, meaning each tile covers exactly 1 square foot. The kitchen floor has a total area of 200 square feet, so I'll need 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400
\]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

James has to buy insurance because he had an accident, and the cost is 60% more than the normal monthly cost. The normal cost is $120 a month. To find out how much he pays a year, we first calculate the increased monthly cost.

The increased cost per month is:
\[ 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

So, the total cost per month with the increased rate is $120 + $72 = $192.

To find the annual cost, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12:
\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Determine the number of loads for the twin beds:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds.
   - Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of loads for the king size bed:**
   - Greg has 1 king size bed.
   - Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of loads per week:**
   - Total loads per week = Loads for twin beds + Loads for king size bed
   - Total loads per week = 2 loads + 1 load = 3 loads

4. **Calculate the total number of loads per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total loads per year = Loads per week × Weeks per year
   - Total loads per year = 3 loads/week × 52 weeks/year = 156 loads

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is:
\[
\boxed{156}

3. **Total movies watched in one weekend:** This is the sum of the movies watched on Saturday and Sunday, which is \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.
4. **Total movies watched in 4 weeks:** Since there are 4 weekends in 4 weeks, the total number of movies watched is \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \).

Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 24."
"Sure, let me calculate this again from scratch.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he collected 50 more stickers, so he had \(100 + 50 = 150\) stickers. This year, he collected twice the number of stickers he collected last year, which means he collected \(2 \times 50 = 100\) stickers. Adding these together, the total number of stickers Leo has now is \(150 + 100 = 250\).

So, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is:

"Sure, let me calculate this again from scratch.

Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them 60 grams of cat food twice a day. So, each cat consumes:
\[ 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams/day} \]

With 3 cats, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Now, to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step with the information provided.

Becky ate 10 slices. Jake ate 7 slices (since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake). Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, which means Silvia ate 14 slices.

Now, let's add up the slices they all ate:
- Becky: 10 slices
- Jake: 7 slices
- Silvia: 14 slices

Total slices eaten = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is 31. 

The correct answer is: **31**"
"Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step.

We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time for the meal was 98 minutes. Let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Consequently, Betsy's part would take \( D + 18 \) minutes.

Given the total time:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. To find Betsy's part, we add 18 minutes to Donovan's part:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To find the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to add up the costs of the cast, the visit, the painkillers, and the parking.

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit, which is half an hour. So, the cost is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers. The total cost is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. The total cost is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all these costs:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[
\boxed{482}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as if this is the first time I'm tackling the problem.

James gets 80 emails a day. If 20% of these emails don't require a response, then 80% of the emails do require a response. To find out how many emails require a response each day, we calculate:

\[
80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ emails per day}
\]

Now, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails requiring a response per day by 5:

\[
64 \times 5 = 320 \text{ emails in a 5-day work week}
\]

So, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is 320. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{320}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. So, the number of pizzas they ate is:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
Therefore, the number of pizzas left with the glee club is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which means they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas. So, the number of pizzas they ate is:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
Therefore, the number of pizzas left with the football team is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, to find the total number of pizzas left, we add the pizzas left with the glee club and the football team:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the total number of pizzas left is 14. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. So, the number of big coupons he wants to send is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he is sending 700 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he is sending 1400 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these together gives the total cost in cents:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

After that, Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches, making the total:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

\[ 24 \]

The correct answer is 24."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Mr. Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Two hours after departure, it was reported that a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures and couldn't deliver the fertiliser.

First, we calculate the number of trucks that had mechanical failures:

\[
\text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
\text{Number of successful trucks} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser delivered is:

\[
\text{Total tons of fertiliser delivered} = 15 \times 20 = 300
\]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To find out how much it will cost Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion, let's break it down step by step.

First, Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter because he needs 1 pound for every dozen croissants, and he's making 6 dozen.

The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds of butter, Dennis only pays for 1 pound. 

Let's calculate how many sets of 2 pounds he needs to buy:
- Dennis needs 6 pounds, so he needs 3 sets of 2 pounds (since 6 divided by 2 is 3).

For each set of 2 pounds, he pays for 1 pound:
- The cost for 1 pound of butter is $4.00.

So, for 3 sets:
- The total cost is 3 sets times $4.00 per set, which equals $12.00.

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step with a fresh perspective.

Kayla invited the following people:
- 25 classmates
- 7 girls in her dance class
- 13 family members

Total guests invited: \(25 + 7 + 13 = 45\)

Out of these, 4 people couldn't come, so the number of guests who will attend is:
\(45 - 4 = 41\)

The base fee to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests. For the additional guests beyond 20, there is an additional fee of $6 per guest. So, the additional guests are:
\(41 - 20 = 21\)

The additional fee for these 21 guests is:
\(21 \times 6 = 126\)

Adding the base fee and the additional fee gives us the total cost:
\(125 + 126 = 251\)

Therefore, the total cost for the party is \(\boxed{251}\)."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day.

First, we know that Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. One monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so the second monkey eats 14 bananas each day.

To find out how many bananas the first monkey eats in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

For the second monkey, we do the same:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we add the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week:
\[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

Since Mr. Robles bought 315 bananas in total, we subtract the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total to find out how many bananas the third monkey eats in a week:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Sure, let me clarify this for you as Fatima would.

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny has five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the total cost is $30 and she only has $25, she needs an additional $5. The florist will give her change in quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the number of quarters she will receive is:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, let's break down the schedule step by step:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves in 10 minutes, so it arrives in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.
   - The second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed in the station.
   - The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves in 60 minutes (30 + 30).
   - The third train arrives in 60 + 60 = 120 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves in 120 minutes.
   - The fourth train arrives in 120 + 20 = 140 minutes.

Paul needs to board the fourth train, which arrives at 140 minutes after the first train arrives. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, Paul will wait for the fourth train for 140 - 10 = 130 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Paul will wait for his train is 130 minutes."

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find the percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend received.

1. **Calculate the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
   - So, the price he paid is \(2000 \times 0.75 = 1500\).

2. **Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for:**
   - Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
   - So, the price he sold it for is \(1500 \times 1.20 = 1800\).

3. **Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received:**
   - The original price of the watch is $2000.
   - Mr. Rogers' friend sold it for $1800.
   - The discount amount is \(2000 - 1800 = 200\).

"Sure, let me clarify the journey for James again from my perspective.

James starts walking from his home to the store, which is 4 miles away. When he reaches the halfway point, which is 2 miles from his home, he realizes he forgot something. So, he has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles. After picking up what he forgot, he walks the full 4 miles to the store again.

Given that he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can calculate the time for each segment of his journey.

1. **First Segment (Home to Halfway Point):**
   - Distance: 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \)

2. **Second Segment (Halfway Point Back Home):**
   - Distance: 2 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time: \( \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Third Segment (Home to Store):**
   - Distance: 4 miles
   - Speed: 4 miles per hour
   - Time: \( \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \)

Adding up the times for all segments:
- Total time: \( 0.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \)

So, the total time it took James to reach the store is 2 hours. 

The correct answer is **2 hours**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. So, she buys a total of:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

If she buys the bananas individually at $0.80 each, the total cost would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, if she buys the bananas in bunches, each bunch costs $3.00, so for 10 bunches, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

The amount of money saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money saved is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

If Sam and Harry together have 100 feet of fence and they agree that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can set up the equation as follows:

Let \( S \) be the amount of fence Sam gets. Then Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total fence is 100 feet, so we have:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount of fence left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

To find out how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to consider the rate at which the farmer makes bales and the rate at which the truck picks them up.

1. **Calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

2. **Calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:**
   - The truck picks up 3 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the truck picks up \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \) bales.

3. **Calculate the net number of bales left in the field:**
   - The net number of bales is the number of bales made minus the number of bales picked up.
   - Net bales = \( 30 - 18 = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour day is 12.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, let's break down the information step by step:

1. **Total periods John takes each day:** 
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John takes \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Total time John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Total time John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - First, find the total weekly minutes:

     \]
   - Then, calculate the extra learning time:
     \[
     \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Total time John spends learning each week:**
   - Total time in class each week: 1600 minutes.
   - Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday: 100 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is:
     \[
     1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning in hours is:

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, I'll start by calculating the total area of the walls that need to be painted. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is **$144**."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 of them.
   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - This leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken.

2. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.

3. **Ellen's Friend's Turn:**
   - Ellen's friend now has to choose 1 soda from the remaining 4 sodas (2 shaken and 2 unshaken).

To find the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda, we look at the number of shaken sodas left and the total number of sodas left.

- Number of shaken sodas left: 2
- Total number of sodas left: 4

The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas left}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

To express this probability as a percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

If two trains are traveling in opposite directions, we need to calculate the total distance they cover in 3 hours.

1. **Speed of the first train:** 60 miles per hour.
2. **Speed of the second train:** Half the speed of the first train, which is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours:

- Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).
- Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:

- Total distance = \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

Therefore, the final answer is 270 miles."
"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start to ensure clarity.

We need to determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes from March 1st to April 19th, considering he takes 20% of the days off.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.**

- March has 31 days.
- April has 19 days.
- Total days = 31 (March) + 19 (April) = 50 days.

To find \( N \), we solve for \( N \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:
\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Performing the division:
\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} = \frac{240 \times 100}{40} = \frac{24000}{40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, we need to find the number of girls in the school. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls. We calculate the number of girls as follows:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times N = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost of the pots is $19.
2. The cost of the sack of garden soil is $26.
3. She used a coupon for $7 off.

First, we add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil:
\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract the value of the coupon:
\[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

So, the total amount of money my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 38 \]"
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step.

We have:
- Three women wearing 4-inch heels, which totals \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women wearing 2-inch heels, which totals \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together gives us a total height of \(12 + 6 = 18\) inches for all the heels.

Since there are 6 women in total, we find the average height of the heels by dividing the total height by the number of women:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

The correct answer is 3 inches."
"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start.

Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles in June, which has 30 days. She intends to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. First, let's calculate how many miles she plans to hike per day:

\[ 125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day} \]

To complete her journey in 30 days, she needs to hike:

\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

The difference between the required miles per day and the planned miles per day is:

\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final numerical answer is:

"Certainly, let's break it down step by step to find out the total revenue from selling all the balls.

1. **Red Balls:**
   - Number of red balls: 3
   - Cost per red ball: $9
   - Total revenue from red balls: \( 3 \times 9 = 27 \)

2. **Blue Balls:**
   - Number of blue balls: 11
   - Cost per blue ball: $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls: \( 11 \times 5 = 55 \)

3. **Green Balls:**
   - Number of green balls: 25
   - Cost per green ball: $3
   - Total revenue from green balls: \( 25 \times 3 = 75 \)

\]

So, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many kilograms of apples James will have left.

First, we calculate how much Pierre wants. Since Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[
\text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we calculate how much Paul wants. Paul wants one-third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, we add the amounts that Pierre and Paul want to find out how much apples they collectively want:
\[
\text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Since the total amount of apples bought by Pierre, Paul, and Jacques is 12 kg, the amount of apples left for James is:
\[
\text{Apples left for James} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Therefore, the number of kilograms of apples James will have left is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"

So, the amount of money Raymond has left is:

\[ \$8 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Anna started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. This means she has spent:

\[
16 - 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Out of this $14, she spent $4 on other items. Therefore, the amount spent on the books is:

\[
14 - 4 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since she bought 2 books and both cost the same amount, the cost of each book is:

\[
\frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the cost of each book is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"Certainly! Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class. If this year there was a 20% increase in enrollment, we can calculate the number of students this year by finding 20% of 50 and adding it to the original number.

First, let's find 20% of 50:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

Now, we add this increase to the original number of students:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To find out how long it will take the lighthouse light to blink 459 times, we start by determining the rate of blinking. Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the number of blinks per minute:

\[
\text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Now, to find out how many minutes it will take to blink 459 times, we divide the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute:

\[
\text{Time in minutes} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times. The correct answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

Then, Tate buys:
- 2 more male guppies
- 1 more female guppy
- 2 more male goldfishes
- 3 more female goldfishes

So, after the purchase:
- The total number of male guppies becomes \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- The total number of female guppies becomes \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- The total number of male goldfishes becomes \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- The total number of female goldfishes becomes \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Now, to find out how many more female fish there are than male fish:
- Total number of male fish is \(6 + 5 = 11\)
- Total number of female fish is \(8 + 8 = 16\)

The difference between the number of female fish and male fish is:
\[ 16 - 11 = 5 \]

So, Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the chores again to find the total time they took:

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Mowing the lawn took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Walking the dog took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \(4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Doing laundry took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time is more than \(4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}\).
   - Let's assume Dior took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption given the problem's phrasing).

Now, we sum up the total time taken by all three:

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours} = 22 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many miles John drives each month when visiting his parents.

1. **Driving Time for One Way:**
   John spends 2 hours driving one way.

2. **Speed of Driving:**
   He drives at a speed of 70 mph.

3. **Distance for One Way:**
   Using the formula Distance = Speed × Time, we calculate the distance for one way:
   \[
   \text{Distance one way} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Round Trip Distance:**
   Since John visits his parents twice a month, the round trip distance is:
   \[
   \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 280 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of miles John drives each month when visiting his parents is 280 miles. 

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{280}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as if I'm Fatima.

Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. In 7 days, she will walk:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

The problem states that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if we let \( B \) be the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we can set up the equation:
\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the production of the first two workers:**
   - Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
   - Together, they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

2. **Calculate the production of the next two workers:**
   - Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
   - Together, they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

3. **Calculate the combined production of the first four workers:**
   - The first two workers produce 12 toys per hour.
   - The next two workers produce 8 toys per hour.
   - Together, they produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

4. **Determine the total number of toys needed to ship the order:**
   - The order is for 400 toys.
   - They still need 20 toys to ship the order.
   - Therefore, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

5. **Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker:**
   - The first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours.
   - The fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.
   - Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

So, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog, which is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, would be:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog, which is half the weight of Kory's dog, would be:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs together:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add this to the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step to find out how many stickers Seth originally had.

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. This means Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total. Therefore, \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

So, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we start by calculating half of the Earth's circumference. The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that is:

\[
\frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:

\[
\frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth is 50 days."
"Sure, let me break it down for you in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Given:
- The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
- The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
- The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.

First, we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we find the speed of the fastest car by multiplying the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour."
"Certainly! Let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

1. **Determine Liam's age two years ago:**
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.
   - Two years ago, Liam's age was \(16 - 2 = 14\) years old.

2. **Set up the relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages:**
   - Two years ago, Liam's age (14) was twice the age of Vince.
   - Let \(V\) represent Vince's age two years ago.

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   - Two years ago, Liam's age was 14, and this was twice Vince's age.
   - Therefore, \(14 = 2V\).

4. **Solve for Vince's age two years ago:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]
   - So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago.

5. **Determine Vince's current age:**
   - Since two years have passed since then, Vince's current age is:
     \[
     7 + 2 = 9
     \]

Thus, Vince is currently 9 years old.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer focus on the numbers given:

We know the total number of eggs painted by Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah is 56. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, with Camden painting 12 more than Sarah.

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number, we have:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is 8. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step with a fresh perspective.

Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8. This means he will have:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will go into one box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. Therefore, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step with a clearer persona.

John starts with an 80-foot tree. He can make logs out of 80% of the tree, so the length of the logs he can get is:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

Next, he cuts these 64 feet into 4-foot logs. The number of 4-foot logs he gets is:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

From each of these 16 logs, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he gets is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Each plank is sold for $1.2, so the total revenue from selling all the planks is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount John makes is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"Sure, let me break it down for you in a clearer manner, keeping my persona as Fatima.

Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, her brother earns twice that amount, which is $10000 per month.

Next, we find their combined salary:
\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Adding up all their salaries gives us the total amount of money they have together:
\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000.

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Grandma walks 3 miles in total, which includes 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and her speed on the beach is \( \frac{1}{20} \) miles per minute. This means her speed on the sidewalk, being twice as fast, is \( \frac{1}{10} \) miles per minute.

First, let's confirm her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, to find the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on both segments:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is 50 minutes. The correct answer is:

Jane has already saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, which totals to $32. Her goal is to save $60 in total. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal:

\[
60 - 32 = 28 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide the amount still needed by the weekly savings:

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, which is 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. So, we can find out how many marbles he originally has by subtracting those 24 marbles from 60:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob starts with 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 of those marbles, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have 26 marbles.

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other is an unknown temperature, which we'll call \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle, leaving 29 degrees in that mug. He also pours 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, so the temperature of the water he pours from the second mug is \( T - 1 \) degrees.

The total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces, and the average temperature of the water in the bottle is the sum of the temperatures of the water poured from both mugs divided by 5. This average temperature must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it:

\[
\frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the inequality:

\[
\frac{28 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5:

\[
28 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 28 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 172
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 172 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{172}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

Initially, the farm has:
- 50 cows
- 20 chickens

Over three weeks, which is 21 days:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 21 days, they bring \(20 \times 21 = 420\) cows.
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 21 days, they bring \(10 \times 21 = 210\) chickens.

Adding these to the initial numbers:
- The total number of cows after three weeks is \(50 + 420 = 470\).
- The total number of chickens after three weeks is \(20 + 210 = 230\).

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 700 \]"

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since he orders 4 packs, he gets a 10% discount on the total cost. The discount amount is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Russell gets 4 packs of bagels, and each pack contains 9 bagels. Therefore, the total number of bagels is:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step. First, we determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we calculate:

\[
23 - 5 = 18
\]

Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. The problem states that 1 less than 3 scoops is 2 scoops. It also mentions that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. So, we calculate:

\[
6 - 3 = 3
\]

This means it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion based on the given information:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for the first 30 days. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the first 30 days is:
\[ 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs} \]

Next, for the next 30 days, Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, the total number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days is:
\[ 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days:
\[ 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs} \]

Now, to find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20 \, \text{dozen} \]

So, the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

1. Jess can see there are 17 green jellybeans.
2. The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans, so that's \(2 \times 17 = 34\) red jellybeans.
3. The total number of jellybeans is 60.

To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:

\[
\text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9
\]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9. 

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Tim grows 5 trees, and each year he collects 6 lemons from each tree. To find out how many lemons he gets in a decade, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the lemons from one tree in one year:**
   \[
   \text{Lemons per tree per year} = 6
   \]

2. **Calculate the total lemons from all trees in one year:**
   \[
   \text{Total lemons per year} = \text{Number of trees} \times \text{Lemons per tree per year}
   \]
   Given that Tim has 5 trees:
   \[
   \text{Total lemons per year} = 5 \times 6 = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the total lemons in a decade:**
   A decade is 10 years, so we multiply the total lemons collected in one year by 10:
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = \text{Total lemons per year} \times 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = 30 \times 10 = 300
   \]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of women remaining on the bus after 20 alight.

1. **Understanding the Ratio and Total Passengers:**
   The ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women, making a total of 14 parts.

2. **Calculating the Number of Women Initially:**
   Since the total parts (14) correspond to 84 passengers, each part represents:
   \[
   \frac{84}{14} = 6 \text{ passengers}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of women (9 parts) is:
   \[
   9 \times 6 = 54 \text{ women}
   \]

3. **Adjusting for the Alighting Women:**
   If 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining is:
   \[
   54 - 20 = 34 \text{ women}
   \]

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
\[
\boxed{34}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days.

1. **Sunflower Sales:**
   - Faraday earns $2 per sunflower.
   - He earned $26 from sunflowers per day.
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day from sunflowers = \(\frac{26}{2} = 13\) sunflowers.

2. **Bouquet Sales:**
   - Faraday earns $8 per bouquet.
   - He earned $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = \(\frac{56}{8} = 7\) bouquets.
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Number of sunflowers in 7 bouquets = \(7 \times 12 = 84\) sunflowers.

3. **Total Sunflowers Sold Per Day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers from sunflowers + Sunflowers from bouquets = \(13 + 84 = 97\) sunflowers.

4. **Total Sunflowers Sold After 3 Days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold after 3 days = \(97 \times 3 = 291\) sunflowers.

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is 291."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money Adam loses.

Adam starts with $100 and buys rocks at $5 each. The number of rocks he can buy is:

\[
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

He then sells 60% of these rocks. The number of rocks he sells is:

\[
\text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12
\]

Each rock is sold for $7, so the revenue from selling 12 rocks is:

\[
\text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = 12 \times 7 = 84
\]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and he sells 12 rocks for $84. Therefore, the money left after selling the rocks is:

\[
\text{Money left} = 100 - (20 \times 5) + 84 = 100 - 100 + 84 = 84
\]

The amount of money Adam loses is:

\[
\text{Money lost} = 100 - 84 = 16
\]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

Lauren can draw:
- 5 large-sized picture scenes per day,
- 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day,
- 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.

She needs to create:
- 45 large-sized picture scenes,
- 36 medium-sized picture scenes,
- 49 small-sized picture scenes.

First, we calculate the number of days required for each type of picture scene:

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
   - The number of days required is:
     \[
     \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
   - The number of days required is:
     \[
     \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
   - The number of days required is:
     \[
     \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}
     \]

Now, we sum the days required for each type of picture scene:
\[
9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, the total number of days it will take for Lauren to create all of the picture scenes is:

"To find the average speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

First, we calculate the total distance traveled:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the total time taken:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The average speed Sid was traveling is \( 50 \text{ miles per hour} \).

The correct answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we need to find the probability of winning for each ticket. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be written as 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first, so its probability of winning is 3 times 0.20, which is 0.60.

Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
\[ P(\text{Both tickets are winners}) = P(\text{Winning first ticket}) \times P(\text{Winning second ticket}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%. 

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{12\%}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many seashells each person got.

First, we know Jim collected 27 seashells. According to the problem, Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. So, if we let the number of seashells Carlos collected be \( C \), we can write:
\[ J = C + 5 \]
Given \( J = 27 \), we substitute and solve for \( C \):
\[ 27 = C + 5 \]
\[ C = 27 - 5 \]
\[ C = 22 \]

Next, we know Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let the number of seashells Carrey collected be \( R \). So we have:
\[ C = 2R \]
Given \( C = 22 \), we substitute and solve for \( R \):
\[ 22 = 2R \]
\[ R = \frac{22}{2} \]
\[ R = 11 \]

Now, we add up the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:
\[ C + J + R = 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \]

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

So, each person got 20 seashells. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

On the weekend, which consists of Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Adding the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend gives us the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

Therefore, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 30.

The correct answer is:

To determine Linus's profit, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.**

Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price.
\[ \text{Selling price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought.**

Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday.
\[ \text{Total cost} = (2 \times 20) + (4 \times 20) = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.**

The total number of devices sold is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:

Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we calculate Ned's height as follows:
\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so:
\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so:
\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle of juice.
   - Therefore, 100% of a person's daily energy demand is covered by 5 bottles of juice (since 100% / 20% = 5).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - Each person needs 5 bottles.
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more bottles are needed:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - The number of additional bottles needed is:
     \[
     11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
     \]

Thus, Hortex would need to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is:

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, we determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
\[ 1 + 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \).

The total number of tax reports received last week is 5168. On Monday and Tuesday, they received a total of 1907 reports, and on Thursday and Friday, they received a total of 2136 reports. To find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports.

So, the calculation is:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land.

1. **First Sale:**
   He sold half of his land for $50.
   \[
   \text{Area sold in the first sale} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   The price per square meter for the first sale is:
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

2. **Second Sale:**
   He then sold another 1/4 of his land for $30.
   \[
   \text{Area sold in the second sale} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   The price per square meter for the second sale is:
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

3. **Remaining Land:**
   After the first and second sales, the remaining land is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining area} = 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   Abraham sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from remaining land} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}

"Certainly! Let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, we can calculate the number of face masks he uses in a day first.

1. **Face masks used per outing:**
   - Tyrion changes his mask two times per outing.
   - So, for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.

2. **Face masks used per day:**
   - Tyrion goes out three times a day.
   - For each outing, he uses 2 face masks.
   - Therefore, the number of face masks used per day is:
     \[
     3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ face masks/outing} = 6 \text{ face masks/day}
     \]

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days:
- If he uses 6 face masks per day, then in 2 days, he will use:
  \[
  6 \text{ face masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ face masks}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 36 eggs in total.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds \(2 \times 5 = 10\) eggs.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds \(10 - 2 = 8\) eggs.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add up the eggs found by each person:
\[5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27\]

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
\[36 - 27 = 9\]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money John makes in a week.

First, we calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex has 60% more apartments than the combined total of the first two complexes:
\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

So, the total number of apartments John collects garbage from in a week is:
\[ 3 \times (200 + 200 + 640) = 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 per collection, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money John makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{1248} \]"

Given:
1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we express \( B \) in terms of \( Y \):
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

Next, we substitute \( B \) into the combined length equation:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ R + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ R + 2Y - 7 = 37 \]
\[ R + 2Y = 44 \]

Since \( R = 4B \), we substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into \( R = 4B \):
\[ R = 4(Y - 7) \]
\[ R = 4Y - 28 \]

Now, we substitute \( R = 4Y - 28 \) into the combined length equation:
\[ 4Y - 28 + 2Y = 44 \]
\[ 6Y - 28 = 44 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

With \( Y = 12 \), we find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And then we find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given three times that amount, which is $15. After each of them gave an equal amount of money, say \( x \), to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money. This means:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side:

\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

So,

\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

This means each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Therefore, the amount left with Ronnie is:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the amount left in Ronnie's money is $2. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total. Half of the mural is yellow, so that means 6 pints are yellow. The remaining paint is split equally between red, white, and purple.

So, we have:
\[ R + W + P + Y = 12 \]
\[ R + W + P + 6 = 12 \]
\[ R + W + P = 6 \]

Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can say:
\[ R = W = P \]

Let's denote the amount of red paint as \( R \). Then:
\[ R + R + R = 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Therefore, the amount of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, I'll break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of one bedroom:**
   \[
   \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total area of the 4 bedrooms:**
   \[
   \text{Total area of 4 bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the living room:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total area of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet}
   \]

The total area of the house is \(3160\) square feet."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs.
2. **Tuesday**: She counts double the number of clouds from Monday, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) puffs.

Now, let's add up all the puffs:

\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93
\]

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 puffs of clouds. 

The final answer is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

1. **Determine the number of pods in the new box:**
   - The original box has 100 pods.
   - The new box has 20% more pods than the original box.
   - Calculate 20% of 100 pods: \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Add this to the original number of pods: \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Calculate the cost per pod:**
   - The new box costs $12 for 120 pods.
   - Cost per pod: \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Determine the number of cycles that can be run for $1:**
   - Each cycle uses 1 pod.
   - Cost per cycle: $0.10.
   - Number of cycles for $1: \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) cycles.

Thus, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is 10.

The correct answer is **10**."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he gets, we divide $1000 by $20:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

He loses 10 bills on the way home, so he has:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

Next, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, he has:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills left}
\]

After that, he triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

When he triples this amount, he has:

\[
3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, he converts all his money to $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again from the start with a fresh perspective.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals Scored:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The total number of goals scored in the match is 16."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem again to find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday.

2. **Chalk Usage on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. So, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Therefore, the chalk remaining after Monday is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Chalk Recycled**: Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The remaining chalk after Monday is 2.75 inches, which is greater than 2 inches, so no chalk is recycled yet.

4. **Daily Usage**: The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the chalk used each day is 20% of the remaining chalk.

5. **Chalk Remaining Calculation**:
   - **Tuesday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
     \]

     \]
   - **Thursday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 1.76 = 0.352 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 1.76 - 0.352 = 1.408 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Friday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 1.408 = 0.2816 \text{ inches}

   - **Tuesday of Next Week**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.5767168 = 0.11534336 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.5767168 - 0.11534336 = 0.46137344 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Wednesday of Next Week**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.46137344 = 0.092274688 \text{ inches}

     \]

Since the chalk remaining on Sunday of the next week is 0.1511828488192 inches, which is still greater than 2 inches, the teacher will continue to use the chalk until it is recycled.

8. **Days Calculation**:
   - Monday to Sunday of the next week: 7 days

Therefore, the teacher has 7 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to find out how many students are not on varsity.

- There are 12 girls in the class.
- One-third of the girls are on varsity, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) girls are on varsity.
- Therefore, the number of girls not on varsity is \( 12 - 4 = 8 \).

- There are 12 boys in the class.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, which means \( \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \) boys are on varsity.
- Therefore, the number of boys not on varsity is \( 12 - 3 = 9 \).

Adding the number of girls and boys not on varsity gives us:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

So, the number of students not on varsity is 17."

"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

James has 30 teeth. His dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. To find out what percentage of James' teeth the dentist fixes, we can follow these steps:

1. The dentist drills 4 teeth.
2. The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.
3. The total number of teeth fixed is \(4 + 11 = 15\).
4. To find the percentage of teeth fixed, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values, we get:
   \[
   \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \(50\%\).

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Mr. Marcellus received in refunds.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased:**
   - Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon.
   - Total cost = 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14000.

2. **Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date:**
   - Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk that he purchased.
   - Amount of milk returned = 2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons.

3. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   - The cost of the 1600 gallons of milk returned is 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5600.

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus received a refund of $5600. 

The correct answer is **$5600**."
"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step as if it's the first time I'm tackling it.

We have two key pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
\[ W = 5(20 + 7) \]
\[ W = 5 \times 27 \]
\[ W = 135 \]

2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)
\[ 20 + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( 20 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Bob has a total of $27,000 to spend on books. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we can calculate it as follows:

\[ \text{Number of books} = \frac{27000}{500} \times 100 = 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

So, Bob can buy 5400 books with $27,000. Now, to distribute these books equally among the 3 schools, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[ \text{Books per school} = \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

Therefore, each school gets 1800 books. The final answer is:

   - Apples on the ground: 2

2. **First interaction**:
   - Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 1 (remaining apple)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1 (pocketed apple) + 1 (thrown apple) = 2

3. **Second interaction**:
   - Newton picked up the remaining apple, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 0 (all apples thrown)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 2 (pocketed apples) + 1 (thrown apple) = 3

4. **Third interaction**:
   - Newton picked up all the remaining apples (6 more apples fell out of the tree).
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 3 (pocketed apples) + 6 (picked up apples) = 9

Therefore, Newton brought home 9 apples.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate the total number of cheese pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 6 slices:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to find out how many cheese pizzas are required:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pepperoni pizza slices consumed by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 4 slices:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many pepperoni pizzas are required:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. Adding these together:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider both his production rate and the rate at which the snowballs melt.

1. **Rate of Snowball Production:**
   Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Rate of Snowball Melt:**
   2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. In one hour, there are 4 intervals of 15 minutes, so 2 snowballs melt in each interval, leading to:
   \[
   2 \text{ snowballs/interval} \times 4 \text{ intervals} = 8 \text{ snowballs}
   \]
   Therefore, the net number of snowballs Jay produces in one hour is:
   \[
   20 \text{ snowballs} - 8 \text{ snowballs} = 12 \text{ snowballs}
   \]

3. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs:**
   To find out how many hours it takes to produce 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net production rate:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."

"Certainly, let's break down the problem again to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 + 100 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used \(81 - 78 = 3\) bandages more than they needed to reach 78 bandages.

Since they had 81 bandages after ordering and using 25, and they ended up with 78, it means they used 3 more bandages than necessary. This confirms the calculations.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{62}
\]"
"To determine the total cost for May's haircut and color, let's break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of the Hair Color**: This is a fixed cost of $40.
2. **Cost of the Haircut**: The length of hair cut is calculated by subtracting the final length from the initial length. May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is \(10 - 8 = 2\) inches. Since the cost of the haircut is $30 per inch, the total cost for the haircut is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) dollars.

Adding the cost of the hair color and the haircut together, we get:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, the total cost for May's haircut and color is \(\boxed{100}\) dollars."
"To determine how much Jen will receive, I'll break down the calculation step by step.

First, let's calculate Jen's daily earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Daily earnings = 7.5 hours/day * $1.5/hour = $11.25/day

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
- Jen works 6 days a week.

Weekly earnings = $11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.50/week

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, we calculate her total earnings for the month:
- Total earnings for April = $67.50/week * 4 weeks = $270.00

Additionally, Jen receives an extra $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she did not incur any absences for April, she will receive this bonus for 4 weeks:
- Total attendance bonus for April = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40.00

Finally, we add her total earnings for the month and her total attendance bonus:
- Total amount Jen will receive = $270.00 + $40.00 = $310.00

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{310}
\]"
"Sure, let's break down the earnings again to ensure clarity.

- For doing laundry, Jason earns $3.00 once.
- For cleaning his room, he earns $1.50 once.
- For taking the trash out, he earns $0.75 each time and he did it twice, so that's $0.75 * 2 = $1.50.
- For emptying the dishwasher, he earns $0.50 each time and he did it 6 times, so that's $0.50 * 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's sum these up:
- Laundry: $3.00
- Cleaning room: $1.50
- Taking out trash: $1.50
- Emptying dishwasher: $3.00

Adding these together:
\[ 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00 \]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 over the two-week period."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, to find out how much blood ten sharks have:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is 1200 gallons. 

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"Certainly! Let's break down the information step by step to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day.

1. **Morning Entry:**
   - 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.

2. **Entry at 10:00:**
   - 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00.
   - These 40 people ordered the same amount of food as the first 50 people.

3. **Additional Entry:**
   - Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in later.
   - Number of people who came in later = \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

4. **Evening Entry:**
   - An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.
   - Number of people who came in evening = \(3 \times 50 = 150\).

Now, we sum up all the entries:

- Morning entry: 50 people
- Entry at 10:00: 40 people
- Additional entry: 80 people
- Evening entry: 150 people

Total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:

\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 260 \]

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is **260**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She also bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 25 red pens, the number of packs of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Adding the red and black pens together gives:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is:

\[ 75 \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 75 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. This means each bottle of scotch costs:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac, so he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

Since each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, the total cost for the cognac is:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the cost of the scotch and the cognac gives us the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the final amount John spends on everything is:

\[
\boxed{2400}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees and twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, which means he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than the first day, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 more trees. So, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's add up the total trees planted over the two days:
- White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 trees
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 trees

So, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 50 + 90 = 140 trees.

The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Fred starts with 24 gallons of root beer. On the first day, he makes 24 gallons, but his children drink 4 gallons, leaving him with:
\[ 24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons} \]

On the second day, his wife spills 7 gallons, so he has:
\[ 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons} \]

On the third day, his friend Ronnie drinks 5 gallons, leaving:
\[ 13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons} \]

On the fourth day, 3 people show up for the party, and the root beer is shared equally. Therefore, the amount of root beer each person can drink is:
\[ \frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons} \]

So, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is \(\frac{8}{3}\) gallons. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}
\]"
"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given the equation: \(4x + 8 = 40\).

First, we need to isolate \(x\). We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8\]
\[4x = 32\]

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{32}{4}\]
\[x = 8\]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \(8\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[8\]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

We start with 66 fish in the tank. One-third of these fish have red stripes. So, we calculate the number of fish with red stripes as follows:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

After accounting for the fish with red stripes, we have:

\[
66 - 22 = 44 \text{ fish remaining}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes. According to the problem, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. So, we calculate the number of fish with blue stripes as:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Now, to find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes, we add the two numbers together:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

Initially, Amy had two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors. She also had three makeup sets, each with 6 colors, which totals \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors. Adding these together, Amy had \(8 + 18 = 26\) eyeshadow colors in total.

When her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains 4 colors, the number of colors left is \(26 - 4 = 22\).

Next, Amy uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of that is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. After using up 3 colors, the number of colors left from that makeup set is \(6 - 3 = 3\).

Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is \(22 + 3 = 25\).

So, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Mattison's height is 60 inches. The house is 7 times his height, so the total height of the house is:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is thrice Mattison's height, so its height is:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, the height of the second floor is:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as if it's the first time I'm tackling it.

First, we know that the total number of shells found by the twenty tourists is 700. Team Alphas found 40% of these shells. So, we calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas as follows:

\[
\text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280
\]

Next, we subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas from the total number of shells to find out how many are left:

\[
\text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420
\]

Then, team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. We calculate the number of shells found by team The finders as follows:

\[
\text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the remaining shells to find out how many shells team Gogetters found:

\[
\text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 420 - 252 = 168
\]

Therefore, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:

\[
\boxed{168}

"The average distance all four dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. We have the distances for the first three dogs: 1 mile, 4 miles, and 3 miles. Let's denote the distance the fourth dog needs to walk as \( x \).

The total distance walked by all four dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x \]

Given that the average distance is 3 miles, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{1 + 4 + 3 + x}{4} = 3 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12 \]
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 8 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. The correct answer is 4 miles."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan worth 40% of that, which is:

\[
0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. So, the amount used to pay off debts is:

\[
0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount:

\[
100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

Therefore, the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is:

\[
\boxed{40000}

   - The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.
   - The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms.

   Adding these weights together:
   \[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

2. **Determine the total cost of the tunas:**
   - A kilogram of tuna costs $0.50.
   - Therefore, the total cost is:

So, Deandre will earn **64 dollars** after selling all the tunas to the market."
"Sure, let me calculate the profit for you again as if this is the first time I'm doing it.

Trinity buys the magazines at $72 each and sells them at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of that price. To find the selling price, we calculate:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99
\]

So, the selling price is $99. Now, to find the profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27
\]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{27}

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier.

1. **Low setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the low setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the low setting: \(1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters}\).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day on the medium setting as on the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the medium setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting: \(2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters}\).

3. **High setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day on the high setting as on the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the high setting for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \(4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters}\).

Now, we sum the total water removed over all settings:
\[3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}\]

Therefore, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

2. **Next, we find the total amount of medicine in one dose:**
   - The total amount is the sum of the first and second medicines, which is \(14 + 42 = 56\) mL.

3. **Finally, we calculate the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:**
   - The total amount in 8 doses is \(8 \times 56 = 448\) mL.

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is \(\boxed{448}\) mL."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students. Each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class. Therefore, the capacity of one of John's classes is:

\[
\frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:

\[
2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Adding the capacities of Ali's class and John's classes gives us the combined capacity:

\[

"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start to ensure clarity.

Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. First, we calculate the total amount Stephen will return:

\[ \text{Total amount to return} = 300 + (300 \times 0.02) = 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, Stephen will pay $25 per month for the first 11 months. The total amount paid over these 11 months is:

\[ \text{Total paid over 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount paid over the first 11 months from the total amount to return:

"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the detailed calculation:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with side length 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine the difference between the true number and the estimated number:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[

"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start:

1. The bus initially has 20 people on board.
2. At the first stop, 40 more people board the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus becomes \(20 + 40 = 60\).
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who entered at the first stop board the bus. So, the number of people who enter at the second stop is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30\). Adding these to the current total, the bus now has \(60 + 30 = 90\) people.
4. At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubles. So, the bus now has \(90 \times 2 = 180\) people.
5. The bus has a total capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people can board the bus, we subtract the current number of people from the bus's capacity: \(200 - 180 = 20\).

Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Pauline spent on all her visits to the museum.

1. **Initial Cost per Visit:**
   The initial cost of one visit is $2.

2. **Cost per Visit After 5 Years:**
   The cost increased by 150%, so the increase is:
   \[
   2 \times 1.5 = 3
   \]
   Adding this increase to the original cost:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5
   \]
   So, the new cost per visit is $5.

3. **Total Number of Visits Over 8 Years:**
   Pauline visits the museum three times a year for 8 years:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   Therefore, she made 24 visits in total.

4. **Total Cost for the First 5 Years:**
   For the first 5 years, the cost per visit is $2:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10

"Sure, let's break down the problem again with a fresh perspective.

Cedar Falls Middle School has students in grades 4 through 7, and each year they aim to earn as many Accelerated Reader points as possible. The 10 students with the highest points in each grade get to participate in an escape room set up by the teachers. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, and they have 45 minutes to complete the challenge. 

To find out how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to determine how many groups of 8 students can be formed from the 30 students who qualify. 

First, we calculate the number of groups:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \left\lceil \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 3.75 \right\rceil = 4 \text{ groups} \]

Since each group takes 45 minutes to complete the escape room challenge, the total time required is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ \boxed{180} \]"

"Sure, let's tackle this problem step by step.

We have a board that is 40 feet long. We need to cut it into two pieces where the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece. Let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which gives us the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need.

First, we know that Aiden makes 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. He wants to make 80 meatballs. To find out how many pounds of ground beef he needs, we divide the number of meatballs he wants by the number of meatballs he gets from each pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of ground beef, the amount of seasoning required is:

\[
\text{Amount of seasoning} = \text{Pounds of ground beef} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Luke has five windows, each 35 inches wide. To find the total width of all the windows, we multiply the width of one window by the number of windows:

\[ 35 \text{ inches/window} \times 5 \text{ windows} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs to buy fabric that is 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the amount of fabric Luke should buy is 350 inches. 

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, I'll break it down into two segments based on the pricing structure provided.

1. For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute.
   \[
   \text{Cost for first 16 minutes} = 16 \times 0.25 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute.
   \[
   \text{Cost for remaining 20 minutes} = 20 \times 0.2 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost for the 36-minute call.
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4.00 + 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would:

1. On Monday, it rained 2 inches.
2. For Tuesday, the rain is expected to be 1 inch more than twice the amount of rain on Monday.
3. Twice the amount of rain on Monday is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) inches.
4. Adding 1 inch to that gives us \(4 + 1 = 5\) inches.

Therefore, the amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Sure, let's tackle the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Carly is making cupcakes and brownies for her art class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, we need to find out how many cupcakes Carly made.

First, let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as \( C \) and the number of brownies as \( B \).

According to the problem, the number of brownies is 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Since there are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. Let's verify the solution:

If \( C = 3 \), then:
\[ B = 3C - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \]

The total number of treats is:
\[ C + B = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

This matches the total number of treats needed. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

First, we calculate the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure:
- Cost of a basic manicure: $35
- Cost of a basic pedicure: $40

Adding these together gives:
\[
35 + 40 = 75
\]

The salon offers a 20% discount for getting both services. To find the discount amount:
\[
0.20 \times 75 = 15
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
75 - 15 = 60
\]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total, and each nail art service costs $3:
\[
10 \times 3 = 30
\]

Now, add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost of the manicure and pedicure:
\[
60 + 30 = 90
\]

So, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a clearer manner:

Susan has:
- 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year, so that's \(3 \times 12 = 36\) issues.
- 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.
- 1 last magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so that's \(4 \times 6 = 24\) issues.

Adding these up:
\[36 + 6 + 24 = 66\]

So, the total number of magazines Susan gets every year is 66. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer persona.

We know that Samantha has 27 paintings. According to the problem, Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we let the number of paintings Shelley has be \( S \), we can write:
\[ S - 12 = 27 \]

To find \( S \), we add 12 to both sides:
\[ S = 27 + 12 \]
\[ S = 39 \]

So, Shelley has 39 paintings. The problem also states that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. If we let the number of paintings Kim has be \( K \), we can write:
\[ S = K + 8 \]

Substituting the value of \( S \) we found:
\[ 39 = K + 8 \]

To find \( K \), we subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ K = 39 - 8 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Certainly! Let's break down the price changes step by step to find the final price of the toy.

1. **November Price:** The toy starts at $40.
2. **December Price Increase:** The price increases by 80%. To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40:
   \[
   0.80 \times 40 = 32
   \]
   Adding this increase to the original price:
   \[
   40 + 32 = 72
   \]
   So, the price in December is $72.
3. **January Price Decrease:** The price decreases by 50%. To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72:
   \[
   0.50 \times 72 = 36
   \]
   Subtracting this decrease from the December price:
   \[
   72 - 36 = 36
   \]
   Therefore, the price in January is $36.

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour. So, the total for these lessons is:

\[
4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars}
\]

For the 2 lessons given to veterans, he charges 25% less than the standard rate. The reduced rate is:

\[
80 \times (1 - 0.25) = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

So, the total for the veteran lessons is:

\[
2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the amounts from both types of lessons gives us the total for the day:

\[
320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

\[
\boxed{440}
\]"
"Sure, let's calculate Sally's mean score again with a fresh approach.

To find the mean score, we need to sum all the scores and then divide by the number of scores. The scores Sally received are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

First, let's sum these scores:
\[
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630
\]

Next, we count the number of scores. There are 9 scores in total.

Now, we calculate the mean by dividing the sum of the scores by the number of scores:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{630}{9} = 70
\]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some away, she is left with \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the original amount, which is \(20 \times \frac{1}{4} = 5\) pomelos. To find out how many pomelos she gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original number: \(20 - 5 = 15\).

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos. The correct answer is:

15"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them, which is:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, the number of apples left after eating is:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. 25% of 36 is:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

After giving 9 apples to his sister, the number of apples left is:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Finally, he sold these 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total money he received is:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the amount of money Walter received is:

\[
\boxed{81}

"Sure, let me solve this for you.

Given that 9 novels are 3 quarters of the number of novels Regina has written this year, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} x \]

To find \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 4:

\[ 9 \times 4 = 3x \]
\[ 36 = 3x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{36}{3} \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Michael is traveling at an average speed of 50 km/hr for 3 days. We need to find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) he has covered.

First, we calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days. Since he travels continuously for 3 days, and there are 24 hours in a day, the total time he travels is:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Given his speed is 50 km/hr, the total distance he travels in 72 hours is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Now, to find out what percentage of the total distance (6000 km) this distance (3600 km) represents, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:
\[ 60\% \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{60} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many grapes were at the beginning.

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which means he used \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes.
4. Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. So, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.
5. Since the remaining grapes after her brother used his share are used to make the pies, we can set up the equation: the total number of grapes at the beginning minus the grapes used by Madeline and her brother equals the grapes used to make the pies. Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning is \(48 + 36 = 84\) grapes.

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{84}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

To find out how many teachers were at school, we subtract the number of sick teachers from the total and then add the substitute teachers:

Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 69 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 78

So, the number of teachers at school that day is 78.

The correct answer is 78."
"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we start by calculating the weekly cost. 

- The pasta costs $1.00 per box.
- The cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- The gruyere cheese costs twice the cheddar cheese, which is $6.00.

Adding these costs together gives us the weekly cost:
\[ 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00 \]

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the weekly cost is $10.00. To find the annual cost, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year, which is 52:
\[ 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[
\boxed{520.00}
\]"
"To determine the percentage of their day that the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we first calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Each classroom takes 15 minutes, so for 80 classrooms:

\[ 80 \times 15 = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total cleaning time into hours since the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their 8-hour workday is spent cleaning classrooms, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

Therefore, on average, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms. However, this percentage is not practical in the context of a workday, as it exceeds 100%. This result indicates that the custodian spends more than one full workday cleaning the classrooms in the given 5 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 250\% \]"
"Sure, let me refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima. Here’s the detailed breakdown:

1. **Determine the capacity of each shelf:**
   - Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
   - The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
   - The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

2. **Calculate the total capacity of one bookcase:**
   - The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves.
   - Total capacity = capacity of bottom shelf + capacity of middle shelf + capacity of middle shelf + capacity of top shelf
   - Total capacity = \(20 + 10 + 10 + 15 = 55\) books.

3. **Determine the number of bookcases needed:**
   - Elly has 110 books.
   - To find out how many bookcases are needed, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase.
   - Number of bookcases needed = \(\frac{110}{55} = 2\).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, which is 60 eggs. Each dozen costs $2.40, so the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. Since she has 60 eggs, the number of sets of 3 eggs she has is:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

If each set is sold for $1, the total selling price is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and costs $18.00 per bag. If the store is offering a $3.00 discount on a bag, the price of the bag becomes $15.00. 

Now, to find out how much each stick costs, we divide the discounted price by the number of sticks in the bag:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since we need the cost per stick in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, the cost per stick of jerky in cents is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we start by calculating the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test. The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct. So, we calculate:

\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

This means Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test. Now, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test to meet the requirement of answering 70% of the total questions correctly. The total number of questions on both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to answer 70% of these 110 questions correctly. We calculate 70% of 110:

\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

So, Audrey needs to get 77 questions correct in total. Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade. The correct answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Mary makes some strawberry cubes, and the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. The total number of ice cubes is 116.

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \). Then the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) can be expressed as:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting \( B \) in the total equation:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying this:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

The final numerical answer is:

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - To sell 15 cars, the number of customers needed is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, he needs to round up to the next whole number, which is 8 customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - To get 8 customers, the number of telephone calls needed is:

     \]

2. **Number of Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each.
   - Half of 8 rooms is:
     \[
     \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ rooms}
     \]
   - For the 4 rooms with 4 small candles each:
     \[
     4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ candles per room} = 16 \text{ small candles}
     \]
   - For the 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each:
     \[
     4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ candles per room} = 20 \text{ medium candles}

"To find out how long it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, we'll break down the time taken for each side:

1. **First side:** It takes 5 minutes.
2. **Second side:** Since it's twice as long as the first side, it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. **Third side:** Similarly, it also takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
4. **Fourth side:** This side takes half the time of the first side, so it's \(0.5 \times 5 = 2.5\) minutes.
5. **Fifth side:** Just like the fourth side, it also takes \(0.5 \times 5 = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, we add up the times for all sides:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Tim works 6 hours each day, and there are 5 days in a work week. So, the total hours he works in a week is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Given that it takes him 15 minutes to handle one call, we can find out how many calls he can handle in a week by dividing the total minutes by the time it takes to handle one call:

\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

Therefore, the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week is:

\[ 120 \]"
"Certainly, let's break it down step by step.

For the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry. So for 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(7 \times 6 = 42\) minutes.

For the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry. So for 6 paintings, the total drying time would be \(12 \times 6 = 72\) minutes.

Now, to find out how much longer it will take with the new varnish, we subtract the old varnish time from the new varnish time: \(72 - 42 = 30\) minutes.

Therefore, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a way that fits my persona, Fatima.

Crista has 20 plants in total. Here's how we can figure out the daily water requirement:

- 4 plants need half a cup of water each day.
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water each day.
- The remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water each day.

First, let's calculate the water needed for the first two groups:
- For the 4 plants needing half a cup each: \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups.
- For the 8 plants needing 1 cup each: \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups.

Now, we need to find out how many plants are left:
- Total plants: 20
- Plants needing half a cup: 4
- Plants needing 1 cup: 8
- Remaining plants: \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\)

These 8 remaining plants need a quarter of a cup each:
- For the 8 plants needing a quarter cup each: \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups.

Now, let's add up the total water needed:
- Water for half a cup plants: 2 cups
- Water for 1 cup plants: 8 cups
- Water for quarter cup plants: 2 cups

Total water needed: \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups.

So, Crista needs \(\boxed{12}\) cups of water every day for her plants."
"Sure, let's break down the problem again with a fresh perspective.

Phineas needs to travel a total of 200 yards to return home, with half of the distance being on land and the other half in water. That means he needs to hop 100 yards on land and swim 100 yards in water.

For the hop on land, his speed is 20 yards per minute. So, the time it takes to hop 100 yards is:
\[ \text{Time for hop} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

For the swim in water, his speed is 10 yards per minute. So, the time it takes to swim 100 yards is:
\[ \text{Time for swim} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding these times together gives the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Phineas to return home is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know the main phone costs $20, and it costs twice as much as each additional phone. So, if the main phone costs $20, then each additional phone costs $10.

Since there are five phones in total and one of them is the main phone, there are four additional phones. The cost for the four additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Adding the cost of the main phone to the cost of the additional phones, we get:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the whole phone plan is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
2. Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.**

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we can calculate the number of doughnuts made per day as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total revenue from selling all the doughnuts.**

Each doughnut is sold for $2. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 3600 doughnuts is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June if he sells all the doughnuts is:
\[ \boxed{7200} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem again from the start to ensure clarity.

Jade has taken a total of 210 photos. She plans to upload these photos in batches of 7 photos each day, and she uploads 6 such batches each day. We need to find out how many days it will take her to upload all her photos.

First, let's calculate how many photos she uploads in one day:
- She uploads 6 batches per day.
- Each batch contains 7 photos.

So, the number of photos uploaded per day is:
\[
6 \text{ batches/day} \times 7 \text{ photos/batch} = 42 \text{ photos/day}
\]

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos:
\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, Jade will need \(\boxed{5}\) days to upload all of her photos."
"Certainly, let's break down the calculation again to find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

For one week, the cost is calculated as follows:
- Cost for blouses: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 \text{ per blouse} = \$25.00\)
- Cost for pants: \(2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 \text{ per pair} = \$16.00\)
- Cost for skirt: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 \text{ per skirt} = \$6.00\)

Adding these up gives the total weekly cost:
\[
\$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00
\]

To find the total cost for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
\[
5 \times \$47.00 = \$235.00
\]

Therefore, Alicia spends \(\boxed{235.00}\) on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step with a focus on clarity and precision.

John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed increases to 2.5 times his normal speed:

\[ 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Each page has 450 words, so for 10 pages, the total number of words is:

\[ 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

To find out how long it takes to speak 4500 words at a speed of 375 WPM, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} \]

Performing the division:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

Therefore, the time it takes for John to speak 10 pages at his new speed is 12 minutes. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again from the start.

1. **First Day:**
   Conor found 50 people at the beach.

2. **Second Day:**
   The number of people on the second day was 20 more than on the first day.
   \[
   \text{Number of people on the second day} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

3. **Third Day:**
   The number of people on the third day was twice the number on the second day.
   \[
   \text{Number of people on the third day} = 2 \times 70 = 140
   \]

4. **Average Number of People for the Rest of the Week:**
   Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (which includes the fourth, fifth, and sixth days).

5. **Total Number of People for the Rest of the Week:**
   Since there are 3 days left in the week and the average is 60 people per day:
   \[
   \text{Total number of people for the rest of the week} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

6. **Total Number of People for the Entire Week:**
   Adding the number of people from the first three days to the total number of people for the rest of the week:
   \[
   \text{Total number of people for the week} = 50 + 70 + 140 + 180 = 440
   \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[
\boxed{440}
\]"
"Certainly, let's break down the problem again to ensure clarity and accuracy.

1. **Initial 30 seconds:**
   - 20 kernels pop.

2. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate triples the initial rate.
   - Number of kernels popping = \(3 \times 20 = 60\).

3. **Next 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate quadruples the initial rate.
   - Number of kernels popping = \(4 \times 20 = 80\).

4. **Final 30 seconds:**
   - The popping rate halves the previous rate.
   - Number of kernels popping = \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\).

Now, let's sum up the total number of kernels that popped initially:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Adding these to the initial total:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Thus, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice. So, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice in total. Additionally, he needs to make an extra gallon that is twice as tart, which means it also requires 1 cup of lemon juice.

So, the total lemon juice needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups} \]

Since each cup of lemon juice requires 6 lemons, the total number of lemons needed is:
\[ 5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, the number of lemons Tim will need is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as if I'm Fatima.

First, we have 3 German Shepherds, and each consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the total daily consumption for the German Shepherds is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we have 2 Bulldogs, and each consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the total daily consumption for the Bulldogs is:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ kg} \]

Adding these together gives us the total daily consumption for all the dogs:
\[ 15 \text{ kg} + 6 \text{ kg} = 21 \text{ kg} \]

To find out how much dog food they need in a week, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
\[ 21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 147 \text{ kg} \]

So, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is:
\[ \boxed{147} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as if this is the first time I'm tackling the problem.

First, we have 10 animals that are 2-legged. Each of these animals has 2 legs, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ legs} \]

Next, we have 15 animals that are 4-legged. Each of these animals has 4 legs, so the total number of legs from these animals is:
\[ 15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of animals together:
\[ 20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs} \]

To find out how many pairs of legs there are, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know the tower consists of:
- 4 blue blocks
- Twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, which means 8 yellow blocks
- An unknown number of red blocks, which we'll call \( R \)

The total number of blocks is 32. So, we can write the equation:

\[ 4 \text{ (blue blocks)} + 8 \text{ (yellow blocks)} + R \text{ (red blocks)} = 32 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is 20. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the net distance he traveled after his journey.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- Elvis drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- Elvis drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:
54"
"Certainly, let's break down the depreciation step by step to find the value of the boat after three years.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Therefore, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

We start with a total of 232 individually wrapped Starbursts candies. We know there are 54 red candies. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so that's 108 orange candies. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, which means there are 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[ 54 \text{ (red)} + 108 \text{ (orange)} + 27 \text{ (yellow)} = 189 \]

To find out how many candies are pink, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[ 232 - 189 = 43 \]

So, the number of pink candies is 43. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{43}\)."

\[ 3 \times 80 = \$240 \]

Next, the cost of one bus trip is 10% of the hotel cost, which is:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = \$8 \]

Since Helen rode the bus 7 times, the total cost for the bus trips is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = \$56 \]

Adding the total cost for the hotel and the total cost for the bus trips gives:
\[ 240 + 56 = \$296 \]

Therefore, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step as Fatima would.

John invited 20 people to a birthday party, and each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs from a previous party. Therefore, the number of additional hot dogs he needs to buy is:

\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack contains 6 hot dogs, and each pack costs $2. To find out how many packs he needs to buy, we divide the number of additional hot dogs by the number of hot dogs per pack:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Since each pack costs $2, the total cost for the packs is:

\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount John needs to spend on hot dogs is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"Sure, let me calculate this again from scratch.

First, I'll calculate the total revenue from selling cupcakes and cookies:
- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so that's \(20 \times 2 = \$40\).
- She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so that's \(40 \times 1 = \$40\).
- Therefore, the total revenue is \(40 + 40 = \$80\).

Next, I'll calculate the total cost of the five trays of cookies:
- Each tray costs $4, so for five trays, it's \(5 \times 4 = \$20\).

Now, to find out how much money Frances has left, I subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
- So, \(80 - 20 = \$60\).

Thus, the final amount of money Frances has left is \$60."

Additionally, he finds seven dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, seven dimes would be:
\[ 7 \times 10 = 70 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add up all the cents:
\[ 25 \text{ cents (quarter)} + 10 \text{ cents (nickels)} + 70 \text{ cents (dimes)} = 105 \text{ cents} \]

So, the total amount of money James has is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"To find the total age of all the siblings, let's break it down:

- There are 3 sisters, and each is 16 years old. So, the total age of the sisters is \(3 \times 16 = 48\) years.
- One of the brothers is 12 years old. The older brother is twice that age, so he is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) years old. Therefore, the total age of the brothers is \(12 + 24 = 36\) years.

Adding the total ages of the sisters and the brothers together, we get \(48 + 36 = 84\) years.

So, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years."
"Sure, let me calculate this again as if it's the first time I'm doing it.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, which totals 30 minutes per day. She does this 5 days a week, so her weekly meditation time is 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes/week. Over 4 weeks, her total meditation time is 150 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 600 minutes.

She practices yoga for 1 hour (60 minutes) each day, and she does this 5 days a week, so her weekly yoga time is 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes/week. Over 4 weeks, her total yoga time is 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

Adding the total time spent on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks, we get 600 minutes + 1200 minutes = 1800 minutes. Converting this to hours, 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours.

So, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation and yoga practice over 4 weeks is 30 hours."
"Certainly! Let's break it down again to ensure we get the total square footage of the quilt correctly.

1. **Small t-shirts:**
   - Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 11 small t-shirts.
   - Total square footage from small t-shirts: \( 11 \times 3 = 33 \) square feet.

2. **Medium t-shirts:**
   - Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 8 medium t-shirts.
   - Total square footage from medium t-shirts: \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \) square feet.

3. **Large t-shirts:**
   - Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 6 large t-shirts.
   - Total square footage from large t-shirts: \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) square feet.

Now, we sum up the square footage from all the t-shirts:
\[ 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 \]

Therefore, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet.

The final numerical answer is:
101"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a way that feels more natural to me.

A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds, we calculate:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

Adding this to the number of seeds in a small sunflower gives the number of seeds in a large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds from one small sunflower and one large sunflower:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with the persona of Fatima.

Given that George has 18 pens, and Timothy has three times the number of pens George has, we can calculate the number of pens Timothy has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times 18 = 54
\]

Next, since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can find the number of pens Sarah has by dividing the number of pens Timothy has by 2:

\[
\text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, the number of pens Sarah has is:

\[
\boxed{27}

"To find out how tall Jackie was before the summer, we start by determining her current height. Since she grew 3 inches over the summer and is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, who is twice as tall as Albert, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate Anne's height: Albert is 36 inches tall, so Anne, being twice as tall, is \(2 \times 36 = 72\) inches tall.
2. Determine Jackie's current height: Since Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, her current height is \(72 - 2 = 70\) inches.
3. Calculate Jackie's height before the summer: Since she grew 3 inches over the summer, her height before the summer was \(70 - 3 = 67\) inches.

Therefore, Jackie's height before the summer was 67 inches. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{67} \]"
"To find out how much money the company will receive for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bars produced in one day, which is 5000 bars.
2. Determine the number of bars produced in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the company produces \(5000 \times 7 = 35000\) bars in a week.
3. For two weeks, the company will produce \(35000 \times 2 = 70000\) bars.
4. If each bar is sold for $2, the total revenue from selling 70000 bars is \(70000 \times 2 = 140000\) dollars.

Therefore, the company will receive \(\boxed{140000}\) dollars for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to ensure clarity.

First, we calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal. Each T-shirt originally costs $8. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he gets the second T-shirt at a 50% discount.

The cost of the first T-shirt is $8.
The cost of the second T-shirt at 50% off is $8 * 0.5 = $4.

So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, we calculate the cost of the shoes after a 40% discount. The original price of the shoes is $40. A 40% discount means Jake pays 60% of the original price.

The discounted price of the shoes is $40 * 0.6 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends.

Total amount spent = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.

Therefore, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step with a clearer persona.

Ryan earns $6 for each week he completes his chores. Over 3 weeks, he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

He then spends money on ice cream cones. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, and he buys 4 ice cream cones (one for himself and three for his friends):

\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the ice cream cones, the amount of money Ryan has left is:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ryan wants to buy movie tickets, and each ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with his remaining $13, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ \frac{13}{6.5} = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Ellen spent:
- $100 on leggings
- $5 on a photo frame

So, Ellen's total is $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani spent:
- $30 on sunglasses
- $100 each on two bathrobes, which totals $100 * 2 = $200

So, Lani's total is $30 + $200 = $230.

Adding both totals together:
$105 (Ellen's total) + $230 (Lani's total) = $335.

Therefore, the total amount they spent in all is $335."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix.

First, we calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * 6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * 8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * 10 = $20

Adding these costs together gives the total cost for one jar:
\[ 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[ 44 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 500 \text{ dollars} - 440 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"Sure, let's calculate the total dollar amount in the jar again with a fresh perspective.

1. **Quarters:**
   - Justin has 32 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total value of quarters = \( 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \) dollars.

2. **Dimes:**
   - Justin has 95 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes = \( 95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \) dollars.

3. **Nickels:**
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels = \( 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Pennies:**
   - Justin has 750 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies = \( 750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \) dollars.

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Janet spent:
- $3.50 on ice cream
- $7.50 for a movie ticket for herself
- $7.50 for a movie ticket for her younger sister
- $8.50 on a bracelet

First, we calculate the total amount spent on movie tickets:
\[ 7.50 + 7.50 = 15.00 \]

Next, we add the cost of the ice cream and the bracelet to the total spent on movie tickets:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount spent from $40:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the amount Janet has left is $13.00."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

Josh runs his car shop and services 3 cars a day. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday. This means he is open for 5 days a week. He gets paid $4 per car. 

First, let's calculate how many cars he services in a week:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

Next, we calculate his weekly earnings:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers. He's selling them to a buyer who will pay $5 per toy for half of his collection and $7 per toy for the other half. 

First, we split his collection into two equal parts:
- Half of his collection is 6 toy soldiers.
- The other half is also 6 toy soldiers.

Now, we calculate the earnings from each half:
- For the first half (6 toy soldiers at $5 each):
  \[
  6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- For the second half (6 toy soldiers at $7 each):
  \[
  6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ dollars}

"Sure, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many weeks it takes for Nate to fill in all the holes.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = \( 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \).

2. **Determine the net change in the number of holes per day:**
   - Nate's dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - Net change per day = \( 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of days required to fill all the holes:**
   - Total holes = 84.
   - Net change per day = 3 holes.
   - Total days required = \( \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \).

4. **Convert the total number of days into weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total weeks required = \( \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \).

Therefore, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The correct answer is:

"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School.

First, we know that Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students each year. Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School. To find the enrollment at Butler High School, we calculate:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

"Sure, let's refine the response while adopting the persona of Fatima.

Dr. Hugo Grumpus and his assistant, Igor, were preparing for a laboratory experiment. Dr. Grumpus instructed Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes and place them all on the lab bench. By mistake, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, and he picked up the correct number of beakers. Igor ended up with a total of 29 items on the lab bench. How many beakers did Igor lose?

First, let's calculate the number of test tubes Igor gathered:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so Igor gathered half of that, which is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.

Next, let's determine the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, so Igor gathered 2 more than that, which is \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.

Since Igor gathered the correct number of beakers, he gathered 7 beakers.

Now, let's calculate the total number of items Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16
- Total gathered: \( 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \) items.

The total number of items requested was:
- Test tubes: 16
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 14
- Total requested: \( 16 + 7 + 14 = 37 \) items.

Since Igor gathered 31 items and there were 37 items requested, he must have lost:
- \( 37 - 31 = 6 \) items.

Given that Igor gathered 7 beakers and lost a total of 6 items, he must have lost 1 beaker.

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

James is assembling 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs. Each leg needs 2 screws. So, the total number of screws needed for one table is:
\[ 4 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Since he is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, the number of screws James will have left over is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first one, which means it has \(2 \times 10 = 20\) eggs.

To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we add the eggs from both baskets together:
\[10 + 20 = 30\]

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30. 

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step again to find the total amount of money raised by the girls.

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each person to find the total amount raised:

\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

Let's calculate the total:

\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long Vanessa took to complete her part of the race.

First, we know that Aaron ran each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. If we let Vanessa's speed be \( V \) miles per minute, then Aaron's speed is \( 2V \) miles per minute.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and ran a distance of \( 32V \) miles (since his speed is \( 2V \) and he took 16 minutes), we can deduce that Vanessa ran 4 miles.

Since Aaron and Vanessa are partners and they ran the same total distance, the total distance they ran together is \( 32V + 4 \) miles. Given that Aaron's speed is \( 2V \) and he took 16 minutes, we can calculate the time Vanessa took to run her 4 miles.

Vanessa's speed is \( V \) miles per minute, so the time she took to run 4 miles is:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{V \text{ miles per minute}} \]

Since Aaron's speed is \( 2V \) and he took 16 minutes, we can find \( V \) by using the total distance they ran together:

\[ 32V + 4 = \text{Total distance} \]

But we only need to find the time Vanessa took, which is:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{4}{V} \]

Given that Aaron's speed is \( 2V \) and he took 16 minutes, we can deduce that \( V = 8 \) miles per minute. Therefore:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 0.5 minutes to complete her part of the race. Converting this to a more standard format:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = 0.5 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how much more line the caretaker needs to buy, we start by calculating the total line required for the 200 feet of dock. Since he needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the 6 feet of new line that he already has from the total required line:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy an additional 594 feet of line. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 594 \]"

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine per reservation. To find out how much they make in a week if they are open 2 days a week, we can break it down step by step.

1. **Number of reservations per night:** 6 reservations.
2. **Number of reservations per day:** Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the number of reservations per day is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ reservations/night}}{2 \text{ nights/day}} = 3 \text{ reservations/day}
   \]
3. **Total number of reservations per week:** 
   \[
   3 \text{ reservations/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]
4. **Cost per reservation:** Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. The total cost per reservation is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. **Total revenue per week:** Multiply the number of reservations per week by the cost per reservation:
   \[
   21 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 315 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a more conversational manner.

The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He made a 25% profit on the cost price. To find the total selling price, we first calculate the profit amount:

\[ \text{Profit} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:

\[ \text{Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. James is currently twice as old as his sister Dora. Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old.
2. Therefore, James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.
3. Since James is 19 years older than his father John, John is currently \(18 - 19 = -1\) years old, which is incorrect. Let's correct this: John is actually 18 years older than James, so John is \(18 + 19 = 37\) years old.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.
5. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

The final numerical answer is 8."
"Certainly, let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour.

First, we determine how many oranges each person can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in 60 minutes (which is one hour):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step as Fatima would.

The original cost of a new radiator is $400. Mark gets it at 80% off, which means he pays only 20% of the original cost. So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:

\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator, which takes 3 hours at $50 per hour. The cost for the mechanic's work is:

\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Adding the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's work together gives:

\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is:

\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We have 20 animals in total, and they have 70 legs altogether. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Let's denote the number of chickens as \( C \) and the number of cows as \( K \).

From the information given, we can write two equations:
1. \( C + K = 20 \) (total number of animals)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \) (total number of legs)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices, and there are 7 pizzas. So, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to share these 56 slices equally among the 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each of them can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
