"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day.
2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so that leaves:
   \[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]
3. She also uses 4 eggs to make muffins, so that leaves:
   \[ 13 - 4 = 9 \]
4. Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. So, she makes:
   \[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]
   
Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. The answer is $18."
"To find out how many bolts of fiber are needed for the robe, we need to add the blue fiber and the white fiber together.

- The robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- It needs half as much white fiber as blue fiber, so it needs \(2 \div 2 = 1\) bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the blue and white fiber together:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt

So, the total number of bolts needed is:
\[2 + 1 = 3\]

Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is 3. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Josh buys a house for $80,000 and then spends $50,000 on repairs. So, the total cost is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The house's value increases by 150%. To find out how much that is, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

To find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract the original cost from the new value:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is $195,000.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, in one session (which he does 3 times a week), he runs:
\[ 3 \text{ sprints/session} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 180 \text{ meters/session} \]

Since he does this 3 times a week, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Wendi has 20 chickens, and she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed every day. So, for all the chickens, she needs:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is left for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.

The answer is: \boxed{20}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. For every second glass, he pays less. The first glass costs $5. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

So, for every pair of glasses:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- So, the total cost for one pair of glasses is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will have 8 pairs of glasses. So, the total cost will be:
- 8 pairs × $8 per pair = $64.

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for 16 glasses. The answer is \boxed{64}."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm in primary school.

1. We know Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we multiply 20 by 4:
   \[
   20 \times 4 = 80
   \]
   So, Charleston has 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we multiply 80 by 2:
   \[
   80 \times 2 = 160
   \]
   So, Toulouse has 160 sheep.
4. Now, to find out how many sheep there are in total, we add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse:
   \[
   20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260.

The correct answer is: **260**"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Carla is downloading a big file that's 200 GB. She can download 2 GB every minute.

First, she downloads 40% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 80 GB. At 2 GB per minute, it takes her 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes to download 80 GB.

Then, Windows makes her stop to update, and that takes 20 minutes.

After the update, she has to start downloading the file from the beginning again. She has 120 GB left to download (200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB). At 2 GB per minute, it takes her 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes to download the rest.

So, the total time is 40 minutes (first part) + 20 minutes (update) + 60 minutes (second part) = 120 minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is 120 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step like I'm explaining to a primary school student.

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. To find out how far he goes, we multiply the time by the speed:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles} \]

Then, he spends 2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph. For the traffic, he doesn't move, so that's 0 miles. For the 0.5 hours at 30 mph:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

After that, he drives for the remaining time at 80 mph. He has 1.5 hours left:
\[ 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add up all the distances:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles} \]

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 315 miles from home."
"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular hours:
- Eliza worked 40 hours at a rate of $10 per hour.
- So, her earnings for these 40 hours are 40 * $10 = $400.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for the overtime hours:
- Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
- Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.
- So, her earnings for these 5 hours are 5 * $12 = $60.

Now, let's add the earnings from regular hours and overtime hours to find her total earnings for the week:
- Total earnings = $400 (from regular hours) + $60 (from overtime) = $460.

So, Eliza earned $460 this week. The correct answer is $460."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

In the first month, the program got 60 downloads.

In the second month, it got three times as many as the first month, so:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30%. So, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract it from 180:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \]
\[ 180 - 54 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Toula bought different types of pastries and we need to find out how much she spent in total. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Donuts:**
   - She bought 3 dozen donuts.
   - Each dozen costs $68.
   - So, 3 dozen would be \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

2. **Mini cupcakes:**
   - She bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
   - Each dozen costs $80.
   - So, 2 dozen would be \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

3. **Mini cheesecakes:**
   - She bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
   - Each dozen costs $55.
   - So, 6 dozen would be \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Donuts: $204
- Mini cupcakes: $160
- Mini cheesecakes: $330

Adding these together:
\[ 204 + 160 + 330 = 694 \]

So, the total cost is $694."
"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to look at the costs and the money he makes each year.

First, let's see how much money Carlos makes each year. He gets 7 lemons each year, and each lemon sells for $1.5. So, the money he makes each year from selling lemons is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \]

Next, we need to account for the cost of watering and feeding the tree, which is $3 each year. So, the net money he makes each year after paying for the water and feed is:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for him to make back the $90 he spent to plant the tree. We do this by dividing the cost of planting by the net money he makes each year:
\[ \frac{\$90}{\$7.5 \text{ per year}} = 12 \text{ years} \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree. The answer is 12 years."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So if she started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) and had \( \frac{2x}{3} \) left.

Then she sold 2 more at the red house. So now she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) left.

After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) and had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) left.

We know she ended up with 5 vacuum cleaners. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The answer is 18."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way:

1. First, we find out how many students are in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is 4 students.
2. After those 4 students are done with contemporary dance, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left.
3. Next, we find out how many of the remaining 16 students are in jazz dance. 25% of 16 is 4 students.
4. So, after those 4 students are done with jazz dance, we have 16 - 4 = 12 students left.
5. The rest of the students, 12, are in hip-hop dance.

To find out what percentage 12 is out of 20, we do:
\[ \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, 60% of the students are in hip-hop dance. The answer is 60%."
"To decide which purchase to make, let's look at how much each item will be worth after the market increases.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Future value = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
   - Profit from jewelry = Future value - Current value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Future value = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value - Current value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Now, let's compare the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The higher profit comes from buying the jewelry. So, the merchant should buy the jewelry to maximize profit.

The final answer is: Jewelry"
"To find the total distance covered by each train, we need to add the distances traveled in both directions.

1. The train travels 80 miles westward.
2. The train also travels 150 miles northward.

Now, we add these two distances together:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles.

The correct answer is: **230 miles**"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to add up how much she earns from teaching and coaching.

First, let's calculate her teaching earnings:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her annual teaching hours are 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year.
Her annual teaching earnings are 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year.

Next, let's calculate her coaching earnings:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her annual coaching hours are 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year.
Her annual coaching earnings are 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year.

Now, we add her teaching and coaching earnings to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step:

1. Claire uses 3 eggs every day.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses \(3 \times 7 = 21\) eggs.
3. In 4 weeks, she uses \(21 \times 4 = 84\) eggs.
4. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we need to find out how many dozens are in 84 eggs. To do this, we divide 84 by 12: \(84 \div 12 = 7\).

So, Claire eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks. The answer is 7."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Marissa has a 12-mile trail.
2. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles.
3. She took another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
4. So far, she has walked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles in 2 hours.
5. She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.
6. To find out how long she wants to spend hiking in total, we use the formula: total time = total distance / average speed.
7. Total time = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.
8. She has already spent 2 hours, so she has 1 hour left to walk the remaining distance.
9. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.
10. To find her required speed for the remaining distance, we use the formula: speed = distance / time.
11. Required speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

So, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The answer is 6 miles per hour."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We start with 10 liters of orange drink. Two-thirds of this is water.
   - So, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
     \]

2. We also have 15 liters of pineapple drink. Three-fifths of this is water.
   - So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. When we mix these two drinks, the total amount of water is:
   \[
   6.67 + 9 = 15.67 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. But we spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so we only have:
   \[
   10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
   \]

5. The total amount of water (15.67 liters) stays the same, but it's now in 9 liters of the mixture.

6. To find out how much water is in the 9 liters, we divide the total water by the total volume:
   \[
   \frac{15.67}{9} \approx 1.74 \text{ liters per liter}
   \]

7. So, in 9 liters, the amount of water is:
   \[
   9 \times 1.74 = 15.66 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters is approximately 15.66 liters. The closest option to this is 15.67 liters.

The final answer is: **15.67 liters**"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Samantha is 31 years old now.
2. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.
3. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old.
4. To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we subtract Raymond's age when his son was born from his current age: 25 - 23 = 2 years.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. The answer is 2."
"Sure, let's break it down simply:

Billy had 8 customers on Tuesday. Here's how many DVDs each group of customers bought:

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD. So, \(3 \times 1 = 3\) DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs. So, \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs.

Now, let's add them up:
- DVDs from the first 3 customers: 3 DVDs
- DVDs from the next 2 customers: 4 DVDs
- DVDs from the last 3 customers: 0 DVDs

So, the total number of DVDs sold is \(3 + 4 + 0 = 7\).

Therefore, the number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to figure out how long the candle burns and then use the rate of melting.

1. First, let's see how long the candle burns:
   - From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

2. Now, we know the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. So, if it burns for 4 hours, we can calculate the total melting as follows:
   - 2 centimeters per hour times 4 hours equals 8 centimeters.

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To find the original price of the book, we know that Kyle paid $19.50 after a 25% discount. This means he paid 75% of the original price. Let's call the original price \( P \).

So, we have:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to divide $19.50 by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Let's break down the costs step by step to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered.

First, we calculate the cost of the items Marie bought except for the pizza:
- One chicken meal costs $12.
- Five packs of milk cost $3 each, so \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- Four apples cost $1.50 each, so \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these costs together:
\[
12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[
50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[
\frac{17}{8.50} = 2
\]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to add up the cost of all the shorts, pants, and shoes she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- So, the total cost for the shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $59.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- So, the total cost for the pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- So, the total cost for the shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.00.

Finally, we add up the costs of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00

Adding these amounts:
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent a total of $253.00 on all the clothing items.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{253}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. In 60 days, she will eat 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton of ice cream has 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total servings by the servings in a carton:
\[ 60 \div 15 = 4 \]
So, she needs 4 cartons of ice cream.

Each carton costs $4.00. To find out how much she spends, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost of each carton:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \]
So, she will spend $16 on ice cream in 60 days.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Henry's trip is 60 miles long. He stops after 20 miles, so that's his first stop. Then he stops 15 miles before the end of the trip. To find out where his second stop is, we count back 15 miles from the end of the trip:

60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles

So, his second stop is at 45 miles. Now, to find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from his second stop:

45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops. The answer is 25 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Gloria has two pairs of high heels. One pair costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, which is $66. So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:

\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

The problem says that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if we let the cost of the boots be \( B \), then:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Now, let's add these numbers:

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost $104. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio 7:11, and their total age is 162.

First, we add the parts of the ratio together: 7 + 11 = 18.

This means for every 18 parts of age, Darrell has 7 parts and Allen has 11 parts.

To find out how many parts each part is, we divide the total age by the sum of the parts: 162 ÷ 18 = 9.

So, each part of the ratio represents 9 years.

Now, to find Allen's age, we multiply the number of parts he has by how many years each part represents: 11 × 9 = 99.

So, Allen's current age is 99 years.

To find out how old Allen will be 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109 years."
"To find the average guess, we first need to know what each friend guessed:

- The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.
- The second friend guessed 20 more than half of 80. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend guessed 60 jelly beans.
- The third friend guessed 25% more than 80. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend guessed 100 jelly beans.

Now, we add these guesses together: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. To find the average, we divide this sum by the number of guesses, which is 3:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans. The correct answer is 80."
"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week, we can do it step by step.

First, we know that each dog takes 0.5 hours a day to take care of. John has 10 dogs, so we calculate the total time for all dogs in one day:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we know there are 7 days in a week. So, to find out how many hours John spends in a week, we multiply the daily hours by 7:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs. The answer is 35 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without the original answer.

We know Gretchen has 110 coins in total. The problem tells us there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. 

Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \). Then the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

If we add the number of silver coins and gold coins together, we get the total number of coins:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, to find out how many gold coins she has, we add 30 to the number of silver coins:
\[ 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The answer is 70."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know Raymond has 40 jewels. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, first, we find half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to 20 to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so we subtract 2 from 25:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the next 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.

First, we need to find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes. If he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, 25% more means he scores an extra 1 point (because 25% of 4 is 1). So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores 4 + 1 = 5 points.

Now, to find the total points, we add the points from both 20-minute periods:
4 points (first 20 minutes) + 5 points (second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

So, the total points Mike scored is 9."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. If yogurts are sold in packs of 4 for $5.00, we need to find out how many packs Terry will need for 30 days.

First, let's see how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
- Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
- So in 30 days, Terry eats \(2 \times 30 = 60\) yogurts.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of 4 yogurts Terry needs for 60 yogurts:
- Since each pack has 4 yogurts, Terry needs \(60 \div 4 = 15\) packs.

Each pack costs $5.00, so for 15 packs, Terry will spend:
- \(15 \times 5 = 75\) dollars.

So, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John has 13 lego sets and he sells each for $15. So, if he sells all 13 sets, he gets:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

He then buys 8 video games, each costing $20. So, the total cost for the video games is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. So, the money he has left is:
\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

But we know he actually has $5 left, so the $35 he has left is the money he had initially, which is the total amount he made from selling his lego sets.

Since he sold all 13 lego sets, he doesn't have any lego sets left.

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

John runs 60 miles in a week. He runs for 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he runs in a week is:
3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours

Now, to find out how fast he runs, we divide the total miles by the total hours:
60 miles ÷ 6 hours = 10 miles per hour

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The answer is 10 miles per hour."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. We also know that skipping is half as fast as running. So, if skipping is 3 miles per hour, running must be twice that, which is 6 miles per hour.

Next, we need to figure out how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is 6 hours, we can calculate:
- Time spent running = 1/3 of 6 hours = 2 hours
- Time spent walking = 2/3 of 6 hours = 4 hours

Now, we can find out how far she can run in 2 hours:
- Distance running = Running speed × Time spent running = 6 miles per hour × 2 hours = 12 miles

And how far she can walk in 4 hours:
- Distance walking = Walking speed × Time spent walking
- Walking speed is half of running speed, so it's 6 miles per hour / 2 = 3 miles per hour
- Distance walking = 3 miles per hour × 4 hours = 12 miles

So, the total distance she can travel is the sum of the distances she runs and walks:
- Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = 12 miles + 12 miles = 24 miles

But wait, the question asks for the distance in six hours, and we calculated the distances for different times. The correct total distance she can travel in six hours, based on the given times, is 24 miles.

So, the answer is 24 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2. Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 times 2, which is 8 years old.

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

The dragon can breathe fire up to 1000 feet away. Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. But when she holds the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, with the gemstone, she can throw it 400 feet x 3 = 1200 feet.

Now, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, and Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet. So, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin:

1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet.

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it with the javelin.

The answer is: 200 feet."
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

After the guests had eaten, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces the guests took, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ 26 \]

The correct answer is:

\[ \text{26} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know a bag of chips has 250 calories in 5 servings.
2. So, each serving has 250 calories ÷ 5 = 50 calories.
3. Your daily goal is 2000 calories, and you've already eaten 1800 calories.
4. So, you can eat 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories more today.
5. Since each serving has 50 calories, you can eat 200 ÷ 50 = 4 servings.
6. Each serving is 50 grams, so 4 servings = 4 × 50 = 200 grams.

So, you can eat 200 grams of chips today. The answer is 200 grams."
"Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles. If he makes 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax because 20 candles divided by 10 candles per pound equals 2 pounds.

The cost to make 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. If he sells each candle for $2.00, the total money he makes from selling 20 candles is 20 candles times $2.00 per candle, which equals $40.00.

To find the net profit, we subtract the cost from the total money made:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Charlie's net profit is $30.00. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. So, we need to find out how many more articles that is. 

First, we calculate 2/5 of 5:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \]

So, on Tuesday, she wrote 2 more articles than on Monday. That means she wrote:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles} \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, she wrote:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles} \]

Now, let's add up all the articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Each article takes 4 hours to write. So, the total time she spent writing is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours. The answer is 104."
"Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used 220 of them at work and had 23 left. To find out how many she bought, we need to add the 220 she used to the 23 she had left, and then subtract that from the 80 she started with.

So, we do:
\[ 80 - 23 = 57 \]
Then we add the 220 she used:
\[ 57 + 220 = 277 \]

But we need to find out how many she bought, which is the difference between what she started with and what she had left after using some:
\[ 80 - 23 = 57 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought is 57.

The correct answer is: **57**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. So, he bought 5 blue ties because:
\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought:
\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie. Since a blue tie costs $40, a red tie costs:
\[ \text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + (0.50 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

So, the total cost for the red ties is:
\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Now, to find out how much John spent in total on ties, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties:
\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, John spent a total of $800 on ties. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy got, we first need to change the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches per foot:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we know the wire is 48 inches long and each piece is 6 inches. To find out how many pieces she gets, we divide the total length by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire. The correct answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To find out how many units are unoccupied, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to know how many units are in the building. There are 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units.
   - So, the total number of units is \(15 \times 8 = 120\).

2. Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied.
   - So, the number of occupied units is \(3/4 \times 120 = 90\).

3. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.
   - So, the number of unoccupied units is \(120 - 90 = 30\).

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Lloyd's chickens make 252 eggs every day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can find out how many dozens of eggs he gets each day by dividing 252 by 12. 

\[ 252 \div 12 = 21 \text{ dozens} \]

Now, if he sells each dozen for $2, we can find out how much he makes in a day by multiplying the number of dozens by $2.

\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ dollars per day} \]

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by 7 (the number of days in a week).

\[ 42 \times 7 = 294 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week."
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour. If he travels from 1 to 4 PM, that's 3 hours. So, the distance to his destination is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, he travels back at 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to get back, we use the distance he traveled to get there, which is 30 miles, and his new speed of 6 mph:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes him 5 hours to get back. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Uriah needs to remove 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books he removes is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The correct answer is:

**15 toys**"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

First, we need to find out how much money the mechanic made on Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires, and each tire costs $60. So, for the truck tires, the mechanic made:
  \[ 6 \times 60 = 360 \]
- The mechanic also repaired 4 car tires, and each tire costs $40. So, for the car tires, the mechanic made:
  \[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \]
- Adding these together, the total money made on Thursday is:
  \[ 360 + 160 = 520 \]

**Friday:**
- The mechanic only repaired car tires, and each tire costs $40. So, for 12 car tires, the mechanic made:
  \[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money the mechanic made on Thursday compared to Friday. We do this by subtracting the Friday amount from the Thursday amount:
\[ 520 - 480 = 40 \]

So, the mechanic made $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the shelter. Now, their mom tells them that their other two cats, Patchy and Trixie, had some kittens too.

Patchy had three times as many kittens as the adopted ones. So, if the adopted kittens are 7, then Patchy had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Trixie had 12 kittens.

Now, to find out the total number of kittens, we add the adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens together:
\[7 + 21 + 12 = 40\]

So, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens in total. The correct answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Jean had 30 lollipops and ate 2, so she has 28 lollipops left. She wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2:

\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \]

So, Jean can fill 14 bags.

The answer is: 14"
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we first need to know how much it costs for one trip. A ticket costs $7 and popcorn costs $7, so the total cost for one trip is $7 + $7 = $14.

Peter has $42 to spend. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total money he has by the cost of one trip:
\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his $42.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to do a few simple steps:

1. First, we need to know how much weight the boxes can add. The bridge can carry 5000 pounds, and the driver and the empty truck weigh 3755 pounds. So, the weight the boxes can add is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can fit in 1245 pounds, we divide 1245 by 15:
   \[
   1245 \div 15 = 83
   \]

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

The answer is: 83"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Stephen's groceries cost $40.00. The delivery person added a 25% fee to that, which is $40.00 times 25%, or $10.00. So now the total is $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00. Then, Stephen added a $3.00 delivery fee and a $4.00 tip. So, we add those to the $50.00:

$50.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $57.00."
"To find the total number of raspberries, we start by calculating the number of raspberries in the clusters. There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 raspberries. So, we multiply 6 by 20:

\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Now, we add the 67 individual raspberries to the 120 raspberries from the clusters:

\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \]

So, the total number of raspberries is 187.

The final answer is:
\[ 187 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have a basket with 25 oranges. Out of these, 1 is bad. 20% of the oranges are unripe, and 2 are sour. We need to find out how many oranges are good.

First, let's find out how many oranges are unripe. 20% of 25 oranges is:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{20}{100} \times 25 = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

So, we have 5 unripe oranges. Now, we know there's 1 bad orange and 2 sour oranges. Adding these up, we get:
\[ 1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, to find out how many oranges are good, we subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
\[ 25 - 8 = 17 \]

So, the number of good oranges is 17.

The correct answer is 17."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Janet spends $500 on the material to make the brooch.
2. She also spends $800 to have the jeweler make it.
3. So, the total cost before insurance is $500 + $800 = $1300.
4. She has to pay 10% of $1300 for insurance. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate 10/100 * $1300 = $130.
5. Now, we add the insurance cost to the total cost: $1300 + $130 = $1430.

So, Janet paid a total of $1430."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Marcy gets a pension of $50,000 each year for the first 20 years. So, for 20 years, she gets:
\[ 20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000 \text{ dollars} \]

After 20 years, she starts getting 5% of her total pension each year. Her total pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000. So, for the next 10 years, she gets:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 1,000,000 = 0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000 \text{ dollars per year} \]

So, for the next 10 years, she gets $50,000 each year. Adding the first 20 years and the next 10 years together, her total pension is:
\[ 50,000 + 50,000 = 100,000 \text{ dollars per year} \]

So, after 30 years, Marcy's annual pension is $100,000. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{100000} \]"
"To find out how much Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the cost for the first half of the year. There are 6 months in the first half, and the service costs $140 per month. So, we multiply $140 by 6:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the second half of the year. The service charges 10% less in the second half. So, we first find 10% of $140:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 140 = 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we subtract this amount from the original $140 to get the reduced cost for the second half:
\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost for the second half of the year by multiplying $126 by 6:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the costs of the first and second halves to find the total amount paid:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{1596} \]"
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to know how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas. She drove 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas, so we divide 100 by 4 to find out how many miles she gets per gallon:

\[ 100 \div 4 = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon. Her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, so we multiply 25 by 12 to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank:

\[ 25 \times 12 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas. The answer is 300 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jim watches TV for 2 hours.
2. He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 1 hour.
3. In one session, he spends 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours.
4. He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session × 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.
5. Over 4 weeks, he spends 9 hours/week × 4 weeks = 36 hours.

So, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Each school sends:
- 5 girls' players
- 5 boys' players
- 1 coach for the girls' team
- 1 coach for the boys' team

So, each school sends:
\[ 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12 \text{ people} \]

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

So, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The treasure hunter found 175 diamonds.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the diamonds. So, we subtract 35 from 175:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 rubies.
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we multiply 140 by 2:
   \[
   140 \times 2 = 280
   \]
   So, there are 280 emeralds.

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:
\[
175 + 140 + 280 = 605
\]

So, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 605. The correct answer is:

\boxed{605}"
"Okay, let's solve the problem again in a simpler way.

We know there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls. So, the number of boys is:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Now, the total number of students is the number of boys plus the number of girls:
\[ 60 + 120 = 180 \]

We are told that there are 5 students for every teacher. So, to find out how many teachers there are, we divide the total number of students by 5:
\[ \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

So, the number of teachers is 36.

The final answer is 36."
"Bailey starts with some money and then gets $5 each week for 8 weeks. At the end, she has $100. We need to find out how much money she had at the beginning.

First, let's see how much money she gets in total from her allowance:
- She gets $5 each week.
- She gets this allowance for 8 weeks.

So, the total allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, she has $100 in total. To find out how much she had at the beginning, we subtract the total allowance from the total amount she has:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{60} \]"
"To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to add up her earnings from weekdays and Saturday.

First, let's calculate her earnings from weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday, and there are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15.00 per student.

So, the number of students she teaches in one weekday is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 75 \text{ students/day} \]

The total number of students she teaches in 5 weekdays is:
\[ 75 \text{ students/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 375 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from the weekdays are:
\[ 375 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$5625.00 \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
- Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches on Saturday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 120 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from Saturday are:
\[ 120 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$1800.00 \]

Finally, her total earnings for the week are the sum of her earnings from the weekdays and Saturday:
\[ \$5625.00 + \$1800.00 = \$7425.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is:
\[ \boxed{7425} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Kelian has two recipes. The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 20 times 2, which is 40 instructions.

Now, to find out the total number of instructions, we add the instructions from both recipes together:
20 (from the first recipe) + 40 (from the second recipe) = 60 instructions.

So, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes. The answer is 60."
"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to add the money he gets from selling brownies and the money he gets from selling cheesecakes.

First, let's calculate the money from the brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie costs $3.

So, the money from brownies is:
\[ 43 \times 3 = 129 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the money from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake costs $4.

So, the money from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money from the brownies and the cheesecakes to find the total money Tommy raises:
\[ 129 + 92 = 221 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total money Tommy raises is:
\[ \boxed{221} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Shiela bought 5 cell phones, each costing $150. So, the total cost of the cell phones is:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, there's a 2% interest on each cell phone. To find out the total interest, we calculate:
\[ 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Shiela has to pay is:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \text{ dollars} \]

Shiela will pay this amount over 3 months. To find out how much she pays each month, we divide the total amount by 3:
\[ 765 \div 3 = 255 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Shiela will pay \(\boxed{255}\) dollars each month for 3 months."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Artie has three types of flowers:
- Marigolds for $2.74 each
- Petunias for $1.87 each
- Begonias for $2.12 each

He rounds these prices to the nearest dollar:
- Marigolds round to $3.00
- Petunias round to $2.00
- Begonias round to $2.00

Now, let's see how many pots of each he sells:
- 12 pots of marigolds
- 9 pots of petunias
- 17 pots of begonias

Next, we calculate the money he makes from each type of flower:
- From marigolds: \(12 \times 3 = 36\) dollars
- From petunias: \(9 \times 2 = 18\) dollars
- From begonias: \(17 \times 2 = 34\) dollars

Now, we add up all the money:

So, the total amount Artie will make is \(\boxed{88}\) dollars."
"To find the average square footage of each level in Luke's sandcastle, let's first list the square footage of each level:

- The top level (Level 4) has 16 square feet.
- The level below it (Level 3) has half of 16, which is 8 square feet.
- The level below that (Level 2) has half of 8, which is 4 square feet.
- The bottom level (Level 1) has half of 4, which is 2 square feet.

Now, we add up the square footage of all the levels:
16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square feet

There are 4 levels, so to find the average, we divide the total square footage by the number of levels:
30 ÷ 4 = 7.5 square feet

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet.

The correct answer is:
\boxed{7.5}"
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will give to the puppy in the first 180 days and the remaining days of the year.

First, let's calculate the dog food for the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food each day for 180 days.
- So, the total for the first 180 days is \(1 \times 180 = 180\) cups.

Next, let's find out how many days are left in the year after the first 180 days:
- A year has 365 days.
- So, the remaining days are \(365 - 180 = 185\) days.

Now, let's calculate the dog food for the remaining 185 days:
- The puppy eats 2 cups of dog food each day for 185 days.
- So, the total for the remaining 185 days is \(2 \times 185 = 370\) cups.

Now, let's add the dog food for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days:
- Total dog food for the first year is \(180 + 370 = 550\) cups.

Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia will use, we divide the total cups by the cups per bag:
- Number of bags needed is \(550 \div 110 = 5\).

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year. The answer is 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. David does half of what Sarah does, so we divide 400 by 4:
   \[
   400 \div 4 = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half of what Sarah does, so we divide 400 by 2:
   \[
   400 \div 2 = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. Now, to find out how much more Raymond does than David, we subtract David's laundry from Raymond's:
   \[
   200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, Raymond does 100 pounds more laundry than David. The answer is 100 pounds."
"To find out how much money Vincent saves, let's first see how many packages of 3 flowers he needs and how many packages of 2 flowers he needs to buy 18 flowers.

For packages of 3 flowers:
- Each package costs $2.50.
- To get 18 flowers, he needs 18 / 3 = 6 packages.
- So, the total cost is 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.

For packages of 2 flowers:
- Each package costs $1.
- To get 18 flowers, he needs 18 / 2 = 9 packages.
- So, the total cost is 9 * $1 = $9.00.

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost of packages of 3 flowers: $15.00
- Cost of packages of 2 flowers: $9.00

Vincent saves more money by buying the flowers in packages of 2. So, the amount saved is $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00.

The amount of money Vincent saves is $6.00."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for a better understanding.

John wants to take his new dog to the groomer. The regular cost is $100. The groomer gives a 30% discount to new customers. 

First, we need to find out how much 30% of $100 is. We do this by calculating 30% of $100:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{30}{100} \times 100 = 30 \]

So, the discount is $30. Now, we subtract this discount from the original cost:

\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the cost after the discount is $70.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We start with 24 liters of water.
2. Two girls each get 1/6 of the 24 liters. So, each girl gets:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]
   Since there are two girls, they together get:
   \[
   4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Then a boy gets 6 liters of water.
4. Now, we add the water the girls and the boy got:
   \[
   8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
   \]
5. We subtract the total water they got from the original amount of water:
   \[
   24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the amount of water left is 10 liters. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's count the stickers step by step:

1. Charlie starts with 10 stickers.
2. He buys 21 more stickers, so he now has \(10 + 21 = 31\) stickers.
3. For his birthday, he gets 23 more stickers, so he now has \(31 + 23 = 54\) stickers.
4. Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister, so he now has \(54 - 9 = 45\) stickers.
5. He uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so he now has \(45 - 28 = 17\) stickers left.

So, the number of stickers Charlie has left is 17. The answer is 17."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Alex's weight first. Grace weighs 125 pounds. To find out how much Alex weighs, we do this:

1. First, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight: \(4 \times 125 = 500\) pounds.
2. Then, we subtract 2 pounds from 500 pounds to get Alex's weight: \(500 - 2 = 498\) pounds.
3. Now, to find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together: \(125 + 498 = 623\) pounds.

So, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds. The correct answer is:

Dan has 3 rose bushes. Each bush has 25 roses. So, the total number of roses is:
3 bushes × 25 roses/bush = 75 roses

Each rose has 8 thorns. So, the total number of thorns is:
75 roses × 8 thorns/rose = 600 thorns

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the team played 22 games. Let's say they lost \( L \) games. According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so they won \( L + 8 \) games.

The total number of games they played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, they won:
\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games. The correct answer is 15."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Gene goes on 4 vacations each year. He started vacationing when he was 23 years old and now he is 34 years old. To find out how many vacations he has been on, we subtract his starting age from his current age and then divide by the number of vacations he takes each year.

So, \(34 - 23 = 11\). This means Gene has been on 11 vacations. Since each vacation is one quilt block, he has 11 quilt blocks in total.

The total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Greg's alarm rings three times a day. Here's what happened:

1. The first time it rang, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it rang, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it rang, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, to find out how many times the alarm rang in all, we add up all the times it rang:

\[4 + 12 + 6 = 22\]

So, the alarm rang a total of 22 times. The answer is 22."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sylvie gets $600 a month at her job. The company gives her a raise every year if she's been there for 5 years. The raise is 10% of what she gets now.

1. First, we find out how much 10% of $600 is. It's $60.
2. So, after the first year, her salary becomes $600 + $60 = $660.
3. In the second year, she gets another 10% raise on $660. That's $660 * 0.10 = $66.
4. So, after the second year, her salary becomes $660 + $66 = $726.
5. In the third year, she gets another 10% raise on $726. That's $726 * 0.10 = $72.60.
6. So, after the third year, her salary becomes $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.

So, after three more years of working, Sylvie's salary will be $798.60 a month. 

If we need to pick from the given options, let's say the options are:
A) $660
B) $726
C) $798.60

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. So if Harald sold \( H \) copies, Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records is 88,000. So we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The answer is:

\[ 8000 \]"
"Christina invited 16 friends, and 1/4 of them don't come. So, 3/4 of 16 will come to the party. 

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \]

Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest. So, for 12 guests, she needs:

\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Christina will spend $18 on gift bags. 

The answer is: **18**"
"To find out how much potato salad Ted needs, we need to add up what the adults and children will eat.

First, let's figure out how much the adults will eat. Each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad, and there are 20 adults. So we do:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ pounds/adult} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, let's find out how much the children will eat. Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds} \div 2 = 5 \text{ pounds} \]
There are 5 children, so the children will eat:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ pounds/child} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the potato salad the adults and children will eat:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} + 25 \text{ pounds} = 225 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The correct answer is 225 pounds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, to find out how many pets they all have together, we add up the pets:

\[4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28 \text{ pets}\]

So, the total number of pets the three have is 28.

3. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, so Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.
4. Amy is also 5 years older than Jackson, so Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old. The answer is: 4"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
2. Lee used to be able to run it 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so Gerald used to run it in 40 seconds.
3. Now, Gerald's speed has improved by 10%. That means he can run 10% faster than before.
4. To find out how much faster, we calculate 10% of 40 seconds: \(40 \times 0.10 = 4\) seconds.
5. So, Gerald can now run it in \(40 - 4 = 36\) seconds.

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.

The answer is: 36 seconds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood. For every dog, there are 2 cats, so there are 2 times 60 cats, which is 120 cats.

Now, we need to find out how many rabbits there are. The problem says the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats. So, we first add the number of dogs and cats together:
\[ 60 \text{ (dogs)} + 120 \text{ (cats)} = 180 \]

Then, we subtract 12 from this total to find the number of rabbits:
\[ 180 - 12 = 168 \text{ (rabbits)} \]

Now, to find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together:
\[ 60 \text{ (dogs)} + 120 \text{ (cats)} + 168 \text{ (rabbits)} = 348 \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348. 

The correct answer is 348."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have 200 students in total. Out of these, 2/5 are boys. So, we calculate the number of boys:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]
So, there are 80 boys.

This means the rest are girls:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]
So, there are 120 girls.

Now, 2/3 of these girls are in the girl scout:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]
So, 80 girls are in the girl scout.

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40. The answer is 40."
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we start by noting that Harry slept 9 hours. James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. So, we calculate how many hours James slept:

\[
\text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The answer is 3 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Freda made 32 ounces of tomato sauce. When she cooks the tomatoes, they lose half their volume. So, before cooking, the tomatoes must have been twice that amount. That means they were 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces of tomatoes.

Each can of tomatoes she uses is 16 ounces. To find out how many cans she used, we divide the total tomatoes by the size of one can: 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

Each can has 3 tomatoes. So, if she used 4 cans, the total number of tomatoes is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

So, the number of tomatoes Freda used is 12. The answer is 12."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through. Let's call this number \( x \).
3. In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through.
4. 5 cars take an exit.
5. The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).
6. The number of cars left on the motorway after the traffic jam is 5.

So, we can write the equation for the cars left on the motorway as:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = 5 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = 5 \]
\[ 30 - x - 25 = 5 \]
\[ 5 - x = 5 \]

Now, solving for \( x \):
\[ -x = 5 - 5 \]
\[ -x = 0 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The answer is: **5**"
"Mary had 2 potted plants on each of her 40 window ledges. So, she had:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Then, she got 18 more plants from the nursery, so she had:
\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 plant from each of the 40 ledges to friends and family. So, she will give away:
\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \text{ plants} \]

To find out how many plants she will have left, we subtract the plants she gave away from the total plants she had:
\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, Mary will have 58 potted plants left. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Jerome had 4 friends come to visit him. Here's how many times each friend pressed the doorbell:

- The first friend pressed it 20 times.
- The second friend pressed it 1/4 more times than the first friend. So, 1/4 of 20 is 5, and adding that to 20 gives us 25 times.
- The fourth friend pressed it 60 times.
- The third friend pressed it 10 more times than the fourth friend, so that's 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, let's add all these up:
- First friend: 20 times
- Second friend: 25 times
- Fourth friend: 60 times
- Third friend: 70 times

So, we add them all together: 20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is 175."

On weekends, he drinks only 1 glass of water with dinner:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, let's add the glasses from weekdays and weekends:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

So, John drinks 22 glasses of water in a week. The answer is 22."
"To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile. We do this by dividing 10 minutes by 3 miles:

\[ \text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = 3.33 \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Now, the city is 42 miles across. To find out the total time to cover the whole city, we multiply the time it takes to cover 1 mile by 42 miles:

\[ \text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times 3.33 \text{ minutes per mile} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city. The answer is:

The answer is 20."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a simpler understanding.

John has 3 boxes, and each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. But the walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to find out how much space is inside each box.

1. **Find the inner size of one box:**
   - The outer length is 5 inches, but the walls are 1 inch thick on each side, so the inner length is \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches.
   - The outer width is 6 inches, so the inner width is \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches.
   - The outer height is 4 inches, so the inner height is \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches.

2. **Calculate the inner volume of one box:**
   - The volume of a box is length times width times height.
   - So, the inner volume of one box is \(3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24\) cubic inches.

3. **Calculate the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3.
   - So, the total inner volume is \(24 \times 3 = 72\) cubic inches.

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\) cubic inches."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Frankie watched TV for different amounts of time each day. We know he watched:
- 1 hour on Monday
- 1 hour on Tuesday
- 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours) on Wednesday
- 1 hour and 30 minutes (which is 1.5 hours) on Thursday
- 2 hours on Friday

Now, let's add up all the hours he watched:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the extra time he watched must be:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

The extra hour he watched was a 1-hour episode. He didn't watch any 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

So, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Henry wanted to bake twice as many cookies as last year. Let's say last year he baked \( x \) cookies.
2. So, this year he wanted to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. But he ended up baking 15 more than he wanted, so he baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. After baking, he dropped 5 cookies, so he had \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies left.
5. We know he ended up with 110 cookies, so \( 2x + 10 = 110 \).
6. To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
   Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 100
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year. The answer is 50."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way:

1. First, we need to find out how much 10 gallons of gas cost without any cashback. If one gallon costs $3.00, then 10 gallons will cost:
   \[
   10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Next, we need to calculate the cashback. The cashback is $0.20 for each gallon. So for 10 gallons, the cashback will be:
   \[
   10 \times 0.20 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Now, we subtract the cashback from the total cost of the gas:
   \[
   30 - 2 = 28 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, after getting the cashback, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas is $28.00.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{28.00}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a simpler understanding.

Beatrice's fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, the total number of roll-ups she ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Marcell's fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, the total number of roll-ups he ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups they both ate:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find out how many roll-ups they ate on average, we divide the total by 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, the average number of roll-ups they ate is 45. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. We need to find out how much water the boat takes on for every 10 feet she rows. For every 20 feet, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. So, for every 10 feet, it takes on 1 liter of water.

Now, we know the shore is 64 seconds away. We need to find out how many 10-foot segments are in 64 seconds. Since it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, in 64 seconds she rows:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

For 80 feet, the boat takes on:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}} \times 1 \text{ liter} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat took on 8 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore. 

The correct answer is: **8 liters**"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We have 4 teachers.
2. Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
3. So, the total number of lessons in a day is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) lessons.
4. Each lesson, the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times.
5. To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson: \(8 \times 3 = 24\).

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

The final answer is 24."
"Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. After 15 days, he plants:

\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the number of flowers Ryan has is 25."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. The problem says Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, if we divide 1800 by 6, we get how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold.

\[ 1800 \div 6 = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Now, the problem also says that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. This means if we take 300 and divide it by 50, we get the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

\[ 300 \div 50 = 6 \]

So, Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo shows 6 ducks.

The number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Sasha has some leftover lumber she wants to sell. She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each, and 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $16 each.

First, let's find out how much she spent on the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards, and each costs $10.
- So, \(10 \times 10 = 100\) dollars.

Next, let's find out how much she spent on the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards, and each costs $16.
- So, \(5 \times 16 = 80\) dollars.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
- Total cost = $100 + $80 = $180.

If she sells all the leftover lumber, she will get $180 from selling it.

Since she spent $180 to get the lumber and she gets $180 from selling it, her profit is:
- Profit = $180 - $180 = $0.

So, Sasha makes a profit of $0. The answer is \boxed{0}."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Katy uses sugar and water in a 7:13 ratio. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Together, that makes 7 + 13 = 20 parts in total.

We know that the total parts used are 120. So, each part is equal to 120 ÷ 20 = 6 teaspoons.

Since the sugar part is 7, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is 7 × 6 = 42 teaspoons.

So, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is 42.

The final answer is 42."

The total amount John paid is $360."
"To find out how many containers were imported on the second day, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know that on the first day, 2 containers were imported, and each container had 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles imported on the first day was:
   \[
   2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

2. After the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. So, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:
   \[
   30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

3. Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers}
   \]

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. Adrien's initial salary was $40,000.
2. Lylah's initial salary was calculated by dividing Adrien's initial salary by 1.3 because Adrien's salary was 30% more than Lylah's. So, Lylah's salary was about $30,769.
3. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. So, his new salary is $40,000 + 40% of $40,000 = $40,000 + $16,000 = $56,000.
4. Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, her new salary is $30,769 + 40% of $30,769 = $30,769 + $12,308 = $43,077.
5. To find the total salary they were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's new salary and Lylah's new salary: $56,000 + $43,077 = $99,077.

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $99,077. The closest option to this is $99,076.92.

The final answer is: **$99,076.92**"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can do the following:

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, in one week, he uses:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

If we assume a month has about 4 weeks, then in one month he uses:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

So, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is 240. The answer is 240."

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, let's count it day by day.

- On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
- On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
- On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
- On Thursday and Friday, she slept 1 hour more than the total she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. The total for Tuesday and Wednesday is \(6 + 4 = 10\) hours. So, on Thursday and Friday, she slept \(10 + 1 = 11\) hours each day.

Now, let's add up all the hours:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 4 hours
- Thursday: 11 hours

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, in 3 hours, she runs:
   \[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

2. After 3 hours, she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. She has 7 hours in total, so the remaining time is:
   \[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

3. In those 4 hours, she runs:
   \[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

4. Now, to find the total distance she runs in 7 hours, we add the distances from both parts:

2. Her husband bought 5 more spoons and gave them to Julia.
3. Julia used 3 spoons to taste her stew.
4. After all this, Julia had 12 spoons left.

So, we can write the equation to represent this:
\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Now, let's solve the equation:
\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

To find \( x \), we need to subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Julia originally bought 10 spoons.

The number of spoons in the package Julia bought is \(\boxed{10}\)."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. Each pepper costs $15.
2. A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, so:
   \[
   3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so:
   \[
   45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total patient hours per day:**
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, which is 0.4 hours.
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - So, the total patient hours per day is \(500 \times 0.4 = 200\) hours.

2. **Revenue from patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients.
   - So, the total revenue from patients is \(200 \times 200 = 40,000\) dollars.

3. **Cost to the hospital:**
   - The doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
   - So, the total cost to the hospital is \(200 \times 150 = 30,000\) dollars.

4. **Profit:**
   - Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - So, the profit is \(40,000 - 30,000 = 10,000\) dollars.

The hospital makes a profit of **10,000 dollars** from these visits."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Nissa hires 60 elves.
2. A third of them quit because the kids vomit on them. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 elves quit.
3. Now, we subtract the 20 elves who quit from the original 60:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 elves are left.
4. Then, 10 more elves quit because the kids kicked them. We subtract these 10 from the 40 elves left:

"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can do it step by step.

First, we need to know how many car washes Tom gets in a year. Since he gets 4 car washes each month and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 4 by 12:

\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Next, we know each car wash costs $15. So, to find out the total cost for 48 car washes, we multiply 48 by 15:

\[ 48 \text{ car washes} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

The correct answer is **720 dollars**."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

First, Rory orders 2 subs for $7.50 each. So, the cost for the subs is:
\[ 2 \times 7.50 = 15 \]

Next, she buys 2 bags of chips for $1.50 each. So, the cost for the chips is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3 \]

Then, she buys 2 cookies for $1.00 each. So, the cost for the cookies is:
\[ 2 \times 1.00 = 2 \]

Now, let's add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
\[ 15 + 3 + 2 = 20 \]

There's a 20% delivery fee added. So, we calculate 20% of $20:
\[ 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \]

Adding the delivery fee to the subtotal:
\[ 20 + 4 = 24 \]

Finally, she wants to add a $5.00 tip. So, we add the tip to the total:

\[ \text{Pink gumballs} = 4 \times \text{Blue gumballs} + 22 \]

Since there are 12 blue gumballs, we substitute 12 for blue gumballs:

\[ \text{Pink gumballs} = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]

Now, let's do the math:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]
\[ 48 + 22 = 70 \]

So, there are 70 pink gumballs.

The number of pink gumballs is \boxed{70}."

We know there are 700 bees in total. The problem tells us there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens. Let's use a simple way to find out how many there are of each type of bee.

1. Let's say there are \( Q \) queens.
2. Since there are twice as many baby bees as queens, there are \( 2Q \) baby bees.
3. And since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, there are \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \) worker bees.

Now, we know the total number of bees is the sum of queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

So, there are 100 queens. Now we can find out how many baby bees and worker bees there are:
- Baby bees = \( 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \)
- Worker bees = \( 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \)

Therefore, the number of worker bees is 400.

The final answer is 400."
"To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many hours Jordan plays video games in a week. He plays for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week. So, we multiply 2 hours by 7 days:
   \[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ hours} \]

2. Now, we know he earns $10 for each hour he works. So, to find out how much he earns in a week, we multiply the number of hours he works by his hourly wage:
   \[ 14 \times 10 = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jordan would earn 140 dollars in one week if he spent his video game time working instead. The answer is 140."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John buys different things and we need to find out the total cost including tax. Here's what he buys:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

First, we add up the cost of the non-food items (light bulbs and roach traps) because they have a tax:
- Cost of light bulbs: $3
- Cost of roach traps: $4
- Tax on light bulbs: $3 * 10% = $0.30
- Tax on roach traps: $4 * 10% = $0.40

Now, we add the tax to the cost of the light bulbs and roach traps:
- Total cost of light bulbs including tax: $3 + $0.30 = $3.30
- Total cost of roach traps including tax: $4 + $0.40 = $4.40

Next, we add the cost of the food items (milk, eggs, and cups):
- Cost of milk: $2
- Cost of eggs: $3
- Cost of cups: $3

Now, we add all these together:
- Total cost of milk: $2
- Total cost of eggs: $3
- Total cost of cups: $3
- Total cost of light bulbs including tax: $3.30
- Total cost of roach traps including tax: $4.40

Adding these up:
$2 + $3 + $3 + $3.30 + $4.40 = $15.70

So, the total cost including tax is $15.70."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Kim has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so he will have 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.

First, let's find out how much bleach and cloths cost for all clients:
- Each bottle of bleach costs $2, and each client needs 2 bottles, so for 8 clients, it's \(8 \times 2 = 16\) bottles. So, the cost for bleach is \(16 \times 2 = \$32\).
- Each pack of cloths costs $5, and each client needs 1 pack, so for 8 clients, it's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) packs. So, the cost for cloths is \(8 \times 5 = \$40\).

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the clients:
- Total cost for bleach and cloths is \(32 + 40 = \$72\).

Kim's total income each week is $92. To find out the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total income:
- Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20.

So, the profit Kim will make each week is $20. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field. In each hectare, there are 100 pineapples. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. To find out how many pineapples he can harvest in a year, we need to calculate it step by step.

First, let's find out how many times John can harvest his pineapples in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year and he harvests every 3 months, we can calculate:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Next, we know that in each hectare, he gets 100 pineapples every 3 months. So, in a year, he gets:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is 4000."
"Johnny has three lego sets. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, so it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has a quarter of the number of pieces as the first set, so it has \(500 \div 4 = 125\) pieces.

To find out how many pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:
\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up 2125 pieces of legos. The answer is 2125."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then she saw half that many bees return in the next 6 hours. So, the number of bees that returned is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ bees} \]

In the next 6 hours, she saw twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours. So, the number of bees that left is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees} \]

Now, at the end of the first 12 hours, the hive had:

\[ 0 - 30 + 15 = -15 \text{ bees} \]

This means there were 15 bees that left but didn't return yet. In the last 6 hours, all these 15 bees that left returned to the hive. So, the number of bees that returned in the last 6 hours is:

\[ 15 \text{ bees} \]

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to add the cost of one adult ticket and one child ticket together. The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. So, we add these amounts:

\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

This means the total cost for one adult and one child ticket is $22. Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, we add this to the total cost to find out how much she gave the cashier:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, and Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. So, to find out how many friends Dorothy has, we divide Charlie's friends by 3:

\[ 12 \div 3 = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 friends.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

The final answer is 16."
"Steve lives 3 miles away from school and he can bike at 440 feet per minute. First, we need to convert 3 miles into feet. Since 1 mile is 5280 feet, 3 miles is 3 times 5280 feet, which equals 15840 feet.

Now, to find out how long it takes Steve to bike 15840 feet at 440 feet per minute, we divide the total distance by his speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Tim lives 2 miles away from school, which is 10560 feet. Tim can skate at 264 feet per minute, so the time it takes him to skate 10560 feet is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Steve takes 36 minutes to get home, and Tim takes 40 minutes. The difference in their times is:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The answer is: 4 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Shawnda charges 25 cents to inflate each tire. She had different people come with different types of bikes and tricycles.

First, 5 people came with bicycles. Each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 bicycles × 2 tires/bicycle = 10 tires. At 25 cents per tire, that's 10 tires × 25 cents/tire = 250 cents.

Next, 3 people came with tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 tricycles × 3 tires/tricycle = 9 tires. At 25 cents per tire, that's 9 tires × 25 cents/tire = 225 cents.

Finally, 1 person came with a unicycle. A unicycle has 1 tire, so that's 1 tire × 25 cents/tire = 25 cents.

Now, we add all these up: 250 cents + 225 cents + 25 cents = 500 cents.

To change 500 cents to dollars, we know that 100 cents make 1 dollar. So, 500 cents ÷ 100 = 5 dollars.

Therefore, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, he gets:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies per pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for all the cookies is:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times $0.10 \text{ per cookie} = $6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he gets, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill:
\[ $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00 \]

So, the change Carl receives is:
\[ \boxed{4.00} \]"
"Let's work through this step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate \(14 \div 2 = 7\) fries.
3. After the seagull, the number of fries left is \(14 + 7 = 21\).
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries in total.
5. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \(21 - 9 = 12\).
6. A raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \) fries.
7. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \(12 - 8 = 4\).
8. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, the number of fries left before the ants was \(4 + 1 = 5\).

From the steps above, we can see that the initial number of fries in the pack was 21 (after Dave ate 14 and the seagull ate 7).

So, the number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it was \(\boxed{21}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Kimo has classes on different days of the week. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. So, on these days, he spends 3 hours each day. Since there are 3 such days in a week, he spends \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours in a week on these days. Over 16 weeks, he spends \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, on these days, he spends 4 hours each day. Since there are 2 such days in a week, he spends \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours in a week on these days. Over 16 weeks, he spends \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Now, to find out the total hours he spends in a semester, we add the hours from both types of days:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

So, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester. The answer is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"To find out how long all the baked goods are when put end to end, we need to add up the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes.

First, let's add up the lengths of the rolls:
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Bill bakes 300 rolls.
- So, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

Next, let's add up the lengths of the croissants:
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Bill bakes 120 croissants.
- So, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

Then, let's add up the lengths of the baguettes:
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.
- There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
- So, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, let's add up all these lengths:
- Total length = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes
- Total length = \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

To convert inches to feet, we know that 12 inches make 1 foot. So, we divide the total length in inches by 12:
- Total length in feet = \(3360 \div 12 = 280\) feet.

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{280}

"To find out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to add up the bananas needed by all the apes for 2 months.

First, let's look at the monkeys:
- Monkeys need 200 bananas every month.
- For 2 months, the monkeys need \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

Next, let's look at the gorillas:
- Gorillas need 400 bananas every month.
- For 2 months, the gorillas need \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

Now, let's look at the baboons:
- Baboons need 100 bananas every month.
- For 2 months, the baboons need \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, we add up all the bananas needed:
- Monkeys: 400 bananas
- Gorillas: 800 bananas
- Baboons: 200 bananas

So, the total number of bananas needed is \(400 + 800 + 200 = 1400\) bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a simpler understanding.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each time he runs 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). So, if he does this 15 times, he runs:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back. That's 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times, so she runs:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly, we subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner runs 280 yards farther than the loser. The answer is:

So, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is 15.

The final answer is 15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a better understanding.

On Monday, the tank has 17 feet of water.

On Tuesday, it has 7 feet more than Monday, so:
\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

On Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So we need to find two-thirds of 24 feet:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The final answer is:

"Let's break it down step by step:

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:

- Starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together:
\[ 15 + 9 + 8 = 32 \]

So, the total number of fish they caught is 32. The correct answer is 32."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. The original price of a bag of marbles is $20.
2. The price goes up by 20% every two months. So, 20% of $20 is $4.
3. We need to know how many two-month periods are in 36 months. That's 36 divided by 2, which is 18.
4. So, the price goes up by $4, 18 times. That's $4 times 18, which is $72.
5. To find the new price, we add the total increase to the original price: $20 + $72 = $92.

So, the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $92. The correct answer is **$92**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know one red car costs $4.
2. One red car is the same as 3 action figures. So, one action figure costs $4 ÷ 3 = $1.33 (but we are told it costs $5).
3. We have 5 red cars, so the cost of the red cars is 5 × $4 = $20.
4. We have 3 action figures, and each costs $5, so the cost of the action figures is 3 × $5 = $15.
5. The doll costs the same as 3 action figures, so it costs $15.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
- Red cars: $20
- Action figures: $15
- Doll: $15

So, the total cost is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

The total value of all the toys is $50."

"Elvira has a budget of €1500 for her birthday gift. She buys a computer with accessories that cost €157 for the screen, €74 for the keyboard and mouse, €102 for the scanner, €74 for the CD burner, and €102 for the printer. Let's add up all these costs to see how much she spends on the accessories.

First, add the costs of the accessories:
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

€157 + €74 = €231
€231 + €102 = €333
€333 + €74 = €407
€407 + €102 = €509

So, Elvira spends €509 on the accessories. Now, to find out how much money she has left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

€1500 - €509 = €991

Elvira will have €991 left for her clothing. So, the answer is €991."

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is \( B \) years old, Seth is \( 2B \) years old.

In two years, Brooke will be \( B + 2 \) years old and Seth will be \( 2B + 2 \) years old. The problem says that in two years, their ages will add up to 28. So we can write the equation:

\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Now let's solve this equation:

\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

So Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So Seth is 16 years old. The answer is 16."

"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to add up the miles he walks on weekdays and the miles he walks on weekends.

First, let's calculate the miles he walks on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, and he walks 20 miles each day on weekdays.
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 20 \text{ miles/day} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the miles he walks on weekends. There are 2 days in the weekend, and he walks 10 miles each day on weekends.
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ miles/day} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from weekdays and weekends together to find the total miles he walks in a week.
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week. The correct answer is 120 miles."
"To find out how much each uniform costs, we need to add up the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants.

First, we know the hat costs $25.

Next, the jacket costs three times as much as the hat. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]
So, the jacket costs $75.

Now, the pants cost the average of the hat and jacket costs. To find the average, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket and then divide by 2:
\[ \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]
So, the pants cost $50.

To find the total cost of the uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150.

The final answer is:

"Jake sees different types of creatures in the museum. Let's count the legs for each type:

- Spiders: There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, the total number of legs from the spiders is \(80 \times 8 = 640\) legs.
- Insects: There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. So, the total number of legs from the insects is \(90 \times 6 = 540\) legs.
- Rare mutant invertebrates: There are 3 of these, and each has 10 legs. So, the total number of legs from the rare mutant invertebrates is \(3 \times 10 = 30\) legs.

Now, let's add up all the legs:
\[640 + 540 + 30 = 1210\]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{1210} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.
5. The Caboose is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so the Caboose is 8 years old.

Now, to find the total age of all four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Caboose: 8 years

Adding these together:

"Jessica has three debts:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

First, we add these up to find the total minimum monthly payment:

"Billy has 60 potatoes to peel and cut. It takes him 1.5 minutes to peel one potato and 5 seconds to cut one potato.

First, let's find out how long it takes to peel and cut one potato:
- Peeling one potato takes 1.5 minutes, which is the same as 90 seconds.
- Cutting one potato takes 5 seconds.

So, the total time to peel and cut one potato is:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it will take to do this for 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert 5700 seconds into minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{95 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Juan and Carlos sell lemonade and make $25 in profit. They sell each gallon for $10 (20 glasses at $0.50 each). They spend $5 on lemons and sugar for each gallon they make.

If they made $25 in profit, we can figure out how much they spent on lemons by first finding out how much they spent in total. Since their profit is $25, and they spent $5 on lemons and sugar for each gallon, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \text{Profit} \]

\[ \text{Total Revenue} - (\text{Cost of Lemons} + \text{Cost of Sugar}) = \$25 \]

\[ \text{Total Revenue} - \$5x = \$25 \]

We know the total revenue is $10x (since they sell 20 glasses at $0.50 each per gallon), and they made $25 profit. So:

\[ 10x - 5x = 25 \]

\[ 5x = 25 \]

\[ x = 5 \]

So, they sold 5 gallons. Now, to find out how much they spent on lemons, we multiply the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon by the number of gallons:

\[ \$5 \times 5 = \$25 \]

But we need to find out how much they spent on lemons only. Since they spend $3 on lemons per gallon, we multiply:

\[ \$3 \times 5 = \$15 \]

So, the amount they spent on lemons is $15. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 240 people in total, and 80 of them are Japanese.
2. So, the rest must be Chinese. To find out how many Chinese there are, we subtract the number of Japanese from the total:
   \[
   240 - 80 = 160
   \]
   So, there are 160 Chinese people in the race.
3. We are told that 60 of these Chinese people are boys.
4. To find out how many are girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:
   \[
   160 - 60 = 100
   \]

So, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100. The correct answer is 100."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

Zaid earns $6000 a month. He spends:
- 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $6000 / 4 = $1500.
- 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is $6000 / 3 = $2000.

So, after paying for rent and car fuel, he has:
- $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500 left.

Then, he donates half of the remaining amount to charity:
- Half of $2500 is $2500 / 2 = $1250.
- So, after the donation, he has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.

Next, he gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700:
- $1250 - $200 - $700 = $350.

So, the amount of money Zaid will have left after all these expenses and donations is $350.

The final answer is: **$350**"
"Let's break it down step by step:

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs} \]

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs} \]

Now, let's add up all the crabs:
\[ 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \text{ crabs} \]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours and earns $10 per hour, so:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours and earns $10 per hour, so:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks. The correct answer is \$130."
"To find out how many votes the loser got, we first need to know how many votes the winner got. The winner got 3/4 of the total votes, and the total number of votes is 80.

So, we calculate the winner's votes:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

This means the winner got 60 votes. Since there are 80 votes in total, the loser must have gotten the rest of the votes. So, we subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:
\[ 80 - 60 = 20 \]

Therefore, the loser got 20 votes. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sandra ordered white carnations, and we found out she ordered 40 of them. Now, she needs four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, we multiply the number of white carnations by 4:

\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

So, Sandra needs 160 red roses to be delivered by 5 pm. The answer is 160."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step again, but in a simpler way.

1. Jan's current age is 30.
2. Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
3. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age, so Mark was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years old two years ago.
4. So, Mark's current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).
5. Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean's age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

Therefore, Jean is 23 years old. The answer is 23."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have two teams running a relay race where each team has four members, and each member runs 400 meters.

### Team 1 (Very Well-Rounded Team)
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. So, for four members:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

### Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team)
The first runner takes 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Now, let's add up the times for Team 2:
\[ 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

### Difference in Time
To find out how many seconds Team 1 wins by, we subtract the total time of Team 1 from Team 2:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Team 1 wins by 2 seconds. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. We need to find out how much more likely it is for him to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

First, let's look at the numbers greater than 3. They are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 numbers out of 6 that are greater than 3. That means the chance of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, let's look at rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6. The chance of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The chance of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the chance of both happening is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. The difference in chances is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To find out how much more likely it is, we divide this difference by the chance of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} = 1 \]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many as her mom, so she picked 20 divided by 2, which is 10 apples. Together, they picked 20 plus 10, which is 30 apples. So, the total number of apples they picked is 30. The answer is 30."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Russell has given out 160 pieces of straw to the small rodents. Out of this, 50 pieces were given to the hamsters and 20 pieces were given to the rabbits. So, we need to find out how many pieces were given to the rats.

First, we subtract the pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total pieces:
\[ 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

These 90 pieces were given to the rats. Since there are 3 cages of rats and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can find out how many rats there are by dividing the total pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat gets:
\[ \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Now, since there are 3 cages of rats, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages to find out how many rats are in each cage:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how much Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest first. The interest is 2% per month, and Mandy owes $100.

1. Calculate the interest for one month:
   - 2% of $100 is $2.

2. Since the interest is for 3 months, we multiply the monthly interest by 3:
   - $2 per month * 3 months = $6.

3. Now, add the interest to the original amount Mandy owes:
   - $100 + $6 = $106.

So, Mandy should give Benedict **$106**.

The correct answer is **$106**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The trader buys wheat at $20 per bag and spends $2 to transport each bag. So, the total cost for one bag is $20 + $2 = $22. The trader sells each bag for $30 and made a total profit of $400.

To find out how many bags the trader sold, we can use the profit formula:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} \]

We know the profit is $400, and the selling price per bag is $30. So, the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is \( 30n \). The total cost for \( n \) bags is \( 22n \). Therefore:
\[ 400 = 30n - 22n \]
\[ 400 = 8n \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we have three friends who spent $20.25 on tickets to the fair. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. So, the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Now, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

They also went on 2 different rides, each costing $33. So, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the tickets and food to the total cost of the rides to find the overall total cost:
\[ 36.00 + 66 = 102.00 \]

Since they agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the overall total cost by 3:
\[ \frac{102.00}{3} = 34.00 \]

So, each of them paid $34.00.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. If he collects 2 peaches every minute, we need to find out how many peaches he collects in 180 minutes (since 3 hours is 180 minutes).

He collects 2 peaches per minute, so in 180 minutes, he collects:
\[ 2 \text{ peaches/minute} \times 180 \text{ minutes} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the number of peaches John collects is 360. The correct answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we first need to know how much each duck eats in a day. If 3.5 pounds is the total for a week, we divide that by 7 days to find out how much one duck eats in a day.

\[ \text{Daily amount for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we have 10 ducks, so we multiply the daily amount for one duck by 10:

\[ \text{Daily amount for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the ducks need 5 pounds of insects per day. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. Every year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
3. After 10 years, the number of trees he will have is \(50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
4. After 10 years, 30% of these trees die. So, \(30\%\) of 130 trees die, which is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.
5. Therefore, the number of trees left after the deaths is \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

So, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. On Friday morning, Sue has 18 pink plastic flamingos in her front yard.
2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors take back one third of the flamingos and paint them white. One third of 18 is 6, so 6 flamingos are taken back and painted white.
3. After taking back 6 flamingos, Sue has \(18 - 6 = 12\) pink flamingos left.
4. On Sunday morning, the neighbors add another 18 pink flamingos to the yard. So, Sue now has \(12 + 18 = 30\) pink flamingos.
5. The neighbors also painted 6 of the original pink flamingos white, so there are 6 white flamingos.
6. To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: \(30 - 6 = 24\).

So, there are 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos. The answer is 24."
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to know how much the crayons cost and how much money she has.

Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. So, the total cost for 5 crayons is:
\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Violetta has $20. To find out the change, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the money she has:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the change Violetta will get is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. So, if we add these two costs together, we get:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means a pen costs $1.50. Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We do this by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, 8 pens will cost $12.00. 

The final answer is: **$12.00**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

We have 200 pounds of carrots to give to 40 restaurants. Each restaurant gets 2 pounds of carrots.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of carrots all the restaurants will get together. We do this by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount each gets:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know we started with 200 pounds and gave out 80 pounds. To find out how many pounds are left, we subtract the amount given out from the total:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds.

The correct answer is: **120 pounds**"
"To find out how many kids there are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

So, the number of kids = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
Number of kids = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of kids = 23786 - 17509
Number of kids = 6277

So, the number of kids in Soda is 6277."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has in total.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.

"Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents for each sentence, so from Publisher A, he gets:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, so he gets:
\[ 10 \text{ cents/sentence} \]
So from Publisher B, he gets:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the amounts from both publishers:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day. The answer is 55 liters."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

John gets a $5000 reward and a 5% raise in his salary. His original salary is $2000 a week. First, we need to find out how much more he makes each week with the raise.

1. **Calculate the raise:**
   - 5% of $2000 is $2000 * 0.05 = $100.
   - So, his new weekly salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100.

2. **Calculate his total earnings for the year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - So, his total earnings for the year are $2100 * 52 = $109200.

3. **Add the reward to his total earnings:**
   - His total earnings for the year are $109200.
   - Plus the $5000 reward, so $109200 + $5000 = $114200.

So, the total amount of money John made that year is $114200."

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year. The answer is 100 barrels."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days. Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese. So, for sandwiches, he used:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \]

For breakfast, he ate omelets 3 days. Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses:
\[ 2 \text{ slices} + 1 \text{ slice} = 3 \text{ slices} \]
So, for omelets, he used:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

For dinner, he made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add all the slices together:
\[ 10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

So, Carl used a total of 27 slices of cheese. The correct answer is:

\[ 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, the score Brinley needs on her sixth test is 118. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{118} \]"
"To find out how many kilometers Micheal rode his bike in total, we need to break it down into two parts.

First, we look at the first four weeks:
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

Next, we look at the next three weeks:
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- So, in one week, he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

Now, we add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks:
- Total kilometers = \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

So, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To find out how much Joe's bag of candy weighs, we need to add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples together.

First, we know each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar. Since a chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, a candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Joe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams. The correct answer is:

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ cakes} \]

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cakes} \]

Now, let's add up all the cakes she bought over the three days:
\[ 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 \]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{76} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step in a simple way.

1. We know that half a dozen plates cost $6000. So, one plate costs $6000 divided by 6, which is $1000.
   
2. Now, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates. Half a dozen plates cost $6000, so twenty dozen cups cost $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

3. Twenty dozen cups mean 20 times 12 cups, so that's 240 cups. If 240 cups cost $4800, then one cup costs $4800 divided by 240.

4. To find out how much one cup costs, we do $4800 ÷ 240 = $20.

So, the cost of each cup is $20. 

The answer is: **$20**"
"Sara wants to buy a jacket that costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes, each costing $20. So, the total cost is $30 + 2 × $20 = $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 each time she babysits and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 × 4 = $20 from babysitting.

To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we subtract the money she earns from babysitting from the total money she needs: $60 - $20 = $40.

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, she needs to mow the lawn $40 ÷ $4 = 10 times.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Jerry has red chickens that lay 3 eggs a day and white chickens that lay 5 eggs a day. He collects 42 eggs every day. He has two more white chickens than red chickens.

First, let's say Jerry has \( r \) red chickens. Then he has \( r + 2 \) white chickens because he has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Each red chicken lays 3 eggs a day, so \( r \) red chickens will lay \( 3r \) eggs a day.
Each white chicken lays 5 eggs a day, so \( r + 2 \) white chickens will lay \( 5(r + 2) \) eggs a day.

The total number of eggs collected every day is the sum of the eggs laid by the red and white chickens:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 42 - 10 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to know the total distance he walks. The park is a rectangle that is 6 miles long and 1.5 miles wide. To find the total distance he walks, we add up all the sides of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. The next day, she counted 50 more than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

Now, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers.

So, 500 (total) - 100 (first day) - 150 (second day) = 250 customers on the third day.

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Let's solve this step by step.

We know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, if the small pool had \( S \) gallons of water 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 2S \) gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, each pool loses \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water.

So, the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S - 16 \) gallons, and the current amount of water in the big pool is \( 2S - 16 \) gallons.

Now, we know that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write the equation:

\[ 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]

Let's solve this equation:

\[ 2S - 16 = 4S - 64 \]

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 64 - 16 = 4S - 2S \]
\[ 48 = 2S \]
\[ S = 24 \]

So, the small pool now has 24 gallons of water.

The correct answer is: 24 gallons."
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first add the cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320 and the belt costs $32, so we add these together:

\[ 320 + 32 = 352 \]

Lori needs $352 to buy both the shoes and the belt. Since she earns $8.00 per hour at her job, we need to find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352. We do this by dividing $352 by $8.00:

\[ 352 \div 8 = 44 \]

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn $352. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an extra 10%. First, we need to find out how much extra she has to pay. We do this by calculating 10% of $2000:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Now, Janeth is paying $165 every month for 12 months. We need to find out how much she will pay in total over 12 months:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, to find out how much she still owes after 12 months, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:

\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is $220. 

The correct answer is: **$220**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. The problem says there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, to find out how many dahlias there are, we add 7 to the number of roses:

\[ 4 (roses) + 7 = 11 (dahlias) \]

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together:

\[ 4 (roses) + 11 (dahlias) = 15 (total flowers) \]

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. Harriet is 21 years old now.
2. Zack is twice as old as Harriet, so Zack is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so Adrian is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Now, in three years:
- Harriet will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age in three years, we add their ages and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

So, the average age of the three in three years is 45. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, let's break it down step by step:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half of what Naomi scored. So, we calculate half of 68 and then add 10:
   \[
   \text{Half of 68} = \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's score:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, Jojo's score can be found by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points. The correct answer is \boxed{54}."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time she spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.

So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both puzzles:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is 70 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden, so the tank has:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Then, she collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank, the total amount of water in the tank now is:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. So, he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. The total number of flowers he plants is 90 geraniums + 50 petunias = 140 flowers. 

So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140. 

The correct answer is 140."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The company spent $15000 on advertising in the first year.
2. In the second year, they spent a third of that amount. So, we calculate a third of $15000:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000
   \]
3. Now, we add the amounts from both years:
   \[
   15000 + 5000 = 20000
   \]

So, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000.

The correct answer is: **$20000**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Carlos and Benji.

First, we calculate how much Carlos pays for renting the canoe. The canoe costs $30 an hour, and Carlos uses it for 3 hours. So, we multiply:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

Carlos pays $90 for the canoe.

Next, we calculate how much Benji pays for renting the banana boat raft. The raft costs $18 an hour, and Benji uses it for 5 hours. So, we multiply:

\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]

Benji pays $90 for the raft.

Now, to find out how much they pay altogether, we add what Carlos pays and what Benji pays:

\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, Carlos and Benji will pay a total of $180 for their rentals.

The final answer is: **$180**"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. 

He also takes half as many days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. So, he takes \(6 \div 2 = 3\) days to travel by car.

Now, if he returns from Rochester to New Jersey by car, it will take him another 3 days.

So, the total number of days he will travel is the sum of the days for the trip to Rochester and the return trip:
\[6 \text{ days (to Rochester)} + 3 \text{ days (return)} = 9 \text{ days}\]

Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 9 days.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"James starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. So he has a total of:
\[ 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 \text{ cards} \]

Then he loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 more grass type cards. So the number of water type cards left is:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ water type cards} \]

Now, the total number of cards he has is:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 32 \text{ (water)} + 14 \text{ (grass)} = 76 \text{ total cards} \]

To find the percentage of water type cards, we use:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{76} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating this:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{76} \right) \times 100 \approx 42.11\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ 42\% \]

So the correct answer is:
\[ 42\% \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The base burrito costs $6.50.
2. Chad adds extra meat for $2.00.
3. He also adds extra cheese for $1.00.
4. He puts avocado for $1.00.
5. He adds 2 sauces at $0.25 each, so that's $0.25 * 2 = $0.50.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Chad then decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, which includes chips and a drink. Adding this to the previous total:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00 that he uses at checkout. Subtracting the value of the gift card from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

So, the amount Chad still owes is $9.00.

The final answer is: $9.00"
"To find out how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to finish the puzzle, we first need to know how many pieces they can put together in one minute. Kalinda can put 4 pieces in one minute, and her mom can put half as many pieces as Kalinda, which is 2 pieces in one minute. So together, they can put 4 + 2 = 6 pieces in one minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces, so to find out how many minutes it will take them to finish the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they can put together in one minute. That means 360 pieces divided by 6 pieces per minute equals 60 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes is the same as 1 hour. So, it will take them 1 hour to finish the puzzle.

The answer is: 1 hour."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The farm produced 120 watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of them were ready for harvest. So, we calculate 30% of 120:
   \[
   0.30 \times 120 = 36
   \]
   So, 36 watermelons were ready and Ashlyn took them home.
3. This means there were \(120 - 36 = 84\) watermelons left.
4. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready. So, we calculate 3/4 of 84:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
   \]
   So, 63 watermelons were ready.
5. The number of watermelons that were not ready is:
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21
   \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21. The answer is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. First, we calculate the total cost of the cars:

\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, he has to pay 10% tax on these cars. To find the tax:

\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

So, the total cost including tax is:

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Then, he has to pay $1,000 for registration on each car. For 12 cars, the total registration cost is:

\[ 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Adding the registration cost to the total cost including tax:

\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the total amount Mark pays is $276,000. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{276000} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On Monday, Robert collected 20 shells. Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so she collected:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ shells} \]

On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. So, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2:
\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \text{ shells} \]

Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, then the number of bugs is half of 50, which is 25. So, the total number of insects in the garden is the number of ants plus the number of bugs, which is 50 ants plus 25 bugs. That makes a total of 75 insects. 

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75. 

The correct answer is 75."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We start with 36 penguins. One-third of them jump into the ocean. To find out how many that is, we do:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins go into the ocean.

Next, another one-third go into the cave. Again, we do:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, we add the penguins that went into the ocean and the cave:

\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

So, 24 penguins are not sunbathing anymore.

To find out how many are still sunbathing, we subtract the number that went away from the total number:

\[ 36 - 24 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.

The answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day. His girlfriend eats half as much, so she eats 3 tomatoes a day. Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day. That means they eat 9 tomatoes * 7 days = 63 tomatoes a week. If one vine produces 3 tomatoes a week, then Steve needs 63 tomatoes / 3 tomatoes per vine = 21 vines. So, Steve needs 21 vines. The answer is 21."
"To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we can do the following:

First, we need to know how many slices of pizza John needs in total. Since he has 20 friends and each friend will have 4 slices, we multiply 20 by 4:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that each pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
\[ 80 \div 8 = 10 \]

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

The number of pizzas John needs to order is:
10"
"Ram starts with 25 pens. He can make a new pen by mixing the ink from 5 empty pens. So, if he uses all 25 pens to make new ones, he can make 25 ÷ 5 = 5 new pens. Adding these 5 new pens to the original 25 pens, he has a total of 25 + 5 = 30 pens. So, the total number of pens Ram gets is 30. The answer is 30."
"Johnny started with $20 and added $10 more, so he had $20 + $10 = $30. He then invested this money and it tripled. So, he had $30 * 3 = $90 after a year.

2. Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
3. Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, to find the sum of their ages:
Jessa's age: 20
Joan's age: 25

"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. We start with 1000 students in the hall.
2. 30% of the students went out through exit A. So, we calculate 30% of 1000:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

3. After 300 students went out through exit A, the number of students left is:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

4. Then, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining students went out through exit B. So, we calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 700:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.

5. The rest of the students went out through exit C. So, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

The final answer is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know John has 54 candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can find out how many candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2:
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we add 6 to Robert's candies to find out how many candies James has:
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. 

Dolly reads her own books and Pandora's book, so that's 2 + 1 = 3 books.
Pandora reads her own book and Dolly's books, so that's 1 + 2 = 3 books.

Now, if we add up all the books they read together, it's 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.

So, the total number of books they will collectively read is 6."
"Mike used to have 5 pen pals. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he has 3 pen pals left now. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike writes back to each of these 3 pen pals, so he also writes 30 pages a week. He can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we first convert the total number of pages into minutes:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we convert the total minutes into hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to add up all the minutes he used and then subtract that from his total plan.

First, Jason uses 15 minutes each day for his calls with his boss. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

He also used an extra 300 minutes for calls to other people. So, the total minutes he used is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. So, the minutes he has left are:

So, Jason has 250 minutes left. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby takes \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes 2 fries, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20

We have two aquariums. In the first aquarium, there are 4 snails. In the second aquarium, there are 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

The problem says that this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So, if we let the number of fish in each aquarium be \( F \), then the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \). According to the problem:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is 7. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The makeup artist charges $250 for each hour. She needs to do makeup for 4 days a week, and each day takes 6 hours. So, in one week, she works for:
\[ 4 \text{ days/week} \times 6 \text{ hours/day} = 24 \text{ hours/week} \]

For 5 weeks, she works:
\[ 24 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours} \]

Now, if she charges $250 for each hour, the total cost for 120 hours is:
\[ 120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

But she gives a 10% discount. So, the discount amount is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 30000 = 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

After giving the discount, the final amount Jean pays is:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jean pays **27000 dollars**."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to add up all the money Isabelle spent on the party supplies. She spent:

- $12 on ingredients for the cake
- $43 on birthday presents
- $15 on decorations
- $4 on invitations
- $22 on goodie bags

Let's add these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

Isabelle split this total cost evenly among her three parents. So, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ 96 \div 3 = 32 \]

Each person paid $32. 

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is 4 times 50 pounds, which is 200 pounds. Now, if one pound of onions costs $1.50, then 200 pounds will cost 200 times $1.50. 

\[ 200 \times 1.50 = 300 \]

So, the chef spent $300. 

The correct answer is **300**."
"Let's break it down step by step:

First, we know how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day:
- On Monday, she ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, she ate 13 cookies.

Now, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister, so \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we add up how many cookies Sue ate in total:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total for Sue: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Now, we calculate how many cookies Sue's sister ate in total:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total for Sue's sister: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, we calculate the total calories for each:
- Sue's calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories
- Sue's sister's calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract:
- \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister. The answer is 5600 calories."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We know there are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students. So, the school has a total of 60 students.
2. Since the school is split evenly between boys and girls, there are 30 boys and 30 girls in total.
3. The first class has 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is \(20 - 15 = 5\).
4. The second class has 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is \(20 - 12 = 8\).
5. Now, we need to find out how many boys are in the third class. We know the total number of boys in the school is 30. So, the number of boys in the third class is \(30 - (5 + 8) = 30 - 13 = 17\).

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is 17. The answer is 17."
"Travis started with 61 apps. He deleted 9 apps, so he had:

\[ 61 - 9 = 52 \]

Then, he added 18 more apps, so now he has:

\[ 52 + 18 = 70 \]

So, the number of apps on his tablet now is 70."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, that's 10 + 15 = 25 animals.

Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed \( x \) cougars today. Then he killed 3 times \( x \) wolves, which is 3x wolves.

He also killed 3 fewer cougars than the previous night. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, today he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.

So, if he killed 12 cougars today, he must have killed 3 times that number of wolves, which is 3 * 12 = 36 wolves.

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

So, the total number of animals he killed is 25 + 48 = 73 animals.

The final answer is 73."
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. He goes up to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor plus 6. So, we calculate \(4 \times 3 = 12\), and then add 6 to that, which gives us \(12 + 6 = 18\). Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

The final answer is:
\[ \text{18} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply:

Mitchell went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than Mitchell. So, we first find out how much less than 30 that is. 30% of 30 is 9 (because 30 times 0.30 equals 9). So, Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Robert went down the slide 4 times as many times as Anne. So, we multiply 21 by 4 to find out how many times Robert went down. 21 times 4 is 84.

So, Robert went down the slide 84 times.

The answer is 84."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows is:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Then, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. The total number of cows now is:
\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

These 40 new cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, the number of cows in 8 stalls is:
\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 16. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Brady has different types of money in his piggy bank:
- 100 pennies, and each penny is worth $0.01.
- 40 nickels, and each nickel is worth $0.05.
- 20 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10.
- 40 dollar bills, and each dollar bill is worth $1.00.

First, let's calculate the total value of each type of money:
- The value of the pennies is \(100 \times 0.01 = 1.00\) dollars.
- The value of the nickels is \(40 \times 0.05 = 2.00\) dollars.
- The value of the dimes is \(20 \times 0.10 = 2.00\) dollars.
- The value of the dollar bills is \(40 \times 1.00 = 40.00\) dollars.

Now, let's add all these values together:
\[1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00\]

So, Brady has a total of $45.00 in his piggy bank.

The final answer is \(\boxed{45.00}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. The redwood tree is 200 feet tall.
2. Each 10-foot section of the tree weighs 400 pounds.
3. So, to find out how many sections there are, we divide the total height by the length of each section: \(200 \div 10 = 20\) sections.
4. Now, if each section weighs 400 pounds, then the whole tree weighs \(20 \times 400 = 8000\) pounds.
5. But termites ate 30% of the tree, so 70% of the tree remains.
6. To find out how much 70% of 8000 pounds is, we calculate \(8000 \times 0.70 = 5600\) pounds.

So, the redwood tree weighs 5600 pounds after the termites ate some of it. The answer is 5600 pounds."
"To find out how much Nancy has to pay, we need to add up the cost of the overdue books and the flat fee.

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books. Nancy has 8 books overdue, and each book costs $0.50. So, we multiply 8 by $0.50:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book overdue:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00.

The correct answer is: **$6.00**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has \(48 / 2 = 24\) bananas, which we already knew from the first step.

Now, let's add up all the fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so that's \(52 + 24 = 76\) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so that's \(44 + 48 = 92\) fruits.

Adding Andrea's and Jamal's fruits together:
\[76 + 92 = 168\]

So, the total number of fruits is 168. The correct answer is 168."
"To find out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to know how many cookies she's making in total. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so in total she's making:

\[36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies}\]

Now, we know that 2 cups of flour make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour she needs for 66 cookies, we can set up a simple ratio:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

To find \(x\), we solve the equation:

\[ x = \frac{2 \times 66}{12} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

So, Carla needs 11 cups of flour to make 66 cookies. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have 9,300 pennies in a cup. We need to find out how many pennies are in a stack that has two thirds of the pennies in the cup.

First, we calculate two thirds of 9,300 pennies:
\[ 9300 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6200 \text{ pennies} \]

Now, we need to know how many dollars 6200 pennies are. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we divide 6200 by 100:
\[ 6200 \div 100 = 62 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total dollar amount in the stack is 62 dollars.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{62} \]"
"Maddison starts with 5 boxes of marbles, and each box has 50 marbles. So, she has:

\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \text{ marbles} \]

Then she gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So, the total number of marbles she has now is:

\[ 250 + 20 = 270 \text{ marbles} \]

The final answer is 270 marbles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Chris has 6 trees in his yard.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees Chris has, so:
\[ \text{Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has. So:
\[ \text{Twice Ferdinand's trees} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
\[ \text{Harry's trees} = 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:
\[ \text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ 100 + 25 = 125 \]
Samantha has $125.

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ 125 + 50 = 175 \]
Daisy has $175.

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their money together:
\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \]

So, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mrs. Cruz wants to buy a house that doesn't cost more than $400,000. She found a house that costs $350,000. But there are extra costs she has to pay:

1. A 5% brokerage fee on the $350,000 price. To find this, we calculate 5% of $350,000:
   \[ 5\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

2. A 12% transfer fee on the $350,000 price. To find this, we calculate 12% of $350,000:
   \[ 12\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total cost:
\[ 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

So, the total cost of the house is $409,500. Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the house costs than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total cost:
\[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

The answer is: $9,500"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some fees and a loan. Here's how we can figure out how much he got after all that:

1. He paid 3% of $400,000 as transfer fees. That's:
   \[
   0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. He also paid 5% of $400,000 as a brokerage fee. That's:
   \[
   0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. So, the total fees he paid are:
   \[
   12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. After paying the fees, he got:
   \[
   400,000 - 32,000 = 368,000
   \]

5. But he still had to pay $250,000 for the remaining loan. So, after paying the loan:
   \[
   368,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
   \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000. 

The correct answer is: **$118,000**"
"To find out how much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, let's break it down step by step:

1. It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.
2. To heat the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes. So, 40% of 20 minutes is:
   \[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]
   Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
   \[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]
3. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to warm the oil. So, the cooking time is:
   \[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add up all the times:
\[ 20 \text{ (heating to 300 degrees)} + 28 \text{ (heating to 400 degrees)} + 23 \text{ (cooking)} = 71 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 71 minutes. The answer is 71 minutes."
"To find out how much the real estate agent spent in total, we need to add up the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads.

First, let's calculate the cost of the newspaper ads:
- He spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- He bought 50 newspaper ads.

So, the total cost for newspaper ads is:
\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the television ads:
- He spent $75 on each television ad.
- He bought 15 television ads.

So, the total cost for television ads is:
\[ 75 \times 15 = 1125 \]

Now, we add the total cost of newspaper ads and television ads to find the total amount spent:
\[ 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

So, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads. The answer is $1375."
"To find out how many blue golf balls there are, we can do the following steps:

1. We know the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total.
2. Half of these balls are golf balls. So, we divide 16 by 2:
   \[
   16 \div 2 = 8
   \]
   So, there are 8 golf balls.
3. Now, half of these golf balls are blue. So, we divide 8 by 2:
   \[
   8 \div 2 = 4
   \]
   So, there are 4 blue golf balls.

Therefore, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"Mary bought 3 bags of M&Ms. Let's count them one by one.

First, the first bag has 300 M&Ms.
Second, the second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
Third, the third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has \(300 \div 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, Mary got a total of 762 M&Ms. The correct answer is 762."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

John has 2 houses. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, in one house, the number of windows in the bedrooms is:
\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows} \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
\[ 6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows} \]

Each house also has 4 windows that are not connected to the bedrooms. So, for both houses, the total number of these windows is:
\[ 4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows:
\[ 12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

So, the total number of windows between the two houses is 20. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how much change the mother gets back, we first need to add up the cost of all the items she bought.

The cost of the cocoa is $4.20.
The cost of the laundry is $9.45.
The cost of the package of pasta is $1.35.

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find out how much change she gets back, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:
\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

First, we know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that, so:
\[ \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
\[ \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, we add up the stitches for the collar and the rosette:
\[ 90 + 180 = 270 \]

The whole sweater is 1800 stitches. So, the stitches for the sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2:
\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \]

So, each sleeve takes 765 stitches. The answer is \(\boxed{765}\)."
"Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds at $40 each, so the total cost for the tomato seeds is:
\[ 20 \times 40 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

She also bought 80 packets of celery seeds at $30 each, so the total cost for the celery seeds is:
\[ 80 \times 30 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money she used in total, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds:
\[ 800 + 2400 = 3200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:
\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sean has to memorize 54 lines for his solo song.
2. For the first scene, the number of lines is twice the number of lines in the solo song. So, the first scene has \(2 \times 54 = 108\) lines.
3. Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines. So, Sean has \( \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \) lines for the first scene.
4. For the second scene, the number of lines is six more than the solo song. So, the second scene has \(54 + 6 = 60\) lines.
5. Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines. So, Sean has \( \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \) lines for the second scene.

Now, let's add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
- Solo song: 54 lines
- First scene: 36 lines
- Second scene: 48 lines

So, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \(54 + 36 + 48 = 138\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{138}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Carly started with 80 cards.

1. First, we find out how many cards had the letter A. Since 2 out of every 5 cards had A, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32
   \]
   So, 32 cards had the letter A.

2. After taking out the 32 cards with A, we have:
   \[
   80 - 32 = 48
   \]
   cards left.

3. Next, we find out how many of these 48 cards had the letter B. Since half of the remaining cards had B, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
   \]
   So, 24 cards had the letter B.

4. After taking out the 24 cards with B, we have:
   \[
   48 - 24 = 24
   \]
   cards left.

5. Now, we find out how many of these 24 cards had the letter C. Since 5 out of every 8 cards had C, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = \frac{120}{8} = 15
   \]
   So, 15 cards had the letter C.

6. After taking out the 15 cards with C, we have:
   \[
   24 - 15 = 9
   \]
   cards left.

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 9. The answer is 9."
"To find out how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

So, the time for small holes is:
\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

So, the time for large holes is:
\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for both types of holes:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. The answer is 4 hours."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Mico and Marco's current ages add up to 20. So, if we want to know their ages in 10 years, we need to add 10 years to each of their current ages.

If Mico is \( M \) years old now, in 10 years he will be \( M + 10 \) years old.
If Marco is \( R \) years old now, in 10 years he will be \( R + 10 \) years old.

The total sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

We know that \( M + R = 20 \), so we can substitute 20 for \( M + R \):
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. So if Sam is \( S \) years old, Ruby is \( 6S \) years old.
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be \( 6S + 9 \) years old, and Sam will be \( S + 9 \) years old.
3. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So we can write the equation:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
   \]
4. Now let's solve this equation step by step:
   \[
   6S + 9 = 3S + 27
   \]
   Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
   \[
   3S + 9 = 27
   \]
   Subtract 9 from both sides:
   \[
   3S = 18
   \]
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   S = 6
   \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The answer is: \(\boxed{6}\)"
"Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so the popsicles cost him:
\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

He also bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so the ice cream bars cost him:
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much he paid in total, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Peter paid a total of **7 dollars**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know a cobra has 70 spots. A mamba has half that number, so a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

Now, there are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots, so all the cobras together have 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots, so all the mambas together have 60 * 35 = 2100 spots.

Adding the spots of all the cobras and mambas together, we get 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots in total.

To find half of this total, we divide 4900 by 2, which gives us 4900 / 2 = 2450.

So, the final answer is 2450."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many people are at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's 12 team members * 2 guests/team member = 24 guests. Adding all these together, we get 12 team members + 3 coaches + 24 guests = 39 people.

2. Now, we need to figure out how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy. Each pizza can serve 3 people. So, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve: 39 people ÷ 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

3. Each pizza costs $15. So, to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost of each pizza: 13 pizzas * $15 per pizza = $195.

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195 on pizzas. The answer is $195."
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know that each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and she uses 8 of them. So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. So, the length left for the sterling silver beads is:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find out how many beads fit into 17 inches, we divide:
   \[
   17 \text{ inches} \div 0.25 \text{ inches/bead} = 68 \text{ beads}
   \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace. The answer is 68."
"To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether, we can follow these steps:

First, let's look at how many stories each person wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories.

Now, let's add these up to find the total for the first week:
\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \]
So, they wrote 120 stories in the first week.

Next, let's see how many stories each person wrote in the second week. They each doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories in the second week.
- Braylen wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories in the second week.
- Margot wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories in the second week.

Now, let's add these up to find the total for the second week:
\[ 40 + 80 + 120 = 240 \]
So, they wrote 240 stories in the second week.

Finally, to find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the stories from the first and second weeks:
\[ 120 + 240 = 360 \]

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{360}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a better understanding.

Ann is 9 years old. Her brother is twice her age, so we calculate her brother's age as follows:
\[ 2 \times 9 = 18 \]
So, her brother is 18 years old.

Now, we want to know how old her brother will be in 3 years. We add 3 years to his current age:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 21 years old.

The final answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Kelly starts with 5 quarters and 2 dimes. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters are worth:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes are worth:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these together, Kelly has:
\[ 125 + 20 = 145 \text{ cents} \]

She buys a can of pop for 55 cents, so the money left is:
\[ 145 - 55 = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know the flag has a total of 76 stars.
2. There are 3 rows with 8 stars each, so that's 3 rows * 8 stars/row = 24 stars.
3. There are 2 rows with 6 stars each, so that's 2 rows * 6 stars/row = 12 stars.
4. Now, let's add the stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars: 24 stars + 12 stars = 36 stars.
5. To find out how many stars are left for the rows of 5 stars, we subtract the stars in the other rows from the total: 76 stars - 36 stars = 40 stars.
6. Since each row of 5 stars has 5 stars, we divide the remaining stars by 5: 40 stars / 5 stars/row = 8 rows.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars. The answer is 8."
"To find out how many trucks are needed, we first calculate the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know each truck can carry 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed to carry 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

So, we need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour and it traveled 480 miles. To find out how long it took, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   So, the time it took is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. Now, the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the fast lane, so it's traveling at 30 miles per hour. To find out how long it took to travel the same 480 miles, we use the same formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
   \]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance. The answer is 16 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Ali has 22 medals. His friend Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has:
\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \text{ medals} \]

Together, Ali and Izzy have:
\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \text{ medals} \]

The problem says that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. So, we calculate:
\[ 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:
\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ bars per packet} = 40 \text{ bars} \]

Next, we know that 4 adults are sharing the chocolate bars, and each adult gets 6 bars. So, the total number of bars the adults get is:

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ bars per adult} = 24 \text{ bars} \]

Now, we subtract the bars the adults get from the total number of bars to find out how many bars are left for the children:

\[ 40 \text{ bars} - 24 \text{ bars} = 16 \text{ bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 bars equally among them. So, each child gets:

\[ \frac{16 \text{ bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bars per child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Susan works for 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. But she takes a 30-minute break, so she actually works for 150 minutes.

She earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns per minute, we divide $5 by 10, which gives us $0.5 per minute.

Now, to find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we multiply 150 by $0.5. So, 150 times $0.5 is $75.

Therefore, the amount of money Susan earns is $75."
"Okay, let's go through this step by step like I'm in primary school.

1. In the first three rounds:
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. In the fourth round:
   - Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

3. Now, let's add the extra point to Tony's total:
   - Mike's total: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
   - Jim's total: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
   - Tony's total: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

4. To find the total points of all three players:
   - Mike's points: 21
   - Jim's points: 18
   - Tony's points: 43
   - Total points: \(21 + 18 + 43 = 82\)

So, the total points that all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is 82."
"Will bought 15 oranges. His two sons washed as many oranges as their ages. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 4 years old.

The oldest son washed 8 oranges, and the youngest son washed 4 oranges. So, the total number of oranges washed is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Now, to find out how many oranges are left unwashed, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the number of oranges left unwashed is 3. The correct answer is:

3"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

On the first day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Double the number of dumbbell presses, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up all the activities over the two days:

For pushups:
100 (first day) + 120 (second day) = 220 pushups

For squats:
50 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 90 squats

For dumbbell presses:
20 (first day) + 40 (second day) = 60 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add them all together:
220 pushups + 90 squats + 60 dumbbell presses = 370

So, the total count of the activities he did in the two days is 370."
"To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to figure out how much rice the family eats in a week.

Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 people in the family. They eat rice at lunch and dinner, so that's 2 meals a day.

First, let's find out how much rice the family eats in one day:
- Each person eats 0.2 kg per meal.
- There are 5 people.
- They eat 2 meals a day (lunch and dinner).

So, the family eats:
\[ 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much rice they eat in a week. There are 7 days in a week:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we know the family eats 14 kg of rice in a week. We have a 42 kg bag of rice. To find out how many weeks the bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.

The answer is: 3 weeks"
"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, let's add up all the crates he sold during the week.

He sold:
- 15 crates on Tuesday
- 12 crates on Wednesday
- 18 crates on Thursday
- 20 crates over the weekend

First, let's add the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 \]

Now, add the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To find out how much Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to add up all her bids. Let's break it down:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many miles John drives in a year. He drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so that's 60 miles each day. He does this 5 days a week, so that's 300 miles a week. There are 50 weeks in a year, so he drives 15,000 miles in a year (300 miles/week * 50 weeks).

Next, we need to find out how much he pays for driving these miles. He pays $2 for each mile, so for 15,000 miles, he pays 30,000 dollars (15,000 miles * $2/mile).

Now, we need to add the bonus. He gets $150 a month, and there are 12 months in a year, so he gets $1,800 in bonuses (150 dollars/month * 12 months).

So, the total cost for the year is the cost of the miles plus the bonus, which is 30,000 dollars + 1,800 dollars = 31,800 dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is **31,800 dollars**."
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first add the minutes he exercised on Monday and Sunday. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. So, we add these two numbers together:

\[ 23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount of time on Tuesday. So, we multiply 39 by 2:

\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday. The answer is 78 minutes."
"To figure out how many pieces of paper are needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's think about it step by step.

1. When you fold a piece of paper in half vertically, you can print 4 pages on it. Two pages on the front and two pages on the back.
2. So, each piece of paper can print 4 pages.
3. Now, we need to print 32 pages in total.
4. To find out how many pieces of paper we need, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages we can print on one piece of paper. That is, \(32 \div 4 = 8\).

So, we need 8 pieces of paper to print a 32-page tabloid.

The answer is 8."
"Let's break it down step by step:

Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks. Half of $50 is $25. So, she spent $25 on food and snacks.

After spending $25, she had:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars left} \]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, we subtract $10 from the $25 she had left:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Annika is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Elise has 250 books in total. At the end of the year, she has 50 books left unsold. So, she sold 200 books this year.

She sold 45 books this year. In the first year, she sold twice as many as this year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.

Now, let's add up the books sold over the three years:
- First year: 90 books
- Second year: 45 books
- Third year: 200 books

Total books sold = 90 + 45 + 200 = 335 books. But she only had 250 books, so she sold all the books over the three years.

Each book sells for $20. So, the money she earned in the second year is:
45 books × $20/book = $900

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $900. The answer is $900."
"To find out how much money Watson made in April, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate how much Watson earns in a week. He works 10 hours a day and gets paid $10 for each hour. So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. So, his total weekly earnings are:
\[ 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

April has 30 days, and there are about 4 full weeks in April. So, we calculate his earnings for 4 weeks:
\[ 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Since the company performed very well for the whole month, he gets the $300 bonus for each of the 4 weeks:
\[ 300 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 1200 \, \text{\$} \]

Now, we add his total earnings from his hourly wage and the total bonus to find his total earnings for April:
\[ 3200 \, \text{\$} + 1200 \, \text{\$} = 4400 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:
\[ \boxed{4400} \]"
"John played arm wrestle with 20 people. He beat 80% of them. To find out how many he lost to, we first need to know how many he beat. 80% of 20 is calculated as follows:

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{80}{100} \times 20 = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. To find out how many he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he played against:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day. In the morning, they sell 2/3 of these loaves. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

This means 40 loaves are sold in the morning. Now, we subtract these from the total:

\[
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

These 20 loaves are left for the afternoon and evening. In the afternoon and evening, they sell half of these remaining loaves equally. So, we find half of 20:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

So, 10 loaves are sold in the afternoon. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. So, to find out how much Joey loses in one week, we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:
\[ 8 \div 4 = 2 \text{ pounds per week} \]

Now, Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight as Joey in 4 weeks. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks).

If Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, then the answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how much you save, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the ice cream:
- The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13.
- The discounted price of one tub of ice cream is $11.
- So, you save $13 - $11 = $2 on one tub of ice cream.

Since you are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's look at the milk:
- The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- So, you save $0.5 on one packet of milk.

Since you are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, to find the total savings, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings = $4 + $2 = $6

So, the total amount you will save is $6."
"To figure out how many new limbs the serum will cause after 15 days, we need to count how many times the person gets an extra arm and an extra leg.

- The person gets an extra arm every 3 days. In 15 days, we can count how many 3-day periods there are: \(15 \div 3 = 5\). So, the person gets 5 extra arms.
- The person gets an extra leg every 5 days. In 15 days, we can count how many 5-day periods there are: \(15 \div 5 = 3\). So, the person gets 3 extra legs.

Now, to find the total number of new limbs, we add the extra arms and extra legs together:
\[ 5 \text{ (extra arms)} + 3 \text{ (extra legs)} = 8 \text{ (total new limbs)} \]

So, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Theo has $6000 for his trip. He spends money on:
- 6 business suits at $100 each, so that's 6 * $100 = $600.
- 3 suitcases at $50 each, so that's 3 * $50 = $150.
- A flight ticket that costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that is $500, and $700 more is $500 + $700 = $1200.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
- Business suits: $600
- Suitcases: $150
- Flight ticket: $1200

Total spent so far: $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950.

Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the rest he can spend is:
- Total money - Money saved = $6000 - $2000 = $4000.

Now, subtract the money spent on business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the rest:
- Money left - Money spent on other things = $4000 - $1950 = $2050.

So, Theo has $2050 left to spend on gifts for his business partners. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have a family of 5 people. Three of them eat 3 eggs each day, and the other two eat 2 eggs each day.

First, let's find out how many eggs the three people eat in a day:
- Each of the three people eats 3 eggs, so together they eat \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.

Next, let's find out how many eggs the other two people eat in a day:
- Each of the two people eats 2 eggs, so together they eat \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add these together to find out how many eggs the whole family eats in a day:
- Total eggs per day = Eggs eaten by the three people + Eggs eaten by the two people
- Total eggs per day = \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, to find out how many eggs they eat in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily total by 7:
- Total eggs in a week = Total eggs per day \(\times\) 7
- Total eggs in a week = \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week. The correct answer is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We know Quinn is 30 years old. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so we calculate Jane's age:
\[ 30 - 3 = 27 \]
Jane is 27 years old.

Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age:
\[ 27 + 5 = 32 \]
Trent is 32 years old.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Six years ago, Cera was 40 years old (46 - 6). At that time, Noah was half her age, so Noah was 20 years old (40 / 2).

Now, Noah is 26 years old (20 + 6).

Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now. If Noah was 20 years old then, the population of Chile was 3000 times his age, which is 60000 (20 * 3000).

So, six years ago, the population of Chile was 60000. Now, it must be double that because it was half of what it is now, so the current population is 120000.

But we know the population six years ago was 60000, which is half of the current population. So, the current population is double that, which is 120000 * 2 = 240000.

Therefore, the population of Chile now is 240000.

The correct answer is: **240000**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the total number of players on the team is 105. Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).

According to the problem:
- The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, so it's \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense, so it's \( \frac{D}{2} \).

So, the total number of players is:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier, let's combine the terms:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So, we have:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The answer is: **30**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people.
She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 people.
So, in total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, 8 people couldn't come because they were sick.
And 1/4 of those 8 people couldn't come because of other reasons, so 8 / 4 = 2 people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8 + 2 = 10.

Therefore, the number of people who showed up is 24 - 10 = 14.

The final answer is 14."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. He also got 2/5 times as many marbles from his father. First, we need to find out how many marbles his father gave him.

To find out how many marbles his father gave him, we do:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \]

So, his father gave him 8 marbles. Now, we add the marbles he got from Johanna and his father together:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \]

So, Solomon has 28 marbles in total. Each marble weighs 2 kg. To find the total weight of all the marbles, we multiply the number of marbles by the weight of each marble:
\[ 28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ kg} \]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is 56 kg. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{56}

"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we first need to know how much water the pool can hold. The pool is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. To find the volume, we multiply these three numbers together:

\[ 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it costs $0.1 to fill one cubic foot of the pool. So, to find the total cost, we multiply the number of cubic feet by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know there are 30 boys in the classroom. The problem tells us there are 3 times as many girls as boys. So, we calculate the number of girls:

\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 girls.

Next, the problem says there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. So, we calculate the number of nongendered children:

\[ \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

So, there are 3 nongendered children.

Now, to find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

\[ 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123.

The correct answer is 123."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires.

We are given that the total number of wires is 45. To find out how many poles we need, we can use the ratio.

If 3 wires correspond to 1 pole, then we can find out how many poles we need by dividing the total number of wires by 3.

So, we do:
\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{\text{Total number of wires}}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The answer is: 15"
"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. At the start, there were 25 men and 15 women.
2. So, the total number of people at the start was \(25 + 15 = 40\).
3. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, \(1/4 \times 40 = 10\) people left.
4. This means \(40 - 10 = 30\) people stayed.
5. We know that 22 men stayed at the party. So, the number of women who stayed is \(30 - 22 = 8\).

So, the number of women left at the party is 8.

The correct answer is 8."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know a book costs $4. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

So, the magazine costs $2.

Now, the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find out how many boxes Jam and Meg need, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Jam has 26 pencils in total. This includes 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils. So, each box must have 8 pencils because \(3 \times 8 + 2 = 26\).

Now, we know Meg has 46 pencils.

To find out the total number of pencils they have together, we add Jam's and Meg's pencils:
\[26 + 46 = 72\]

Each box can hold 8 pencils. To find out how many boxes they need, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[72 \div 8 = 9\]

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The answer is 9."
"To figure out how many milliliters weaker the iced coffee is, we need to think about two things: how the ice cubes cool the coffee and how the cream affects it.

First, let's look at the ice cubes. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker and cools it by 13 degrees. If we want to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need to find out how many ice cubes we need. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13 to find out how many ice cubes we need:

\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \]

So, we need 5 ice cubes. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Now, we need to add the cream. Adding cream doesn't change how much weaker the coffee is, it just adds more liquid to the cup. So, the 60 milliliters weaker is the final answer.

The iced coffee is 60 milliliters weaker. So, the correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

Ralph's store has a rule: 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. Now, 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records. We need to find out how many old records they brought in.

First, we know that for every 1 new record, you need 2 old records. So, for 7 new records, you need:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

The answer is: **14**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. The company has 100 people working there.
2. Junior programmers make $2000 a month.
3. There are 40 junior programmers because 2/5 of 100 is 40.
4. So, the total money paid to junior programmers is 40 times $2000, which is $80000.
5. Senior programmers make $2000 + $400 = $2400 a month.
6. There are 60 senior programmers because 100 - 40 = 60.
7. So, the total money paid to senior programmers is 60 times $2400, which is $144000.
8. To find the total money paid to all programmers, we add the money paid to junior and senior programmers: $80000 + $144000 = $224000.

So, the company pays a total of $224000 to all the programmers per month. The answer is $224000."
"Let's solve this step by step.

We start with \( x \) people at the terminal. At the first stop, 5 more people get on, so the bus now has \( x + 5 \) people.

At the second stop, 7 people get off and 8 more get on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after the second stop, there are 20 people on the bus. So we can write:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's count the lollipops Oscar has step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

3. He gives 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which is \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

The final answer is 31."
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charging needed, which is 40%.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point every 3 minutes. So, to charge 40 percentage points, we multiply 40 by 3 minutes:

\[
40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to convert 120 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[
120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a shopping trip where the customer spent $43.

1. First, we need to know how many rewards the customer gets for spending $80. For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase. So, for $80, they get:
   \[
   \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards}
   \]
   This means they get 4 dollars off their next purchase.

2. For the shopping trip where they spent $43, they use these 4 rewards. Each reward is worth $1, so using 4 rewards means they get $4 off their purchase.

3. Now, they also have a coupon that takes twice the amount of rewards off the price. So, the coupon takes off:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. To find out how much they paid, we subtract the rewards and the coupon from the original price:
   \[
   43 - 4 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Job A and Job B.

For Job A:
- Nick works 2000 hours a year at $15 per hour.
- Total pay before tax = 2000 hours * $15/hour = $30,000
- The state tax is 20% of $30,000, so the tax is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- So, the net pay for Job A = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Nick gets $42,000 a year.
- The state charges $6,000 in property tax.
- So, the net income after property tax = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- The state then charges 10% tax on the net income after property tax.
- So, the tax on net income = $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- So, the net pay for Job B = $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, to find out how much more money Nick makes at the job with the higher net pay rate:
- The difference in net pay = $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate. The answer is $8,400."
"To find out how many unmanned ruined castles there are in Scotland, we can do the following steps:

1. First, we need to find out how many castles are ruined. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruined.
   - 40 percent of 220 is calculated as 0.40 * 220 = 88.
   - So, there are 88 ruined castles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned.
   - Half of 88 is calculated as 88 / 2 = 44.
   - So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles.

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44.

The correct answer is 44."
"To find out how much more Furniture United's offer costs compared to Cozy Homes', we need to add up the costs for each offer and then find the difference.

**Furniture United's Offer:**
- They ask for $1,350 upfront.
- Then they ask for 6 monthly payments of $350 each.
- So, the total for the monthly payments is $350 * 6 = $2,100.
- Adding the upfront payment and the monthly payments gives us $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

**Cozy Homes' Offer:**
- They ask for $1,100 upfront.
- Then they ask for 9 monthly payments of $250 each.
- So, the total for the monthly payments is $250 * 9 = $2,250.
- Adding the upfront payment and the monthly payments gives us $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, to find out how much more Furniture United's offer costs, we subtract the cost of Cozy Homes' offer from the cost of Furniture United's offer:
- $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

So, the cost difference is $100. The answer is $100."
"To find out how many guns each person would have if they share them equally, we first need to add up all the guns they have together.

- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Adding these up: \(8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24\) guns in total.

Now, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 people. So, we divide 24 by 4:

\[ 24 \div 4 = 6 \]

So, each person would have 6 guns if they share them equally.

The final answer is: 6 guns."
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we first calculate the sugar for the suckers and the fudge separately.

For the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers needs 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason wants to make 8 batches of suckers.
So, the sugar needed for the suckers is:
\[ 8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ ounces} \]

For the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge needs 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason wants to make 1 batch of fudge.
So, the sugar needed for the fudge is:
\[ 1 \times 70 = 70 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together:
\[ 240 + 70 = 310 \text{ ounces} \]

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{310} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way:

1. Maria buys 8 shares at $8 each. So, the total money she spends is:
   \[
   8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64
   \]

2. The price of each share increases by 50% in the first year. So, the new price of each share is:
   \[
   \$8 + 50\% \times \$8 = \$8 + \$4 = \$12
   \]
   Now, with 8 shares at $12 each, the total value is:
   \[
   8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96
   \]

3. In the second year, the price of each share decreases by 25%. So, the new price of each share is:
   \[
   \$12 - 25\% \times \$12 = \$12 - \$3 = \$9
   \]
   Now, with 8 shares at $9 each, the total value is:
   \[
   8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72
   \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[
\boxed{72}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply:

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
Thomas ate three times more than Luke, so Thomas ate \(3 \times 2 = 6\) hot dogs.
John ate half the amount Thomas ate, so John ate \(6 \div 2 = 3\) hot dogs.

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:
\[3 - 2 = 1\]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The answer is 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have a class of 200 students split into 3 groups. Two of these groups are the same size, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's say each of the two equal groups has \( x \) students. So, the third group will have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students is 200, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The third group, which is the smallest, will have:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The correct answer is 60."
"Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's figure out how many cows and chickens he has.

If we let the number of cows be \( C \), then the number of chickens is \( 2C \) because he has twice as many chickens as cows. The total number of animals is the sum of cows and chickens, so:

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows. Since he has twice as many chickens, he has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
chickens.

Now, let's count the legs. Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have:

\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]
legs.

Each chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]
legs.

Adding the legs of cows and chickens together gives:

\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he adds 4 more balls. So, he has 3 + 4 = 7 balls in total. But when he drops 3 balls, he loses them. So, he has 7 - 3 = 4 balls left. 

So, with a sigh, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 4 balls. 

The number of balls Josh has left to juggle is 4. 

The answer is: 4"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it's also 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it's also 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it's 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it's 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
6. Now, we add up the weights of all these animals and the container:
   - Pink frog: 50 pounds
   - Blue beetle: 50 pounds
   - Green toad: 50 pounds
   - Yellow snake: 60 pounds
   - Red bird: 30 pounds
   - Container: 20 pounds

Adding these together: 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds.

So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
2. At her baby shower, she got twice as many as her friend gave her. So, she got \(2 \times 24 = 48\) outfits.
3. Her mom gave her 15 more outfits.

Now, we add all these outfits together:
\[ 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 \]

So, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby. The correct answer is 87."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Tyson usually runs 5000 meters a day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters. So, we first find out how much more he should run:

\[ 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, we add this to the usual distance he runs:

\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

So, Tyson will run 6000 meters each day. Now, we need to find out how many meters he runs in a month. June has 30 days, so:

\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{180000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Juice Boxes:

1. Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.
2. Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
   \[
   4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
   \[
   4 + 7 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B:
\[
11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Juice Box C costs 2 dollars more than Juice Box B. The answer is 2 dollars."
"To find the total number of legs on all the tables, we need to add the legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs.

First, let's calculate the legs from the 40 tables with 4 legs:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Next, let's calculate the legs from the 50 tables with 3 legs:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"Jenny buys 36 cookies a week. She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week, so that's 4 times 5, which is 20 cookies. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 times 7, which is 7 cookies. Now, we need to find out how many cookies are left for Jenny. We start with 36 cookies and subtract the 20 cookies for her son and the 7 cookies for her husband. 

So, 36 minus 20 is 16, and then 16 minus 7 is 9. 

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies. 

The answer is: 9"
"Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30. With a 40% discount, we first find out the total cost without the discount:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the discount amount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Davos paid, we subtract the discount from the total cost:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Davos paid **36 dollars** for the 2 shirts."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

When they made tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

So, the total money they made from selling tractors each day was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Now, they make silos instead:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

So, the total money they make from selling silos each day is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

To find out how much more money they make now compared to before, we subtract the old amount from the new amount:
\[ \$1100/\text{day} - \$1000/\text{day} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out what percentage this increase is of the old amount, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New amount} - \text{Old amount}}{\text{Old amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100/\text{day} - \$1000/\text{day}}{\$1000/\text{day}} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100/\text{day}}{\$1000/\text{day}} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \frac{1}{10} \times 100\% = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more money per day now. The answer is 10%."
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to add up all the costs for the year.

First, let's find out how much she spends on food, treats, and medicine each month.

- Food costs $25 per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so:
  \[
  25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ dollars per month for food}
  \]

- Treats cost $20 per month.

- Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, let's add up the monthly costs:
\[
100 \text{ (food)} + 20 \text{ (treats)} + 100 \text{ (medicine)} = 120 \text{ dollars per month}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much she spends in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[
120 \times 12 = 1440 \text{ dollars per year}
\]

So, Madeline spends 1440 dollars on her dog per year. The correct answer is 1440 dollars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the after-work activities Peyton has planned:

1. Monday: Yoga class is 1 hour.
2. Tuesday: Cooking class is 3 times the yoga class, so it's 3 hours.
3. Wednesday: Cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours.
4. Thursday: Museum tour is half the cooking class, so it's 1.5 hours.
5. Friday: Errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 3 hours
- Wednesday: 0.5 hours
- Thursday: 1.5 hours
- Friday: 2 hours

Adding these together:
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours

So, all Peyton’s after-work activities will take \boxed{7.5} hours."
"April needs 30 plant pots for daisies and twice as many for roses, so she needs 60 plant pots for roses. In total, she needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.

April already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

So, April has 10 plant pots left over. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without the original answer.

Andrea started with $36. She spent some money on a sweater that cost $11 and gave $4 to her brother. So, she spent a total of $11 + $4 = $15.

If we take away the $15 she spent from the $36 she had at the start, we get:
\[ 36 - 15 = 21 \]

So, Andrea saved $21.

The final answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming. So, he swims for 6 / 2 = 3 hours. He also watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he watches 3 * 2 = 6 hours of shows.

Adding all these up, he spends 6 (boating) + 3 (swimming) + 6 (watching shows) = 15 hours on these activities.

We know that 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent. To find the total time, we divide 15 by 0.30:
\[ 15 / 0.30 = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know that 40% of his total time is spent sightseeing. So, we calculate 40% of 50 hours:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing. The answer is 20 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Annabelle needs $400 for a new phone. She already has $80 saved up. She works at her first job for 20 hours and gets paid $10 for each hour. So, she earns:
\[ 20 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

At her second job, she works for 15 hours and gets paid $5 for each hour. So, she earns:
\[ 15 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money she has:
\[ 80 \text{ dollars} + 200 \text{ dollars} + 75 \text{ dollars} = 355 \text{ dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more she needs, we subtract the money she has from the cost of the phone:
\[ 400 \text{ dollars} - 355 \text{ dollars} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Annabelle still needs $45 to buy the phone. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm in primary school.

1. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall.
3. Now, we need to find the tallest tree. The problem says the tallest tree is twice the height of the shortest and the second tree combined.
4. The shortest and the second tree together are 6 + 11 = 17 feet tall.
5. So, the tallest tree is 2 times 17 feet, which is 2 * 17 = 34 feet.

Therefore, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

The final answer is 34 feet."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Dean's mom gave him $28 to buy toys. He bought 6 toy cars, and each car costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]
Dean also bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \]
Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \]
So, Dean spent $17 on toys. Dean's mom gave him $28, so after spending $17, he has:
\[ 28 - 17 = 11 \]
Then, Dean's mom gave him an extra $10. So, he now has:
\[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]
Therefore, the amount of money Dean has left is $21.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Morgan's dad said she has $90 for her birthday party. She wants to play mini-golf once, get $5 worth of arcade tokens, and go on the go-karts twice. Each round of mini-golf costs $5, and the go-karts cost $10 for two rides. So, the cost for mini-golf and go-karts is $5 + $10 = $15. After spending $15, she has $90 - $15 = $75 left. With $75 left, she can buy go-karts rides for her friends. Since each go-kart ride costs $10, she can buy $75 ÷ $10 = 7.5 go-karts rides. Since she can't buy half a ride, she can buy 7 go-karts rides. So, she can invite 7 friends. The answer is 7."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Marisa gets $5 every day from her parents. She spends $1 on lollipops because 4 lollipops at 25 cents each is $1.

So, every day she saves $5 - $1 = $4.

If she saves $4 every day for 5 days, then she saves $4 × 5 = $20.

So, the amount of money she puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is $20.

"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm in primary school.

Billy starts with $10. He spends money on candy that costs $1.50 per pound. He buys 40 gumballs that cost 5 cents each. After buying the candy, he spends half of his change on gumballs.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spends on gumballs. He buys 40 gumballs at 5 cents each, so:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
This means he spends 2 dollars on gumballs, which is half of his change. So, his change is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Billy started with $10 and spent 4 dollars on gumballs, so he has:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]
This $6 is what he spent on candy. Since candy costs $1.50 per pound, we can find out how many pounds of candy he bought by dividing the money he spent on candy by the cost per pound:
\[ 6 \div 1.5 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Carver is 45 years old. The problem says that Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, if we let the son's age be \( x \), we can write the equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The correct answer is: 25 years."
"To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one day and then see how many days it takes to travel 18,000 miles.

First, let's find the total distance for one complete trip:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 125 miles (because it's 50 miles less than 175 miles)

So, the total distance for one complete trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days}\]

Since \(\frac{1}{20}\) of a day is 12 hours, the train goes between services every 12 hours.

So, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To find out how much stuffing Mark needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know:
- A Rottweiler bed needs 8 pounds of stuffing.
- A Chihuahua bed needs 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A Collie bed needs the average of what a Rottweiler and a Chihuahua bed need.

To find the average stuffing for a Collie bed:
\[ \text{Average stuffing} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find out how much stuffing is needed for 4 Chihuahua beds:
\[ 4 \text{ Chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per bed} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we find out how much stuffing is needed for 3 Collie beds:
\[ 3 \text{ Collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per bed} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the Chihuahua beds and the Collie beds:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{23} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the trip.

First, John drives to his friend's house, which is 200 miles away. He drives at 70 mph. To find out how long it takes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to get to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Then, he takes a detour that adds 10 miles, making the total distance 210 miles. The time for the detour is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{21}{7} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

After getting to his friend's house, he drives home. The home route is 240 miles, and he drives at 80 mph. The time for the home trip is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{24}{8} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the times:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for the trip is \(\frac{62}{7}\) hours. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{\frac{62}{7}}\)."
"To find out how many boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we start by figuring out how many boys there are in total. There are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls were absent, so the number of girls present is:

\[ 43 - 5 = 38 \]

Since the total number of fourth-graders is 96, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 96 - 38 = 58 - 4 = 54 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

\[ 54 \]

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"There are 6 girls in the park. If there are twice as many boys as girls, then there are \(2 \times 6 = 12\) boys. So, the total number of kids in the park is \(6 + 12 = 18\).

The total number of kids in the park is 18. 

The options are:
A) 10
B) 12
C) 14
D) 18
So, the correct answer is D) 18."
"To find out the minimum number of points Jane needs on her third test, we first add the points she scored on her first two tests. She scored 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. So, we add these points together:

\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find out how many more points she needs, we subtract the points she already has from the total points required:

\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

So, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. The minimum number of points she must score on the third test is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks. So, we have 3 customers.

Next, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of those who didn't wear masks minus 5. So, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

Then, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is three times the number of those who shoplifted:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we add up all the customers kicked out:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]
This means 31 customers were kicked out for these reasons.

Since a total of 50 people were kicked out, we find out how many were kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the 31 from 50:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 19. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sara scored 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. So, we calculate three times Sara's points:
   \[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]
   This means Erin has 24 points after scoring 14 more.
3. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from the 24 points she has now:
   \[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find out how much will be spent on the senior gifts, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20%, so the total cost per frame is $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198."
"To find out how much Ethan would pay if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we start with the original cost of $400. Since the DIY option saves him 20% of that cost, we first calculate how much 20% of $400 is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$400 = 0.20 \times 400 = \$80 \]

So, Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. To find the total cost for Ethan, we subtract the savings from the original cost:

\[ \$400 - \$80 = \$320 \]

Therefore, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of pairs they sold on Friday. So, they sold:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On Sunday, they sold half the number of pairs they sold on Saturday. So, they sold:
\[ 28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold over the three days:
\[ 14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 14 \text{ (Sunday)} = 56 \text{ pairs} \]

But some people returned their shoes, so we need to subtract the 6 pairs that were returned:
\[ 56 - 6 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50 pairs. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"To find out how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, let's add up the hours for each day she had practice.

- On Tuesdays, she had 1 hour of practice.
- On Thursdays, she had 2 hours of practice.
- On Saturdays, her practice was twice as long as on Tuesdays, so that's 2 times 1 hour, which is 2 hours.

Now, let's add these up:
1 hour (Tuesday) + 2 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Saturday) = 5 hours

So, Hallie had dance practice for a total of 5 hours a week. The correct answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

The company bought $400,000 worth of equipment. Out of this, 40% of the equipment was faulty. We need to find out how much they spent on the good equipment.

First, let's find out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. If 40% were faulty, then 60% were good because 100% - 40% = 60%.

Now, we need to find out what 60% of $400,000 is. To do this, we can calculate it like this:

1. Find 10% of $400,000. This is easy because 10% is the same as dividing by 10. So, $400,000 ÷ 10 = $40,000.
2. Since 60% is 6 times 10%, we multiply $40,000 by 6. So, $40,000 × 6 = $240,000.

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The final answer is: **$240,000**."
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, give her 1 kg of milk each day. The other half, also 15 sheep, give her 2 kg of milk each day.

So, the total milk she gets each day is:
15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg
15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg

Now, add these amounts together:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

Therefore, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day. The correct answer is 45 kg."
"Mrs. Sherman made 12 bread rolls for breakfast. She gave each of her 6 children 1 bread roll, so she gave away 6 bread rolls. That leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 bread rolls. Each of the remaining bread rolls was broken into 8 pieces. So, she broke 6 bread rolls into 8 pieces each, which means she had 6 × 8 = 48 pieces of bread for the chickens. 

The number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is 48. 

So, the answer is 48."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way:

1. We have 40 pupils in total.
2. Half of them like blue, so that's 40 divided by 2, which is 20 pupils.
3. Now we have 40 minus 20, which is 20 pupils left.
4. One-fourth of these remaining 20 pupils like green, so that's 20 divided by 4, which is 5 pupils.
5. The rest of the pupils like yellow. So, we take the 20 pupils left and subtract the 5 who like green, which gives us 20 minus 5, equaling 15 pupils.

So, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Lucy sold all her apples and got $56. Since each apple costs $4, we can find out how many apples she sold by dividing $56 by $4. 

\[ \text{Apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, so:

\[ \text{Apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out how many apples she picked in total over the three days, we add the apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:

\[ \text{Total apples} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50. 

The correct answer is 50."
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which is 10 times 2, so that's 20 socks. She also washed 15 loose socks. So, in total, she washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks. If she started with 50 socks and washed 35, then she missed 50 - 35 = 15 socks. So, the number of socks Lindsay missed is 15. The answer is 15."
"Rachel originally had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies. So, Rachel had:

\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]

cookies in total. Then her brother ate 44 of those cookies. To find out how many cookies are left, we subtract:

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

So, Rachel has 21 cookies left. The answer is 21."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay each month, we first need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest.

The interest rate is 10%, so for five months, the interest is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 5 = 1825 \]

So, the total amount she will owe is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 1825 = 5475 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay each month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5475}{5} = 1095 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1095 each month.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{1095} \]"
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we first need to calculate the distance each person hiked.

Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. So, the distance Cho hiked is:
\[ 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. So, the distance Chloe hiked is:
\[ 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:
\[ 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. The answer is 67 kilometers."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's add up all the silver pesos they have together:
\[50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos}\]

And let's add up all the gold pesos they have together:
\[80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos}\]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is:
\[150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos}\]

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"To find out how much profit Millie makes per hour, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Millie spends $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she can make:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ cups} \]

She sells each cup for $1, so if she sells all 36 cups, she makes:
\[ 36 \times 1 = \$36 \]

Now, she spends $18 to make the lemonade, so her profit is:
\[ 36 - 18 = \$18 \]

She sells all the lemonade in 9 hours because she sells 4 cups per hour:
\[ 36 \div 4 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours:
\[ 18 \div 9 = \$2 \text{ per hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, so he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares.

To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 1 whole (or 5/5) of his land would be.

If 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares, then 1 whole (5/5) of his land would be:
\[ 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The choir has 52 members, and half of them are girls. So, the number of girls is:
   \[
   \frac{52}{2} = 26
   \]
   So, there are 26 girls in the choir.

2. The choir decides to perform only with the girls. So, they will perform with 26 girls.

3. On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, the number of girls who can't make it is:
   \[
   \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]
   This means 13 girls can't perform.

4. Therefore, the number of girls who can perform is:
   \[
   26 - 13 = 13
   \]

5. The choir also has 3 teachers who decide to join them. So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:
   \[
   13 + 3 = 16
   \]

So, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 16. The correct answer is 16."
"To find Wilson's math grade, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests he took. His scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, let's add these scores together:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Adding them step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Now, we divide the total sum by the number of tests, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{80} \]"
"To find out how much 6 erasers and 8 pencils cost, we first calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately.

The cost of one eraser is $2, so for 6 erasers, it's:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

The cost of one pencil is $3, so for 8 pencils, it's:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36. The correct answer is 36."

James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. For Mr. Yu, he delivers one-third as many messages as Ms. Thompson. So, we need to find out one-third of 66.

To find one-third of 66, we divide 66 by 3:
\[ 66 \div 3 = 22 \]

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

Now, to find the total number of messages James delivers, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for David and Dasha to ride all 9 rides.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30. This ride bracelet gives him 9 rides.

Dasha buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. So, each ride costs $2 * 2 = $4. For 9 rides, she needs 9 * $4 = $36.

Now, we need to find out how much money David saves. Dasha spends $36 and David spends $30. So, David saves $36 - $30 = $6.

Therefore, David saves $6. The answer is $6."
"Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. So, she has a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts. She has 144 inches of ribbon to wrap all these gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we divide the total inches of ribbon by the total number of gifts. So, 144 inches ÷ 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift. 

Therefore, the number of inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow is 12 inches. 

The answer is: 12 inches."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

First, we need to find out how many parts the total number of popsicles is divided into. The ratio 5:6 means there are 5 + 6 = 11 parts in total.

Now, we can find out how many popsicles each part represents:
\[ \text{Each part} = \frac{165}{11} = 15 \]

Since Betty's part is 5, the number of popsicles Betty has is:
\[ \text{Betty's popsicles} = 5 \times 15 = 75 \]

And since Sam's part is 6, the number of popsicles Sam has is:
\[ \text{Sam's popsicles} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract:
\[ \text{Difference} = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Tim used to have a cable package that cost $60 a month. Now he's getting streaming services instead. 

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he gets a 20% discount. 

First, let's find out how much Hulu and Disney Plus cost with the discount:
- Normally, Hulu and Disney Plus cost $10 each, so together they cost $10 + $10 = $20.
- With the 20% discount, he saves $20 * 20% = $4.
- So, with the discount, Hulu and Disney Plus cost $20 - $4 = $16 a month.

Now, let's add the cost of Netflix and the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
- Netflix costs $10.
- Hulu and Disney Plus together cost $16.
- So, the total cost for streaming services is $10 + $16 = $26 a month.

To find out how much money Tim saves, we subtract the total cost of streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
- Cable package cost: $60.
- Streaming services cost: $26.
- So, Tim saves $60 - $26 = $34.

Therefore, the amount of money Tim saves is $34."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. That's the same as 4 times 60 minutes, which is 240 minutes.

She spends half that time recording it, so that's 240 minutes / 2 = 120 minutes.

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, to find out how much time she spent editing as a percentage of her total work time, we add up all the time she spent:
240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes.

To find the percentage of time spent editing, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Then:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing is 20%.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ books} \]

Now, Wendy wants to put 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. First, we find out what double the number of slots is:
\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 more to that:
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy needs to carry 92 books to complete her task. The final answer is:

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Erica made 20 cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of cards, and each box has 15 cards. So, \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards.
3. Adding the cards her dad brought to the cards she made, she has \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards in total.
4. Erica gave out 24 cards to her classmates.
5. She also got 17 cards from her family and friends.
6. To find out how many cards she has now, we need to subtract the cards she gave out and add the cards she got:

   50 - 24 + 17 = 43
   \]

So, Erica now has 43 cards. The final answer is 43."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Jenny has a pizza with 12 slices.

First, she gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. To find out how many slices that is, we do:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. To find out how many slices that is, we do:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, Bill gets 4 slices and Mark gets 3 slices. That's a total of:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices given away and eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is 3. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Mark has $50 and he needs $300 to buy a bike. He earns $10 each day. To find out how many days he needs to work, we subtract what he has from what he needs: 

$300 - $50 = $250

Now, we need to find out how many days he needs to earn $250 if he earns $10 each day. We do this by dividing $250 by $10:

$250 ÷ $10 = 25 days

So, Mark needs to work for 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike. 

The answer is 25 days."
"Nancy saw 90 spiders. She saw 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders, so she saw:

\[ \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

millipedes. The number of stink bugs was twice the number of millipedes minus 12, so:

\[ 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

stink bugs. To find the total number of bugs, we add the spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know Erica is 30 years old.

Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so:
\[ 30 + 5 = 35 \]
So, Beth is 35 years old.

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so:
\[ 35 + 7 = 42 \]
So, Alice is 42 years old.

Now, to find out how much older Alice is than Erica, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age:
\[ 42 - 30 = 12 \]

So, the difference in their ages is 12 years.

The answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, he drinks a total of 16 ounces of milk. If milk has 3 calories per ounce, then the total calories he consumes are:

\[ 16 \text{ ounces} \times 3 \text{ calories/ounce} = 48 \text{ calories} \]

So, the number of calories John consumed is 48. The correct answer is 48."
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, let's break it down step by step:

1. The builder works 6 days a week.
2. There are 4 weeks in a month, so the builder works 6 days/week * 4 weeks/month = 24 days a month.
3. There are 12 months in a year, so the builder works 24 days/month * 12 months/year = 288 days a year.
4. The builder earns $50 every day, so the total earnings for the year are 288 days/year * $50/day = $14400/year.

So, the builder earns $14400 in a year. The correct answer is:

$14400"
"Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, he needs:
- \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cups of flour
- \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups of milk

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so:
- \(12 \div 2 = 6\) bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so:
- \(4 \div 2 = 2\) bottles of milk

To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour:
- \(6 - 2 = 4\)

So, Mark needs to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Mel uses an air conditioner that uses 900 watts of energy each hour. If he uses it for 8 hours a day, we can calculate how much energy he uses in a day.

1. **Energy used per day:**
   - 900 watts/hour × 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.
   - 7200 watts is the same as 7.2 kilowatts (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts).

2. **Energy used after reducing the time:**
   - If he uses it for 3 hours a day, then:
   - 900 watts/hour × 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.
   - 2700 watts is the same as 2.7 kilowatts.

3. **Energy saved per day:**
   - 7.2 kilowatts - 2.7 kilowatts = 4.5 kilowatts saved per day.

4. **Energy saved in 30 days:**
   - 4.5 kilowatts/day × 30 days = 135 kilowatts.

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days. The correct answer is:

**135 kilowatts**"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first add up all the stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\)
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\)

Adding these together gives the total number of stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are 3 zebras in total. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[88 \div 3 = 29.33\]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 29.33.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{29.33}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Tyson wants to make muffaletta sandwiches for a big game. Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and it serves 4 people. There are 20 people going to watch the game, so Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches to serve all 20 people.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Next, we need to know how much meat and cheese Tyson needs. Since each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, for 5 sandwiches, he needs:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

Now, let's look at the cost of the meat and cheese:
- Meat costs $7.00 per pound.
- Cheese costs $3.00 per pound.

To find out how much Tyson spends on meat, we multiply the number of pounds of meat by the cost per pound:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Tyson spends on cheese, we multiply the number of pounds of cheese by the cost per pound:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find out the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tyson will spend $50 on the meat and cheese. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm in primary school.

1. Allan starts with 40 cannolis.
2. He buys 60 more cannolis, so he now has:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]
3. The number of corns is twice the number of cannolis he has now. So, he has:
   \[
   2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ corns}
   \]
4. But then he buys 40 fewer corns, so he now has:
   \[
   200 - 40 = 160 \text{ corns}
   \]
5. To find the total number of corns and cannolis, we add them together:
   \[
   100 \text{ cannolis} + 160 \text{ corns} = 260
   \]

So, the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has is 260. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He walked half of his steps on his way to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. Then he walked 1,000 more steps with his friend. So far, he has walked 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. This means he took 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

So, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is 2,000. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{2000}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Toby's book has 45 pages, and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads 300 words in one minute. So, to read 9000 words, it will take him:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to leave the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to finish reading the book 50 minutes before he needs to leave the airport. Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

In May, the company hired 40 employees and each worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks. So, each employee worked:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 40 employees, the total hours worked in May is:
\[ 160 \text{ hours/employee} \times 40 \text{ employees} = 6400 \text{ hours} \]

Each employee was paid $15 per hour, so the total amount paid in May is:
\[ 6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, the number of employees whose contracts expired is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ employees} \]

This means there are:
\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ employees} \]
working in June. Each of these employees worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks, so the total hours worked by these 30 employees in June is:
\[ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} \times 30 \text{ employees} = 4800 \text{ hours} \]

Each employee was still paid $15 per hour, so the total amount paid in June is:
\[ 4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total amount paid in both months, we add the amounts from May and June:
\[ 96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[ \boxed{168000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. She bought 2 pounds of taffy. The taffy is on sale where you pay $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound. So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. So, the cost for the seashells and magnets is:
\[ 1.50 + 4 \times 0.25 = 1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 \text{ (taffy)} + 1.50 \text{ (seashells)} + 1.00 \text{ (magnets)} = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10, so the money she has left is:
\[ 10.00 - 7.00 = 3.00 \]

So, Sally has $3.00 left. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{3.00}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Tim buys two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400 and the second pack costs twice as much, so it costs $800. Adding these together, the total cost of the fireworks is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

So, the discount amount is $240. We subtract this from the total cost of the fireworks:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, Tim buys a finale firework that costs $150. To find the total amount he spent, we add the discounted cost of the fireworks to the cost of the finale firework:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is $1110. 

The final answer is: **$1110**"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies each night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Her recipe makes 12 cookies at a time. To find out how many times she needs to make 12 cookies to get 60 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a batch:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/batch}} = 5 \text{ batches} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 batches of cookies to last her for 30 days. The answer is 5 dozens.

**Final Answer:** 5 dozens"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Marcy makes 50,000 candles in total.
2. 95% of these candles are safe and won't explode. So, 5% are dangerous.
3. 5% of 50,000 is 2,500 dangerous candles.
4. Out of these 2,500 dangerous candles, 1% are guaranteed to explode.
5. 1% of 2,500 is 25.

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25.

The answer is: **25**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The regular price of each blouse is $20.
2. There's a 30% discount, so we need to find out how much 30% of $20 is. To do this, we calculate:
   \[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]
   So, the discount amount is $6.
3. Now, we subtract the discount from the regular price to get the sale price:
   \[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]
   So, each blouse costs $14 after the discount.
4. Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we multiply the sale price by 4:
   \[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Joanne gathers apples from three types of trees:
- From the tallest trees, she gathers 30 apples.
- From the shortest trees, she gathers half of what she gets from the tallest trees, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
- From the average trees, we don't know how many yet, so let's call that number \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

Her sister gathers:
- From the tallest trees, she gathers twice as many as Joanne, so that's 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
- From the shortest trees, she gathers three times as many as Joanne, so that's 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
- From the average trees, she gathers 0 apples.

The total number of apples they gather together is 500. So, we can write the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Now, let's add up the apples Joanne and her sister gather from the tallest and shortest trees:
\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150 \]

So, the equation simplifies to:
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

To find \( A_{\text{avg}} \), we subtract 150 from both sides:
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"To solve this, let's think about it step by step.

We know there are 180 heads and 304 humps. Camels have 2 heads and 2 humps, while dromedaries have 1 head and 1 hump.

First, let's find out how many heads the camels and dromedaries together have. If all were dromedaries, they would have 180 heads (since each has 1 head). But we have 180 heads in total, so the difference must be the number of camels. 

\[ 180 - 180 = 0 \text{ (This is not correct, let's try another way)} \]

Let's use the humps to figure it out. If all were camels, they would have 360 humps (since each has 2 humps). But we have 304 humps in total, so the difference must be the number of dromedaries.

\[ 304 - 180 = 124 \text{ (This is the number of humps the camels have more than dromedaries)} \]

Since each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump, the difference of 124 humps means there are 124 camels (because each camel has 1 more hump than a dromedary).

Now, we know there are 124 camels. To find out how many dromedaries there are, we subtract the number of camels from the total number of animals (which is the same as the total number of heads):

\[ 180 - 124 = 56 \]

So, there are 56 dromedaries. The answer is 56."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Tom went on a trip that lasted for 14 days. Here's how he traveled:

- For the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers each day. So, he traveled \(200 \times 4 = 800\) kilometers.
- For the next 2 days, he traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, he traveled \(800 \times 0.30 = 240\) kilometers.
- On the next day, he didn't travel at all.
- For the last 7 days, he traveled 300 kilometers each day. So, he traveled \(300 \times 7 = 2100\) kilometers.

Now, let's add all the kilometers he traveled:
\[800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140\]

So, the total distance Tom traveled is 3140 kilometers. The answer is \(\boxed{3140}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can find out how big Zack's locker is by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. So:

\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \] cubic inches. This means Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

Now, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, to find out how big Timothy's locker is, we need to double Zack's locker size:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \] cubic inches.

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb, we need to know the difference in their elevations.

Stanley's comb is at 10,000 feet.
Oliver is at 3,000 feet.

To find out how many feet Oliver needs to climb, we subtract Oliver's elevation from Stanley's comb's elevation:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

So, Oliver needs to climb 7,000 feet to reach Stanley's comb.

The answer is: 7000 feet."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Josue got money from two places. The first place gave him $4000. The second place gave him twice as much as the first place, so that's $8000.

Now, if we add the money he got from both places, we get:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Before he got this money, he already had $5000. So, we add that to the $12000 he got:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and each boat took 5 cats, so 4 boats took 4 times 5 cats, which is 20 cats. That leaves 50 - 20 = 30 cats.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran away. To find out how many cats ran away, we calculate 3/5 of 30, which is 3/5 * 30 = 18 cats.

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 - 18 = 12 cats.

The number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"To find out how much Bill pays for 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break it down into different parts:

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month. So, for 6 months, it's \(6 \times 8 = 48\) dollars.
2. For the next 2 months, the cost is $12 per month. So, for 2 months, it's \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
3. For the next 10 months, the cost is $14 per month. So, for 10 months, it's \(10 \times 14 = 140\) dollars.

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[48 + 24 + 140 = 212\]

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $212. The correct answer is \(\boxed{212}\)."
"Let's break it down step by step.

Cole bought two pairs of jeans: tattered and jogger. The tattered jeans cost $28. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so the jogger jeans cost $22.

Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. So, he saved $2 from the jogger jeans and $4 from the tattered jeans.

The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $22. To find out how much more the tattered jeans cost than the jogger jeans, we subtract the cost of the jogger jeans from the cost of the tattered jeans:

\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \]

So, the tattered jeans cost $6 more than the jogger jeans. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to add up the capacity of all the vehicles.

First, let's look at the buses:
- There are 4 buses.
- Each bus can hold 60 employees.
- So, the total capacity for buses is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees.

Next, let's look at the minibusses:
- There are 6 minibusses.
- Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- So, the total capacity for minibusses is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees.

Then, let's look at the minivans:
- There are 10 minivans.
- Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- So, the total capacity for minivans is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
- Capacity of buses: 240 employees
- Capacity of minibusses: 180 employees
- Capacity of minivans: 150 employees

Adding these together: \(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\) employees.

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570."
"Lillian has 3 bird feeders she made and 3 she bought from the store. The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each day. The feeders she made attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so they attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of birds she can expect each day:
- The 3 store-bought feeders attract 3 * 20 = 60 birds.
- The 3 feeders she made attract 3 * 30 = 90 birds.

So, the total number of birds she can expect each day is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the soup and cake first.

1. The bagel costs $4.
2. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find out how much more, we calculate 25% of $4:
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   So, the soup costs $1 more than the bagel, which makes the soup:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. The cake costs half the price of the bagel, so:
   \[
   \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, to find out the total cost of the dinner, we add the cost of the bagel, the soup, and the cake:
\[
4 + 5 + 2 = 11
\]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kenny wants to buy a ticket to the amusement park, and the ticket costs $100. He has $50 left after buying the ticket, so he must have had $100 (ticket cost) + $50 (spending cash) = $150 from selling his Pokemon cards.

Each card he sells for $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total money he got by the price of each card:
\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \]

So, Kenny started with 100 cards.

The number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

The caterer was told to prepare for 36 guests, but he prepared enough for half of them to have two hotdogs. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests would have had two hotdogs each. That means 18 x 2 = 36 hotdogs were prepared.

But 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog. Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, 4 hotdogs were left over. This means 4 guests didn't get a second hotdog.

So, the number of guests who didn't get a second hotdog is 4.

The answer is: **4**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Now, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. First, we need to find half of the letters in Indras' name:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

So, her sister's name has 4 more letters than 3, which means:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Now, we add the letters in both names together:

\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13. 

The correct answer is \boxed{13}."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a simpler understanding.

First, we add up all the items Charlotte wants to buy:
- Pot and pans cost $120.00
- Mixing bowls cost $20.00
- 5 utensils at $5.00 each cost $5.00 × 5 = $25.00

So, the total cost before any discount is:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Now, the store gives a discount of 20%. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $165.00:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 165.00 = 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

So, the discount amount is $33.00. To find out how much Charlotte has to pay after the discount, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount Charlotte has to pay is $132.00.

The correct answer is: **$132.00**"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first add up the cost of all the items she wants to buy:

- Skipping rope costs $6
- Board game costs $11
- Playground ball costs $2

So, the total cost is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Now, we add up the money Dora has:

- Money from allowance is $2
- Money from her mother is $16

So, the total money Dora has is $2 + $16 = $18.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:

$19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball. The answer is $1."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons. Prince Arthur killed three quarters of what Prince Thaddeus killed. So, we calculate three quarters of 100:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \]
Prince Arthur killed 75 dragons.

Prince Walter killed twice as many as Prince Arthur, so:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \]
Prince Walter killed 150 dragons.

Prince Bruce killed one-fifth as many as Prince Walter, so:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30 \]
Prince Bruce killed 30 dragons.

So, the number of dragons Prince Bruce killed is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find out how much gas Josey needed, we start by figuring out how much gas is in each container. If 15 gallons of gas are divided equally into 5 containers, each container gets:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed 1/4 of a container, so she needed:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we convert:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. The final answer is:

\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

George spent $5 in total. He had 1% left, so he spent $4.95 on chips. Each bag of chips costs $0.40, so he bought 12 bags of chips because $4.80 (12 bags) is close to $4.95.

Now, he had $0.05 left, so he spent $0.20 on candy bars. Each candy bar costs $0.75, so he could only buy 0 candy bars with $0.20 because even 1 candy bar would cost more than $0.75.

But we know he bought 3 bags of chips, so let's check again:

- 3 bags of chips cost $1.20.
- So, he had $5 - $1.20 = $3.80 left.
- With $3.80, he could buy 5 candy bars because 5 * $0.75 = $3.75, and he had a little extra.

So, the number of candy bars George bought is 5."
"Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 for himself, so he shared the rest with his friends. To find out how many he shared, we subtract the 5 he kept from the 25 he had:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Now, Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many each friend got, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each friend received 5 lollipops. The answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"Rory made a big cake that was 20 ounces. She cut it into 8 pieces. So each piece is 20 ÷ 8 = 2.5 ounces. Rory and her mom each had one piece, so they ate 2.5 + 2.5 = 5 ounces. That means the cake left over weighs 20 - 5 = 15 ounces. 

So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces. 

The answer is 15 ounces."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. So, together they have:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Now, Sitti and Juris are sharing with 6 of their friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person gets, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ 56 \div 8 = 7 \]

So, each person gets 7 oranges. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he doubles that amount, so he needs 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so for 4 pounds, it costs:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so for 2 boxes, it costs:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock gives:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find out how much each serving costs, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

So, the cost per serving is \$2.00. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

We know Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to be there 4 + 5 = 9 minutes before Wayne.

The problem also tells us that Bernadette's drive takes 4 times as long as Wayne's drive. So, if Wayne's drive is 4 minutes, then Bernadette's drive is 4 times that, which is 4 × 4 = 16 minutes.

To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time Wayne takes from the time Bernadette takes: 16 minutes - 4 minutes = 12 minutes.

So, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The answer is: 12 minutes."
"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to know the width. We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards, which is 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is length times width, so:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 = 9 \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now we know the length is 9 feet and the width is 40 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, let's first calculate how many beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack has 20 beads.

So, the total beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

The final answer is: 80 beads."
"Okay, let's go through the problem again in a simpler way.

When Marcus wakes up, the house is 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees. So, after 3 hours, the temperature goes up by 5 degrees for each hour:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]
So, the temperature becomes:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, in 30 minutes, the house cools down:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 3 \times 2 \text{ degrees} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]
So, the temperature after the window is closed is:
\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees. The correct answer is:
49"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for James' triathlon time.

First, we know Jon's total time for the triathlon is 170 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster, so he takes 10% less time for the swim. Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is:
\[ 40 - (40 \times 0.10) = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James' bike time is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Jon's total time is 170 minutes and he won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

We already know James' swim and bike times, so we can find out how long he took for the run by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time:
\[ 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James took 59 minutes for the run. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is 1.25 times 60, which is 75 minutes.
2. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.
3. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 divided by 4, which is 20 minutes.

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long. The answer is 20 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Michael's horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. First, we need to find out how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we do:

\[ 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, the horse runs 16 miles. For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So, for 16 miles, the horse eats:

\[ 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

A bail of hay costs $3. So, the cost for 8 bails of hay is:

\[ 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars per bail} = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Michael has 6 five-dollar bills, which is:

\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

The change Michael has is 6 dollars. So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs and 2 loose eggs. First, let's find out how many eggs she has in total. Since 1 dozen is 12 eggs, 4 dozen is 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, she has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. So, the number of glasses she can make is 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs/glass = 10 glasses.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold: 10 glasses ÷ 5 glasses/tray = 2 trays.

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog. The answer is 2."
"Okay, let me explain it simply:

Before Joey played, he had 214 points. After scoring 26 more points, his total became:
\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Marcy had 225 points and scored 10 more points, so her total became:
\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, to find out how many more points Joey has than Marcy:
\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points. The answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. So, each sneaker cost him $576 ÷ 48 = $12.

2. He sold 17 sneakers at $20 each. So, the money from these sales is 17 × $20 = $340.

3. The rest of the sneakers sold to the department store are 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers.

4. These 31 sneakers were sold at $25 each. So, the money from these sales is 31 × $25 = $775.

5. Now, we add the money from both sales: $340 + $775 = $1115.

6. The total cost of all the sneakers was $576.

7. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total money made: $1115 - $576 = $539.

So, the salesman's profit is $539."
"To find out how many crayons Beatrice bought, we need to add up the crayons from both types of packets.

First, we have six packets with eight crayons each:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we have four packets with sixteen crayons each:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add the crayons from both types of packets together:
\[ 48 + 64 = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 crayons. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have two choices:
1. A super ticket for $20 that includes a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra.
2. A movie ticket for $12 and then you buy a popcorn and a soda at regular prices.

We know that by buying the super ticket, you save $2. So, if you didn't save any money, the cost would be the same for both choices. Let's figure out the cost of the popcorn and soda separately.

The super ticket costs $20, and it includes a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of the popcorn and soda together is $19 (because $20 - $1 = $19).

Now, if you buy the popcorn and soda separately, the cost is $12 (movie ticket) + $19 (popcorn and soda) = $31.

But we know you saved $2 by buying the super ticket, so the cost of the popcorn and soda together should be $31 - $2 = $29.

Since the popcorn and soda together cost $29 and the soda costs $3, we can find out the cost of the popcorn by subtracting the soda cost from the total cost of the popcorn and soda.

So, the cost of the popcorn is $29 - $3 = $26.

But we need to find the regular price of the popcorn, and we know the popcorn and soda together cost $29. So, the regular price of the popcorn is $26.

The regular price of the popcorn is $26.

The correct answer is: **$26**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. First, we need to find out how much it costs to fill one balloon. We know that 20 balloons cost $900, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. After two days, the price of filling each balloon went up by $20. So, the new price for one balloon is:
   \[
   45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the new price by the number of balloons:
   \[
   170 \times 65 = 10,850 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is $10,850. 

The correct answer is: **$10,850**"
"To find the average speed, we first need to know the total distance the car traveled and the total time it took.

The car drove 60 miles per hour for 2 hours, so the distance for that part is:
\[ 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \]

Then, the car drove 30 miles per hour for 1 hour, so the distance for that part is:
\[ 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives the total distance:
\[ 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

The total time taken is:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

So, the car's average speed is 50 mph. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Each sapphire is worth $800, and each ruby is worth $1200.

First, let's find out how many sapphires Jenna has left after trading:
- She started with 8 sapphires.
- She traded 3 sapphires.
- So, she has \(8 - 3 = 5\) sapphires left.

Now, let's calculate the value of the sapphires she has left:
- Each sapphire is worth $800.
- So, 5 sapphires are worth \(5 \times 800 = 4000\) dollars.

Next, let's find out the value of the rubies she got in the trade:
- She traded 3 sapphires for 2 rubies.
- Each sapphire is worth $800, so 3 sapphires are worth \(3 \times 800 = 2400\) dollars.
- Since 2 rubies are worth $1200 each, 2 rubies are worth \(2 \times 1200 = 2400\) dollars.

Now, let's add the value of the sapphires and the rubies to find the total value of all her jewels:
- The value of the sapphires is $4000.
- The value of the rubies is $2400.
- So, the total value is \(4000 + 2400 = 6400\) dollars.

Therefore, the total value of all her jewels is **6400 dollars**."
"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can do the following:

1. First, we know that Marin eats 4 apples a day and Nancy also eats 4 apples a day.
2. So, in one day, together they eat \(4 + 4 = 8\) apples.
3. Now, to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days, we multiply the number of apples they eat in one day by 30:
   \[
   8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ apples}
   \]

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is 240 apples. The correct answer is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"Bob has 10 raised beds, and each bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find out how much potting soil he needs, we first calculate the volume of one raised bed:

\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since he has 10 beds, the total volume of potting soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. So, the number of bags he needs is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

So, the total cost for the potting soil is $1920. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have 15 red cards. The number of green cards is 60% more than the red cards. So, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15 to find out how many green cards there are.

60% of 15 is:
\[ 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

The number of yellow cards is the same as the sum of red and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, to find the total number of cards, we add up all the cards:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards is 78. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is 25 fairies. So, 25 new fairies joined the 50 that were already there.
3. Now, we add the 25 new fairies to the 50 fairies: 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, we subtract 30 from 75: 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

So, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out what percentage of all the puppies have spots, we can follow these steps:

First, let's add up all the puppies. Jennifer has 8 puppies and Brandon has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, let's count how many puppies have spots. Jennifer's 3 puppies have spots and Brandon's 4 puppies have spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find out what percentage of all the puppies have spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and then multiply by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much of each type of feed the farmer buys:
- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes, each 1 pound, so 2 pounds total.
- Carrots: 4 bags, each 12 pounds, so 4 × 12 = 48 pounds total.
- Hay: 42 bales, each 75 pounds, so 42 × 75 = 3150 pounds total.
- Oats: 20 sacks, each 65 pounds, so 20 × 65 = 1300 pounds total.

Now, we add up all these amounts to find the total weight of the feed:
2 (sugar cubes) + 48 (carrots) + 3150 (hay) + 1300 (oats) = 4500 pounds.

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips the farmer needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
4500 ÷ 2250 = 2.

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed. The answer is 2 trips."
"To find out how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate how much she earns in one week:
- She drinks 3 aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth 2 cents. So, she earns \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cents from aluminum cans.
- She drinks 5 plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth 3 cents. So, she earns \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cents from plastic bottles.
- In total, she earns \(6 + 15 = 21\) cents in one week.

Now, to find out how much she earns in four weeks, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
\[21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\]

So, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Frederick has 10 plants.

Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. So, we calculate 60% of 10 plants:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \text{ plants} \]

Adding these to Frederick's plants:
\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ plants} \]

So, Shondra has 9 plants. The final answer is 9."

"Miss Maria has six decks of basketball cards, and each deck has 25 cards. So, she has 6 × 25 = 150 basketball cards. She also has five boxes of baseball cards, and each box has 40 cards. So, she has 5 × 40 = 200 baseball cards. In total, she has 150 + 200 = 350 cards. She keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives away 350 - 50 = 300 cards to her students. If each student gets 10 cards, then the number of students is 300 ÷ 10 = 30 students. So, Miss Maria has 30 students. The answer is 30."
"Let's break it down step by step for Becky and Kelly.

For Becky:
- She bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \(20 \times 0.45 = 9\) dollars.
- She got a $1 discount, so the final cost is \(9 - 1 = 8\) dollars.

For Kelly:
- She bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- So, the total cost before the discount is \(20 \times 0.50 = 10\) dollars.
- She got a 10% discount, which is \(10 \times 0.10 = 1\) dollar.
- So, the final cost is \(10 - 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
- Kelly paid 9 dollars.
- Becky paid 8 dollars.
- So, Kelly paid \(9 - 8 = 1\) dollar more than Becky.

The answer is: 1 dollar."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- 4 pillow cases (because it's twice the number of sheets)
- 8 towels (because it's twice the number of pillow cases)

So, in one room, there are:
- 2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 pieces of laundry

Now, for 80 rooms, we multiply the number of pieces of laundry in one room by 80:
- 15 pieces/room × 80 rooms = 1200 pieces of laundry

So, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.
2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes.
3. On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) shoes.
4. On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes.
5. Now, let's add all the shoes he got: \(10 + 30 + 60 = 100\) shoes.
6. Adding these to the shoes he already had: \(200 + 100 = 300\) shoes.
7. On Saturday, he loses 180 shoes: \(300 - 180 = 120\) shoes.

So, the number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is 120. The answer is 120."
"Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes per jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Each pan can hold 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans she needs, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes per pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

The pen costs $2. The paper costs $1 less than three times the pen. So, three times the pen is 3 times $2, which is $6. Then we subtract $1 from $6, so the paper costs $5.

Now, the total cost of the pen and the paper is $2 (pen) + $5 (paper) = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the total cost from $10. So, $10 - $7 = $3.

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. **Total pencils at the start:**
   - There are 30 students, and each student has 10 pencils.
   - So, 30 students * 10 pencils = 300 pencils.

2. **Pencils used after two months:**
   - After two months, 1/5 of the pencils were used.
   - 1/5 of 300 pencils = 300 / 5 = 60 pencils were used.

3. **Pencils left after two months:**
   - 300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils were left.

4. **Pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - 1/3 of 240 pencils = 240 / 3 = 80 pencils were left.

So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

The final answer is: **80**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. His dad says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra for cleaning his room. We need to find out how many carrot sticks Matt has to eat to get 5 cookies.

Let's say Matt eats \( x \) carrot sticks. According to the problem, the number of cookies he can have is \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \).

We know that the number of cookies he can have is 5. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

1. Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

2. Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.

The answer is: \(\boxed{6}\)"
"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the shark's length to inches:
   - The shark is 10 feet long.
   - Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the shark's length in inches is \(10 \times 12 = 120\) inches.

2. Calculate the combined length of the remoras:
   - Each remora is 6 inches long.
   - There are 2 remoras, so the total length of the remoras is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) inches.

3. Find the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras' combined length represents:
   - The percentage is calculated by dividing the combined length of the remoras by the shark's length and then multiplying by 100.
   - So, the percentage is \(\frac{12}{120} \times 100 = 10\%\).

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. The answer is 10%."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students don't have a desktop computer.

The problem tells us that 20 students don't have desktop computers. If 20 students represent one-fourth of the total number of students, we can find the total number of students by doing the following:

1. We know that 20 students is one-fourth of the total number of students.
2. To find the total number of students, we need to divide 20 by one-fourth, which is the same as multiplying 20 by 4.

So, we do:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

Therefore, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

The final answer is:

"Jason wants to break in his new shoes in 240 minutes. He plans to walk 4 days a week for 3 weeks. First, we need to find out how many days he will walk in 3 weeks. Since he walks 4 days a week, in 3 weeks he will walk:

\[ 4 \text{ days/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide the total minutes by the number of days he will walk:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day} \]

So, Jason needs to spend 20 minutes walking each day. The answer is:

"To find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we first need to know how many kids are allergic to at least one of the things they're allergic to. 

We know:
- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.

To find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both, we use the formula for the union of two sets:
\[ \text{Allergic to dairy or peanuts} = \text{Allergic to dairy} + \text{Allergic to peanuts} - \text{Allergic to both} \]
\[ = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

So, 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is 20."
"To find out the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees and the number of tour guides.

First, we calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.
- Each group has 200 employees.

So, the total number of employees is:
\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of tour guides:
- There are 3 groups of tour guides.
- Each group has 7 tour guides.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 + 21 = 621 \]

So, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the trip cost.

First, the plane tickets cost $5000 each, and there are two tickets, so:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, the hotel is 20% more expensive than normal. The normal price is $1500 per day, so:
\[ 1500 + (0.20 \times 1500) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]
This is the price for one day at the hotel. For 3 days, it would be:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is $15400."
"Okay, let me explain it simply:

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many blue paint tubes as Ben, so Jasper has \(4 \div 2 = 2\) tubes of blue paint. Jasper also has three times as many yellow paint tubes as Ben, so Jasper has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tubes of yellow paint.

To find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has in total, we add the blue and yellow paint tubes together: \(2 + 9 = 11\).

So, Jasper has 11 tubes of paint in total. The answer is 11."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny.

1. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.
2. The 2010 penny is three-quarters the weight of the 1959 penny. So, we calculate three-quarters of 48 grains:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains}
   \]
3. Now, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny:
   \[
   48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains}
   \]

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains. The correct answer is:

"Keegan and Tashay have earned $83 and $91 together by 3 pm. To find out how much more they need to earn, we add what they have earned and what they need to earn in total.

So, $83 + $91 = $174

They need $200 in total, so we subtract what they have earned from their goal:
$200 - $174 = $26

Therefore, Keegan and Tashay need to earn $26 more to reach their goal. The correct answer is:
\boxed{26}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so Luri has:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ songs} \]

Each player can hold up to 100 songs. So, the number of songs each can add is:
- Gabriel can add: \( 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ songs} \)
- Luri can add: \( 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs} \)

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

James runs 12 miles a day and he does this for 5 days a week. So, the total miles he runs in a week is:
\[ 12 \, \text{miles/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 60 \, \text{miles/week} \]

James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles by his speed:
\[ \frac{60 \, \text{miles}}{10 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 6 \, \text{hours/week} \]

So, James runs for 6 hours a week. The answer is 6 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Uncle Ben has 4 horses, and each horse eats 5 pounds of oats twice a day. So, each horse eats:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, for all 4 horses:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

For 5 days, the total oats needed is:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Each bag of oats has 50 pounds. So, to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs:

"To find the average highest temperature, we first add up the highest temperatures from each place:

- Southlandia: -48 degrees
- Northlandia: 21 degrees
- Midlandia: -3 degrees

Now, let's add these temperatures together:
-48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -29

Next, we divide the total by the number of places, which is 3:
-29 ÷ 3 = -9.67 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the average highest temperature is -9.67 degrees Fahrenheit.

The final answer is:
-9.67"
"To find out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how much more money the child needs to save. The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4. So, the child needs to save $12 - $4 = $8 more.
2. The child promises to save $2 every day. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we divide the amount needed by the amount saved each day: $8 ÷ $2 = 4 days.

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Heather buys 2 packs of razors. Each pack costs $4.00.
2. With the buy one get one free offer, she only pays for 2 razors from the 2 packs.
3. So, she pays $4.00 for 2 razors.
4. She also has a $2.00 coupon, so she subtracts that from $4.00.
5. $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.
6. Now, she has $2.00 to pay for 2 razors.
7. To find out how much each razor costs, we divide $2.00 by 2.
8. $2.00 ÷ 2 = $1.00.
9. Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we know that $1.00 is the same as 100 cents.

So, each individual razor will cost Heather 100 cents. The answer is 100 cents."
"To find the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of all the cheerleaders in the pyramid.

First, we know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall. The pyramid has 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the second layer, 2 on the third layer, and 1 on the top.

Let's add up the heights step by step:

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls):**
   Each of the 4 girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls):**
   Each of the 3 girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls):**
   Each of the 2 girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer (1 girl):**
   The top girl is 60 inches tall.
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we add up all these heights:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert inches to feet, we use the fact that 1 foot is 12 inches:
\[
\frac{636 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Charisma works for 8 hours every day. She gets up and walks for 5 minutes every hour she's at work. We need to find out how many minutes she walks in 5 days.

First, let's see how many times she walks in one day. Since she works for 8 hours and she walks every hour, she walks 8 times a day. Each walk is 5 minutes long.

So, in one day, she walks:
\[ 8 \text{ times/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/time} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes she walks in 5 days. We do this by multiplying the number of minutes she walks in one day by 5:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days, Charisma has walked for a total of 200 minutes. The answer is \(\boxed{200}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Brett is 14 years old now. In four years, he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. The problem says that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, in four years, Angela will be 3 times 14, which is 42 years old.

To find out how old Angela is now, we subtract 4 years from her age in four years. So, Angela's current age is 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

Therefore, the answer is 38 years old."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Paul drives his car twice a day, in the morning and in the afternoon. He does this for 14 days.

Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2.

First, let's find out how many rides he had in total:
- He drives twice a day, so in 14 days, he drives 2 rides/day × 14 days = 28 rides.
- Half of these rides are in the morning, and half are in the afternoon, so he has 28 rides ÷ 2 = 14 morning rides and 14 afternoon rides.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6, so 14 morning rides cost 14 × $6 = $84.

Next, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2, so 14 afternoon rides cost 14 × $2 = $28.

Now, let's add the costs together:
- Total cost = Cost of morning rides + Cost of afternoon rides = $84 + $28 = $112.

So, Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks. The correct answer is $112."

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box. So, Ashley brought:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so Brianne brought:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's add the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne:
\[ 50 + 70 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by 3:

"To find out how many guests are needed for the two venues to be the same cost, let's break it down step by step.

For the first venue:
- There's a flat fee of $200.
- Each guest costs an extra $5 for food.

So, the total cost for the first venue is:
\[ 200 + 5n \]
where \( n \) is the number of guests.

For the second venue:
- Each guest costs $25.
- Food is included in the price, so there's no extra cost for food.

So, the total cost for the second venue is:
\[ 25n \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) where the costs are the same:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20n \]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests needed for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that together they collected 43 insects. Let's say David found \( D \) insects. Then Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects (because she found 7 more than David), and Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects (because David found half of what Bodhi found).

So, the total number of insects they found is:
\[ D + (D + 7) + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Now, let's solve for \( D \):
\[ 4D = 43 - 7 \]
\[ 4D = 36 \]
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Now, we need to find out how many insects Lily found:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects. The answer is 16."
"Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, which is 364 / 4 = 91 yards.
Her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn, which is 364 / 2 = 182 yards.

The answer is 273 yards."
"Cherrie has 5 friends, and 2 of them want 5 gifts each. So, that's 2 friends × 5 gifts = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each. So, that's 3 friends × 2 gifts = 6 gifts. Adding these together, Cherrie buys 10 gifts + 6 gifts = 16 gifts for her friends. Then, she buys 10 more random gifts. So, in total, she buys 16 gifts + 10 gifts = 26 gifts. 

The total number of gifts Cherrie buys is 26. 

So, the answer is 26."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. The chair is 3 feet wide.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug is:
   \[
   3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. First, we find twice the width of the rug:
   \[
   2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Now, we add 2 feet to that:
   \[
   16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the couch is 18 feet long.

The final answer is 18 feet."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. Two of those packs were strawberry gum, and the other two were different flavors. She paid $2 for each pack of grape gum and $1 for the small pack of green apple gum because it was half the price of the grape gum.

So, the total cost for the grape gum and green apple gum is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Since the total cost for all the gum was $7, the cost for the strawberry gum packs must be:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Since there were two packs of strawberry gum, the cost for each pack is:
\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find out how many popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to look at the cost and how many sticks he can get from each type of wood.

First, let's see how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Each 2 x 4 piece gives him 200 sticks. So, from 6 pieces, he gets:

\[
6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Each 2 x 8 piece gives him 400 sticks. So, from 4 pieces, he gets:

\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Since 1600 sticks from 2 x 8 pieces is more than 1200 sticks from 2 x 4 pieces, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 pieces to get the most sticks.

So, the most popsicle sticks he can make is:

\[
\boxed{1600}"
"Mario has 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs. So, he needs 6 pairs of snowshoes. If each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, then the total cost will be:

6 pairs × $12.00 per pair = $72.00

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00.

The correct answer is: **$72.00**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Janet takes 2 bus trips each day, and she does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20. So, the total cost for all her bus trips in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times $2.20/\text{trip} = $22.00 \]

Now, she can buy a weekly bus pass for $20. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the bus pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
\[ $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass.

The correct answer is: **$2.00**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm in primary school.

1. The farm has 30 cows and we need to find out how many sheep it has. The problem tells us the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm. So, the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows.
2. The zoo also has 20 sheep.
3. Now, the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo. So, the farm has \(20 \div 2 = 10\) sheep.
4. To find out the total number of animals on the farm, we add the cows and sheep: \(30 \text{ (cows)} + 10 \text{ (sheep)} = 40 \text{ animals}\).
5. To find out the total number of animals on the zoo, we add the cows and sheep: \(60 \text{ (cows)} + 20 \text{ (sheep)} = 80 \text{ animals}\).
6. To find out the total number of animals on both the farm and the zoo, we add the totals from steps 4 and 5: \(40 + 80 = 120\).

So, the total number of animals on the farm and the zoo combined is 120. The answer is \(\boxed{120}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, which is a total of 16 items.

The problem tells us that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. So, if we divide the total number of items Rose bought by 4, we get the total number of items Sophia bought.

\[ \text{Total items Sophia bought} = \frac{12 + 4}{4} = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \]

So, Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes, which is a total of 4 items.

The answer is: \(\boxed{4}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by his birthday. To lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 3500 calories. So, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
\[ 30 \times 3500 = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Now, Andy has 180 days to reach his goal. To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{180 \text{ days}} = 583.33 \text{ calories/day} \]

So, Andy needs to burn 583.33 calories less each day to reach his goal. The closest answer from the options given would be 583 calories (since we can't burn a fraction of a calorie in this context).

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{583} \]"
"Gerald earns $30 every day and works for 7 days in a week. So, his total earnings are:

\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

He spent $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left. The correct answer is:

110"
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to know the total distance she will run. She is told to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 kilometers. So, we calculate the total distance:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 milliliters of water for each kilometer she runs. So, for 2 kilometers, the total amount of water she needs to drink is:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, Hannah needs to drink 120 milliliters of water. The correct answer is:

120"
"Julie started with $500. She spent 20% on clothes, so she spent:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, she had:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

left. Then she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs, so she spent:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, she had:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

left. 

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is $300. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's say the lot costs \( L \) dollars. Then the house costs \( 3L \) dollars.

So, the total cost is:
\[ L + 3L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

So, the lot costs $30,000. Now, to find the cost of the house:
\[ 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the house costs $90,000.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{90000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each. So, she bought:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack costs $4, so the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

She sold each bag for $8, so the total money she got from selling all the bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much profit she made, we subtract the total cost from the total money she got:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Tara earned is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we need to calculate the total time of the fight and then multiply that by the number of punches he throws per minute.

A fight lasts 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, the total time of the fight is:
\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Joe throws 25 punches every minute. So, in 15 minutes, he throws:
\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

So, the total number of punches Joe threw is 375."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth of what Suzanne made, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
\]

Kelsie made two times more than Josh, so:

\[
\text{Kelsie's cookies} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

So, Kelsie made 18 cookies. The answer is 18."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. First, we need to find out how much money Ali has in total.

- Four $10 bills: \(4 \times 10 = 40\)
- Six $20 bills: \(6 \times 20 = 120\)

So, the total money Ali has is:
\[40 + 120 = 160\]

Next, Ali gives half of this money to his sister. So, he gives:
\[160 \div 2 = 80\]

Now, the money left with Ali is:
\[160 - 80 = 80\]

Ali then uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining money to buy dinner. So, the money used for dinner is:
\[80 \times \frac{3}{5} = 80 \times 0.6 = 48\]

The money left after buying dinner is:
\[80 - 48 = 32\]

So, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[\boxed{32}\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. First, we find out what double the time Rob takes is:
\[ 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add the 40 minutes to this:
\[ 240 + 40 = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house. The answer is:
\[ 280 \]"

First, let's calculate for one grandchild:
- Hats: 2 skeins
- Scarves: 4 skeins
- Sweaters: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Now, add these up for one grandchild:
\[ 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 \text{ skeins} \]

Since she has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the total for one grandchild by 3:
\[ 21 \times 3 = 63 \text{ skeins} \]

So, Martha needs to buy 63 skeins of wool. The answer is 63."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step like I'm explaining it to a primary school student.

Chris has 100 math problems to do. On Monday, he does 12 problems. So, he has:
\[ 100 - 12 = 88 \]
problems left.

On Tuesday, he does 3 times as many as he did on Monday. So, he does:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]
problems on Tuesday. Now, he has:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]
problems left.

On Wednesday, he does one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, he does:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]
problems on Wednesday. Now, he has:
\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]
problems left.

So, the number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39. The answer is:
\[

"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up all the quarts they can pick per hour:
- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

Adding these together: \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\)

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step like I'm explaining it to a primary school student.

1. The bakers baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning.
2. They sold 93 loaves in the morning. So, after the morning sales, they had \(200 - 93 = 107\) loaves left.
3. In the afternoon, they sold 39 more loaves. So, after the afternoon sales, they had \(107 - 39 = 68\) loaves left.
4. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. So, they added these 6 loaves to their count. Now they have \(68 + 6 = 74\) loaves.

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is 74.

The final answer is:

"Jackson has 36 red tulips and can plant 6 red tulips in a row. So, he can plant 36 / 6 = 6 rows of red tulips.

He also has 24 blue tulips and can plant 8 blue tulips in a row. So, he can plant 24 / 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips.

To find out how many rows of flowers he will plant in total, we add the rows of red tulips and blue tulips together. So, 6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of flowers in total.

The total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant is 9."
"Heather has a big bag of raisins with 27 cups. She wants to share them equally among making oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. Each batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins.

To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make, we need to divide the total raisins by the raisins needed for one batch.

First, we divide the total raisins by 3 because she's sharing them equally among three things:
\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we know she has 9 cups of raisins to make oatmeal cookies. Each batch needs 3/4 of a cup, so we divide the 9 cups by 3/4 to find out how many batches she can make:
\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The answer is 12."
"To find out how much more Ada's electric bill will be after adding the new device, we need to calculate the difference in her weekly bill.

First, let's find out how much Ada's bill was before she added the new device:
- She uses 12 kilowatts per hour each day.
- The cost is $1.50 per kilowatt per hour.
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, her daily cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ kW/h} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$18 \]

For a week, her cost is:
\[ \$18 \times 7 = \$126 \]

Now, let's see how much her bill will be after adding the new device:
- The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour each day.
- So, her total daily usage is now:
\[ 12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h} \]

Her new daily cost is:
\[ 14 \text{ kW/h} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$21 \]

For a week, her new cost is:
\[ \$21 \times 7 = \$147 \]

Now, to find the difference in her weekly bill:
\[ \$147 - \$126 = \$21 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. One person can paint half a house in 5 days. So, in one day, one person can paint half of half a house, which is a quarter of a house. That means one person paints \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a house in one day.

2. If one person paints \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a house in one day, then 5 people working together can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4}\) of a house in one day. This means 5 people can paint a whole house in \(\frac{4}{5}\) of a day.

3. Since there are 24 hours in a day, \(\frac{4}{5}\) of a day is \(\frac{4}{5} \times 24 = \frac{96}{5} = 19.2\) hours.

So, it would take 5 people 19.2 hours to paint a whole house. The closest option to 19.2 hours is 19 hours.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{19}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas.
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if we let the number of chairs Ophelia has be \(C_O\), then \(C_O = S_O + 2\). Since \(S_O = 20\), we can find \(C_O\):
   \[
   C_O = 20 + 2 = 22
   \]
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, if \(C_J\) is the number of chairs Jenna has, then \(C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66\).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if \(S_J\) is the number of sofas Jenna has, then \(S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64\).

Now, let's find the total number of sofas and chairs they have together:
- Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs.
- Jenna has 64 sofas and 66 chairs.

Adding these together:
- Total sofas = 20 (Ophelia) + 64 (Jenna) = 84
- Total chairs = 22 (Ophelia) + 66 (Jenna) = 88

So, the total number of sofas and chairs is:
\[
84 + 88 = 172
\]

The total number of sofas and chairs they have is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tom spent $48 in total. He bought a CD for $4, so the rest of the money he spent on the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, if Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $48. Since each CD costs $4, we can find out how many CDs he could buy with $48:
\[ 48 \div 4 = 12 \text{ CDs} \]

Since he could buy 12 CDs with $48, and he could only buy 11 CDs with the money he spent on the headphone set, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
\[ 12 - 11 = 1 \text{ CD} \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he didn't buy the headphone set. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find out the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, let's break it down:

- For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, that's 6 weeks * 4 hours/week = 24 hours.
- For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, that's 2 weeks * 5 hours/week = 10 hours.
- For 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Now, let's add all these up:
24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 40 hours.

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Let's solve this step by step like we're in primary school.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- So, 8 people leave, and we have 48 - 8 = 40 people left.
- Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on the bus. That means 5 times 8, which is 40 people get on.
- So, 40 people get on, and we have 40 + 40 = 80 people on the bus.

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- So, 21 people leave, and we have 80 - 21 = 59 people left.
- Then, 3 times fewer people get on the bus than those who got off. That means 21 divided by 3, which is 7 people get on.
- So, 7 people get on, and we have 59 + 7 = 66 people on the bus.

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is 66.

The final answer is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm in primary school.

1. **Jame's Age:**
   - Jame will be 27 years old in 5 years.
   - So, right now, Jame is \(27 - 5 = 22\) years old.

2. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.
   - His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - So, his cousin will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) years old in 8 years.

3. **Cousin's Current Age:**
   - If his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then his cousin is \(55 - 8 = 47\) years old right now.

4. **Age Difference:**
   - Jame is 22 years old.
   - His cousin is 47 years old.
   - The difference in their ages is \(47 - 22 = 25\) years.

So, the age difference between Jame and his cousin is 25 years. The correct answer is:

\[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. The computer cost $1,100. So, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we know the total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400. If we subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total, we can find out how much the 2 monitors cost together.

So, $2,400 - $1,100 (computer) - $700 (printer) = $600.

Since this $600 is for 2 monitors, we divide $600 by 2 to find the cost of one monitor.

$600 ÷ 2 = $300.

So, one monitor cost $300.

The answer is: **$300**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. There are 20 kids in total, and they are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. So, there are 10 girls and 10 boys.
2. Each boy brought 60 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought by all the boys is:
   \[
   10 \times 60 = 600
   \]
3. Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. So, each girl brought:
   \[
   60 + 4 \times 60 = 60 + 240 = 300
   \]
4. Since there are 10 girls, the total number of seashells brought by all the girls is:
   \[
   10 \times 300 = 3000
   \]

So, each girl brought 300 seashells. The answer is \(\boxed{300}\)."

"To find the total thickness of the four books, let's add up the thickness of each book step by step.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it's 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 × 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, let's add the thicknesses of all four books:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm

Adding these step by step:
31 + 50 = 81
81 + 45 = 126
126 + 62 = 188

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm.

The correct answer is 188 mm."
"Emma can make 72 vlogs in a month. So far, she has made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. That's a total of 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs.

To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the vlogs she has already made from her goal:
72 (total goal) - 54 (vlogs made) = 18 vlogs.

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach her goal. The correct answer is 18."
"To find out how much you ended up paying, we first need to calculate the tip. The dinner bill is $50, and you want to add a 20% tip on top of that.

1. Calculate 20% of $50:
   - 20% is the same as 20 out of 100, which can be written as 0.20.
   - So, we multiply $50 by 0.20:
     \[
     50 \times 0.20 = 10
     \]
   - This means the tip is $10.

2. Now, add the tip to the original bill to get the total amount:
   - The original bill is $50, and the tip is $10.
   - So, the total amount is:
     \[
     50 + 10 = 60
     \]

Therefore, you ended up paying $60.

The correct answer is $60."
"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount of $18 is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy gets $6 because:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11
     \]
   - The following day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21

3. **Spending $8:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8 from his total:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13
     \]

4. **Tripling the Remaining Amount:**
   - After spending $8, he triples the remaining amount:
     \[
     13 \times 3 = 39

"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. April has 30 days, so we need to split the month into two halves, each with 15 days.

In the first half, let's say Elvis saves $x each day. So, for 15 days, he saves \(15x\).

In the second half, he saves twice as much each day, so he saves \(2x\) each day. For 15 days, he saves \(15 \times 2x = 30x\).

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[15x + 30x = 45x\]

We know the total savings for the month is $1125, so:
\[45x = 1125\]

To find \(x\), we divide 1125 by 45:
\[x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25\]

So, in the first half, Elvis saves $25 each day. In the second half, he saves twice as much, which is:
\[2 \times 25 = 50\]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Verna bought apples, oranges, and peaches. Let's add up the cost of each fruit.

For the apples:
- She bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- So, the cost of apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.

For the oranges:
- She bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- So, the cost of oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.

For the peaches:
- She bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- So, the cost of peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, let's add up the total cost:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

So, Verna received $7.00 in change. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, we calculate his total earnings like this:

\[
0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, and she also finished 20 tasks. So, her total earnings are:

\[
0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earned than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[
16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Jairus earned $6 more than Jenny. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Jeff and Brad are sharing 100 dollars. We know that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. Let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars. Then Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

The total money is 100 dollars, so:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide 100 by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Now, to find out how much Jeff gets, we multiply Brad's amount by 4:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"Jeff walks to his work and back home each day. If his work is 3 miles away, he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back, so that's 6 miles each day. If he has to work 5 times a week, he walks 6 miles/day × 5 days/week = 30 miles in a week.

So, the total miles Jeff walks in a week is 30 miles. The answer is 30 miles."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The alphabet has 26 letters.
2. Elise writes the alphabet twice, so that's \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.
3. Then she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so that's 13 letters.
4. Now, she writes everything she has already written. She has written 52 letters twice, which is 104 letters, and then she adds the 13 letters she wrote for half the alphabet. So, that's \(104 + 13 = 117\) letters.
5. She then writes all the letters she has written so far again. So, she writes 117 letters twice, which is \(117 \times 2 = 234\) letters.

Adding all these together, we get \(52 + 13 + 234 = 299\) letters.

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is \(\boxed{299}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 families.
3. In the third round, each of those 9 families calls 3 more families, so that's 9 times 3, which is 27 families.
4. In the fourth round, each of those 27 families calls 3 more families, so that's 27 times 3, which is 81 families.

So, the number of families notified during the fourth round is 81."
"Mark was sick for 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month. So, he lost a total of 10 pounds/month × 3 months = 30 pounds. If his final weight was 70 pounds, then before he got sick, he must have weighed 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds. The answer is 100 pounds."
"To find out how many toys Jonathan has, we need to figure out how many more toys he needs to have a play set that is five times bigger than James's play set.

James's play set has 80 toys. So, a play set five times bigger would have:
\[ 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys} \]

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys. This means if he has \( x \) toys now, then:
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]

To find out how many toys Jonathan has now, we subtract 2 from 400:
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. The answer is \(\boxed{398}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Daniel to buy what he wants:

1. **Notebooks:**
   - He wants 5 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $1.50.
   - So, 5 notebooks cost \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\) dollars.

2. **Pens:**
   - He wants 2 pens.
   - Each pen costs $0.25.
   - So, 2 pens cost \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\) dollars.

3. **Calculator:**
   - He wants 1 calculator.
   - Each calculator costs $12.
   - So, 1 calculator costs $12.

4. **Geometry Set:**
   - He wants 1 geometry set.
   - Each geometry set costs $10.
   - So, 1 geometry set costs $10.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
- Total cost for notebooks: $7.50
- Total cost for pens: $0.50
- Total cost for the calculator: $12
- Total cost for the geometry set: $10

Adding these together: \(7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20\) dollars.

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. So, the discount amount is:
- 10% of $20 = \(0.10 \times 20 = 2\) dollars.

Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
- Total cost after discount: \(20 - 2 = 18\) dollars.

So, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars on all the items he wants to buy."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we calculate the cost of the hamburgers:
\[ 5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$4 \text{ per hamburger} = \$20 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the potato fries:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times \$0.30 \text{ per pack} = \$3 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the fruit drinks:
\[ 5 \text{ cans} \times \$2 \text{ per can} = \$10 \]

Now, we add these costs together to find the total:
\[ \$20 + \$3 + \$10 = \$33 \]

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we subtract the total cost from fifty dollars to find the change:
\[ \$50 - \$33 = \$17 \]

So, the change Carly gets back is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply for Antonella.

Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods. The first $1000 she gets a 30% commission, and the rest gets an extra 10% commission.

First, we calculate the commission for the first $1000:
- 30% of $1000 is $1000 * 0.30 = $300.

Next, we calculate the commission for the rest of the $2500:
- The rest is $2500 - $1000 = $1500.
- 10% of $1500 is $1500 * 0.10 = $150.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total commission:
- $300 + $150 = $450.

So, Antonella earned $450. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{450}
\]"
"Bill started with 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he had:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

He has 70 guests coming, and he wants to give each guest 2 bottles of water. So, he needs:
\[ 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

He already has 48 bottles, so he needs to buy:
\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Time to swim a mile in cold water:**
   - Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

2. **Time to swim a mile in warm water:**
   - In warm water, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water.
   - Twice the time in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
   - So, in warm water, Ray swims a mile in \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

3. **Time to swim 3 miles in cold water:**
   - If it takes 16 minutes to swim 1 mile, then for 3 miles it will take \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes.

4. **Time to swim 3 miles in warm water:**
   - If it takes 34 minutes to swim 1 mile, then for 3 miles it will take \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes.

5. **Difference in time:**
   - Time to swim 3 miles in warm water: 102 minutes.
   - Time to swim 3 miles in cold water: 48 minutes.
   - The difference is \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day. The answer is 54 minutes."
"John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, he earns $2 × 5 = $10 a day. He works 4 days a week, so he earns $10 × 4 = $40 a week.

If he wants to save $80, we need to find out how many weeks it will take him to save that much. We do this by dividing $80 by his weekly earnings of $40.

\[ \frac{80}{40} = 2 \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80. The answer is 2 weeks."
"To find out how much it costs for lunch today at Subway, we need to add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

The foot-long fish sub costs $40. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub, so it costs:
\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, we add the cost of both subs together:
\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160. 

The final answer is: **$160**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm in primary school.

We have a bag with 21 buttons. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each, and the rest have 4 holes each.

First, let's find out how many buttons have 4 holes:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]
So, 14 buttons have 4 holes each.

Now, let's calculate the total holes:
- The 7 buttons with 2 holes each give us:
  \[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ holes} \]
- The 14 buttons with 4 holes each give us:
  \[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \text{ holes} \]

Now, let's add these together to find the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons is 70.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Peter's locker.

First, we know Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches.

Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Therefore, the volume of Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches."
"Let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. So if the daily recommended cups is \( R \), Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups.

The doctor says Juan should drink 4 cups a day. So, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

Now, let's assume the daily recommended cups of coffee \( R \) is 8. Then Juan drinks \( 5 \times 8 = 40 \) cups. The doctor wants him to drink 4 cups, so he needs to reduce his intake by \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) cups.

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To find out how many rodents the pet shop has in total, we need to add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together.

First, we know there are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each. So, the total number of hamsters is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Next, there are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each. So, the total number of guinea pigs is:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Now, to find the total number of rodents, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs:
\[ 30 + 15 = 45 \]

So, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents. The correct answer is 45."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for easier understanding.

Mark weighs 150 pounds.
Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]
Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up their weights:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds. The correct answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. The great pyramids are at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.
2. The sun starts at the top of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground.
3. The sun moves 5 degrees up every hour.
4. If the sun moves for 10 hours, it will move up by \(5 \times 10 = 50\) degrees.
5. So, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be \(32 + 50 = 82\) degrees.

Therefore, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

The correct answer is: **82 degrees**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

James has two sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 8 years old.

James needs one candle for each son, so he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

A pack of 5 candles costs $3. To find out how many packs James needs, we divide the total number of candles by the number of candles in a pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Since each pack costs $3, the total cost is 4 packs × $3/pack = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles. The answer is $12."
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

In the first week, Judy reads for 15 minutes each night. She does this for 7 nights, so:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

So, in 105 minutes, she reads:

\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, she reads 100 pages.

Now, to find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we add the pages from both weeks:

\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 240 pages. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"Okay, let me explain it simply:

Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches to start with. Cody ate a third of them, which is 12 divided by 3, so Cody ate 4 sandwiches. Trevor ate a quarter of them, which is 12 divided by 4, so Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, we need to find out how many sandwiches are left. Cody ate 4 and Trevor ate 3, so together they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches.

To find out how many are left, we subtract the number they ate from the total number they had:
12 - 7 = 5

So, the number of sandwiches left is 5.

The answer is 5."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Shiloh is 44 years old now. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

We are told that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let the nephew's age in 7 years be \( x \), then we have:
\[ 51 = 3x \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{51}{3} = 17 \]

So, in 7 years, the nephew will be 17 years old. To find the nephew's current age, we subtract 7 years from 17:
\[ 17 - 7 = 10 \]

Therefore, the nephew is 10 years old now. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.
2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00 for each tooth. So, for three teeth, that's $1.00 × 3 = $3.00.
3. For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of $1.00, which is $0.50 per tooth. So, for two teeth, that's $0.50 × 2 = $1.00.

Now, let's add all the money together:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

So, the total is $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

We know Richie scored 80 goals. 

1. Anna scored 45 fewer goals than Richie. So, we subtract 45 from 80 to find out how many goals Anna scored:
   \[
   80 - 45 = 35
   \]
   So, Anna scored 35 goals.

2. Mark scored 20 fewer goals than Richie. So, we subtract 20 from 80 to find out how many goals Mark scored:
   \[
   80 - 20 = 60
   \]
   So, Mark scored 60 goals.

Now, to find out how many goals all three scored together, we add the goals of Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[
80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175.

The final answer is 175."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Peter has $70 and he wants to spend the same amount each day for 7 days. So, each day he spends $70 ÷ 7 = $10.

From Sunday to Wednesday, he buys wooden action figures. He spends $10 each day, and each wooden action figure costs $5. So, he can buy $10 ÷ $5 = 2 wooden action figures each day. Over 4 days (Sunday to Wednesday), he buys 2 × 4 = 8 wooden action figures.

For Thursday to Sunday, he buys plastic action figures. He spends $10 each day, and each plastic action figure costs $2. So, he can buy $10 ÷ $2 = 5 plastic action figures each day. Over 4 days (Thursday to Sunday), he buys 5 × 4 = 20 plastic action figures.

Now, to find out how many action figures he has in total, we add the wooden and plastic action figures together: 8 + 20 = 28.

So, by the end of the week, Peter will have 28 action figures. The answer is 28."
"To find out how much the kitten has cost so far, we need to add up all the costs:

- The cost to spay the kitten is $200.
- The cost for 3 vaccines is $20 each, so that's 3 times $20, which is $60.
- The kitten broke 4 vases, and each vase costs $12, so that's 4 times $12, which is $48.

"Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses every week. So, Ford lacks 65 - 40 = 25 roses every week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so Ford lacks 25 * 4 = 100 roses every month.

The number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is 100.

The correct answer is: 100"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account. She takes out $100 every month. We need to find out how much money is left after 2 years.

First, we need to know how many months are in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Katina takes out $100 each month, so in 24 months, she takes out:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she took out from the initial amount:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account. The answer is:

"To find out how much money the food truck makes, we need to know the cost and the money they get from selling the sandwiches.

First, let's see how much bread they need. They need 1 loaf of bread to make 10 sandwiches, and they make 10 sandwiches. So, they need 1 loaf of bread.

The bread costs $3.00 for 1 loaf.

They also spend $30.00 on cheese and other stuff for 10 sandwiches.

If they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, then they get $7.00 * 10 = $70.00 from selling the sandwiches.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of bread: $3.00
- Cost of cheese and other stuff: $30.00
- Total cost: $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

And the money they get from selling:
- Money from selling sandwiches: $70.00

To find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the money they get:
- Net profit: $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

So, the net profit is $37.00. The answer is C."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Kate has 3 boxes of crayons, and each box has 64 crayons. So, the total number of crayons is:
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Each crayon is broken into 8 pieces to make a crayon muffin. So, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 192 \times 8 = 1536 \text{ pieces} \]

Kate can make one muffin with 8 pieces. So, the number of muffins she can make is:
\[ \frac{1536}{8} = 192 \text{ muffins} \]

If she sells each muffin for $1.50, the total money she can make is:
\[ 192 \times 1.50 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total money Kate can make is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Michael's carpet replacement:

1. **Calculate the area of the bedroom:**
   - The bedroom is 18 feet by 12 feet.
   - So, the area is \(18 \times 12 = 216\) square feet.

2. **Cost of the new carpet and padding:**
   - The new carpet costs $12 per square foot and padding costs $2 per square foot.
   - So, the total cost for the new carpet and padding is \(12 + 2 = 14\) dollars per square foot.
   - For 216 square feet, the cost is \(216 \times 14 = 3024\) dollars.

3. **Cost of removing the old carpet:**
   - The old carpet costs $4 per square foot to remove.
   - So, the cost to remove the old carpet is \(216 \times 4 = 864\) dollars.

4. **Cost of installing the new carpet:**
   - The new carpet costs $34 per square foot to install.
   - So, the cost to install the new carpet is \(216 \times 34 = 7344\) dollars.

5. **Total cost:**

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is **11232 dollars**."
"To find out how many birds Mack saw on average each day, we need to add up all the birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up all the birds:
- On days 1 and 2, he saw 50 birds.
- On day 3, he saw 0 birds.
- On days 4 and 5, he saw 120 birds.
- On day 6, he saw 20 birds.
- On day 7, he saw 90 birds.

50 (day 1) + 50 (day 2) + 0 (day 3) + 120 (days 4 and 5) + 20 (day 6) + 90 (day 7) = 280 birds

Next, we need to find out how many days Mack counted the birds. He counted for 7 days.

To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
280 birds ÷ 7 days = 40 birds per day

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds each day. The answer is 40."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm in primary school.

1. Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
   \[
   \text{Starting value} = 20
   \]

2. First, we add half of the starting value to the starting value.
   \[
   \text{Half of the starting value} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Adding half to the starting value} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. Next, we divide the result by 5.
   \[
   \text{Dividing by 5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

4. Then, we multiply the result by the starting value minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Starting value minus 12} = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Multiplying by the result} = 6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

So, the final value of the number train is 48."
"To find out how many cards the boy and his brother have together, we can do the following:

1. The boy has 5 cards.
2. His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so the brother has \(5 - 3 = 2\) cards.
3. To find out how many cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has: \(5 + 2 = 7\).

So, the total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To solve this, we need to find out what temperature Maggie should set her oven to get an actual temperature of 520 degrees, knowing that the oven is off by 4% when set to 450 degrees.

First, let's find out how much the oven is off by in percentage. When the oven is set to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference is 18 degrees, which is 4% of 450 degrees because:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is off by 4% for any temperature setting. Now, we need to find the temperature setting that will give an actual temperature of 520 degrees. If the oven is off by 4%, the actual temperature will be 96% of the setting temperature. So, we set up the equation:

\[ 0.96x = 520 \]

To find \( x \), we divide 520 by 0.96:

\[ x = \frac{520}{0.96} \]

\[ x = 541.67 \]

So, Maggie should set her oven to about 541.67 degrees to get an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

The correct answer is: 541.67"
"To find out how many minutes Max will spend watching the movies, we add the time for each movie together.

First movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1 hour and 30 minutes is 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.

Second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Since 2 hours is 120 minutes, 2 hours and 5 minutes is 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.

Now, we add the time for both movies: 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

So, the total time Max will spend watching the movies is 215 minutes. The answer is 215 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. We know Herb's house is worth $76,000.
2. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's. To find out how much less, we calculate 30% of $76,000:
   - 30% of $76,000 = 0.30 × $76,000 = $22,800.
3. So, Juan's house is worth $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.
4. Now, to find the total value of both houses, we add the value of Herb's house and Juan's house:
   - $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

So, the total value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Judy bought 12 cups and twice as many dishes, so she bought 24 dishes. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than cups, so that's 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the cups and dishes:

- Judy's cups: 12
- Judy's dishes: 24
- Friend's cups: 40
- Friend's dishes: 60

Total cups: 12 + 40 = 52
Total dishes: 24 + 60 = 84

So, the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) is 52 + 84 = 136.

The total number of utensils brought by the two is 136."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each box of contacts costs $100.00, but there's a 10% discount. So, the discount is:
   \[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]
   After the discount, one box costs:
   \[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

2. If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
   \[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

3. Each box has 90 contacts, so 2 boxes have:
   \[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

4. Since Pete uses one pair of contacts per day, 180 contacts will last for:
   \[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ days} \]

5. But we need to find the cost per pair of contacts. Since 180 contacts cost $180.00, the cost per pair is:
   \[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is $2.00. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for easier understanding.

First, we need to find out how many hours Jill worked. She worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. So, the total hours Jill worked is:
2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Now, we need to find out how many hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
2 hours * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday
And John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
1 hour * 3 = 3 hours on Sunday
So, the total hours John worked is:
4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours

Next, we calculate how much money they each earned. They both earn $10 for each hour they work.

So, Jill's earnings are:
3 hours * $10/hour = $30

And John's earnings are:
7 hours * $10/hour = $70

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
$70 - $30 = $40

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The answer is $40."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for easier understanding.

Hannah burns calories while doing aerobics and running. We need to find out how many calories she burns in total and then how much water she needs to drink.

1. **Aerobics:**
   - She does aerobics for 2 hours.
   - She burns 500 calories in 1 hour.
   - So, in 2 hours, she burns \(2 \times 500 = 1000\) calories.

2. **Running:**
   - She runs for 1 hour.
   - She burns 600 calories in 1 hour.
   - So, in 1 hour, she burns 600 calories.

3. **Total calories burned:**
   - Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
   - Total calories burned = 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Now, we need to find out how much water she needs to drink. For every 200 calories, she needs to drink 100 ml of water.

4. **Water needed:**
   - For 1600 calories, she needs \( \frac{1600}{200} \times 100 = 8 \times 100 = 800 \) ml of water.

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

The correct answer is 800 ml."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500. The note says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

First, let's say there are \( B \) blue jelly beans. Then:
- The number of red jelly beans is \( 0.99B \) (1% fewer than blue).
- The number of green jelly beans is \( 1.01B \) (1% more than blue).

So, the total number of jelly beans is:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we know there are 1500 blue jelly beans. Let's find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Red jelly beans: \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Green jelly beans: \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jared's typing speed starts at 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, it goes up to 52 WPM. If he increases it by 5 more words per minute, his speed becomes 57 WPM.

Now, we need to find the average of these three speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

First, we add these speeds together:
\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Next, we divide the total by the number of speeds, which is 3:
\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

The final answer is 52."
"To find out the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate how much weight he would gain or lose in that time.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he loses 1.25 pounds each week. Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss would be:
\[ 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \]

If Martin eats donuts every day, he gains 1.75 pounds each week. Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain would be:
\[ 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the difference in weight between eating donuts and eating Cheerios, we subtract the weight loss from the weight gain:
\[ 8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks is 2.5 pounds. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{2.5} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Alex invites 100 people. Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends. So, that's 100 times 2 friends, which is 200 friends. Then, Alex calls 10 of her friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses. So, we add Alex herself, the 100 people she invited, the 200 friends, the 10 friends she called, and the 8 spouses. 

So, it's 1 (Alex) + 100 (initial invitees) + 200 (friends invited by initial invitees) + 10 (friends Alex called) + 8 (spouses) = 319 people.

Therefore, Alex needs 319 seats. The answer is 319."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm in primary school.

1. The first dog is an Affenpinscher and weighs 10 pounds.
2. The next dog is a Dachshund, which weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. So, the Dachshund weighs \(10 \times 2 = 20\) pounds.
3. The next dog is a Papillon, which weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. So, the Papillon weighs \(20 \div 4 = 5\) pounds.
4. The last dog is a Mastiff, which weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. So, the Mastiff weighs \(5 \times 44 = 220\) pounds.

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs \(\boxed{220}\) pounds."
"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, let's first add up the costs for both places.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, so the total cost is:
\[ 16 + 4 = 20 \]

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so the shipping cost is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]
So, the total cost on eBay is:
\[ 13 + 8 = 21 \]

Now, to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:
\[ 21 - 20 = 1 \]

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, let's look at the height of the beanstalk each day.

- On the first day, the beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- On the second day, it doubles to 4 x 2 = 8 feet.
- On the third day, it doubles again to 8 x 2 = 16 feet.
- On the fourth day, it doubles again to 16 x 2 = 32 feet.

On the fourth day, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than Mark's window that is 20 feet off the ground.

So, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The answer is: **4**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. We need to find out how much protein he gets in a week.

First, let's find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since 100 grams have 3 grams of protein, 200 grams will have twice as much protein. So, we do:

\[ 3 \text{ grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so in one week (7 days), he eats:

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein} \]

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week. The answer is 42 grams."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, if we let Jerry's current age be \( J \), then 5 years ago he was \( J - 5 \) years old. According to the problem, his current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

To find \( J \), we need to get all the \( J \) terms on one side:

\[ J - 2J = -10 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ -J = -10 \]

So, if we multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

This means Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old he will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years. 

The final answer is 13."
"To find out how many hours George needs to work, we first need to know the total cost of the dental work. He needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

One of the implants also needs a crown, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars} \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{260} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle \( x \). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's \( 2x \), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's \( 3x \).

So, we have:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now, we can find the other two angles:
- Twice the smallest angle is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees.
- Three times the smallest angle is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"Colby has 8 quarters, which is 8 * 25 = 200 cents. He also has 6 dimes, which is 6 * 10 = 60 cents. He has 14 nickels, which is 14 * 5 = 70 cents. And he has 15 pennies, which is 15 * 1 = 15 cents.

So, in total, he has 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs he can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball: 345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs.

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs."
"To find out the total number of legs, let's count them one by one.

- Each dog has 4 legs, and there are 5 dogs, so that's 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
- Each cat has 4 legs, and there are 2 cats, so that's 2 * 4 = 8 legs.
- Each bird has 2 legs, and there are 10 birds, so that's 10 * 2 = 20 legs.

Now, let's add them all up: 20 legs from dogs + 8 legs from cats + 20 legs from birds = 48 legs in total.

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases this by 50%, so he adds 50% of 8 pounds to the original 8 pounds. 

50% of 8 is 4 pounds, so he adds 4 pounds to the original 8 pounds to get:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

But it turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds. 

So, he uses:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The weight Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds. 

The correct answer is: 10 pounds."
"Okay, let's count the games year by year in a simple way.

**Year 1:**
- Steve starts with 5 games.
- He buys 1 game each month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
- Total games after Year 1: 5 (initial) + 12 (bought) = 17 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after Year 1 (including Christmas): 17 + 5 = 22 games.

**Year 2:**
- Steve starts with 22 games.
- He buys 2 games each month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games.
- Total games after Year 2: 22 (from Year 1) + 24 (bought) = 46 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after Year 2 (including Christmas): 46 + 5 = 51 games.

**Year 3:**
- Steve starts with 51 games.
- He buys 4 games each month for 12 months, so he buys 48 games.
- Total games after Year 3: 51 (from Year 2) + 48 (bought) = 99 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after Year 3 (including Christmas): 99 + 5 = 104 games.

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games. The final answer is **104 games**."
"To find out how many additional hours it would take to travel 2000 miles at the same speed, we first need to know how fast the plane is traveling. The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so we can calculate the speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time = 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, to find out how long it takes to travel 2000 miles at 400 miles per hour, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

So, it would take 5 more hours to travel 2000 miles. The answer is:

\boxed{5}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for easier understanding.

First, we know Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. So, to find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) as much as Ruiz in one hour. So, we calculate how much Marissa makes in one hour:

\[ 60 \times \frac{3}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Next, we find out how much Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

And how much Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the amounts they both made in 12 hours to get the total:

\[ 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1260 pounds. The correct answer is:

\[

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Howard starts with $100. On Monday, he spends $8. So, he has:
\[ 100 - 8 = 92 \text{ dollars left.} \]

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, which is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars.} \]
So, after Tuesday, he has:
\[ 92 - 16 = 76 \text{ dollars left.} \]

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, which is:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars.} \]
So, after Wednesday, he has:
\[ 76 - 64 = 12 \text{ dollars left.} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Howard has left is:

"To find out how much money Patrick earned, we need to add up the money he made in two different times.

First, for the first 4 hours:
- He sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.

So, for 4 hours, he sold:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]
And the money he earned from these cups is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30.00 \]

Next, for the next 2 hours:
- He sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.

So, for 2 hours, he sold:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]
And the money he earned from these cups is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12.00 \]

Now, we add the money he earned from both periods:

"To find out how many years Jeremy's tires need to be replaced, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that for every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times.
2. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, so we calculate how many rotations the tires make in a month:
   - For 400 miles, the tires rotate \( \frac{400}{2} \times 725 = 200 \times 725 = 145,000 \) times a month.
3. Each tire can rotate 10,440,000 times before it needs to be replaced.
4. To find out how many months it takes for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations, we divide the total rotations by the number of rotations per month:
   - \( \frac{10,440,000}{145,000} = 72 \) months.
5. Since there are 12 months in a year, we divide the number of months by 12 to find out how many years:
   - \( \frac{72}{12} = 6 \) years.

So, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The answer is 6 years."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We know that 2 pumps give 120 washes. So, each pump gives:
   \[
   \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump}
   \]

2. The bottle costs $24.00, and this gives us 120 washes. So, the cost per wash is:
   \[
   \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
   \]

3. Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, 0.20 dollars is:
   \[
   0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents per wash}
   \]

4. Since each pump gives 60 washes, the cost of each pump is:
   \[
   60 \text{ washes per pump} \times 20 \text{ cents per wash} = 1200 \text{ cents}
   \]

So, the cost of each pump is 1200 cents. The answer is \(\boxed{1200}\)."
"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25, and the shorts he picks out cost $35. 

First, we need to find out how much the shirt and shorts cost after the discount. The shirt is $25 and there's a 30% discount, so the discount amount is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the shirt costs:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35, and there's also a 30% discount, so the discount amount for the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
So, the shorts cost:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe has $50 to spend. After buying the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

So, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is $8.00."
"To find out how much butter Juan needs, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know that to make 1 dozen croissants, Juan needs 1/4 pound of butter.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day. So, we need to find out how much butter he needs for 4 dozen.

1. For 1 dozen croissants, he needs 1/4 pound of butter.
2. For 4 dozen croissants, he needs 4 times 1/4 pound of butter.

Let's calculate:
\[ 4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1 \]

So, Juan needs 1 pound of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day.

Now, to find out how much butter he needs for a week (7 days), we multiply the daily amount by 7:
\[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Juan needs 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{7}\)"
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost for each street.

For Monica's street:
- Length: 150 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

So, the cost for Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \times 194 = 29100 \text{ dollars} \]

For Lewis' street:
- Length: 490 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

So, the cost for Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \times 194 = 94860 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs for Lewis' street:
\[ 94860 - 29100 = 65760 \text{ dollars} \]

So, it costs \(\boxed{65760}\) dollars more to repave Lewis' street."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

John got $100,000 for the first 5 months. That's the start of his research.

Now, the research took longer than that. It took 10 times as long as the first 5 months, so that's 10 x 5 = 50 months in total.

The first 5 months were already covered by the $100,000, so the rest of the time is 50 - 5 = 45 months.

For the last 45 months, each month cost 50% more than the first 5 months. The first 5 months cost $20,000 each (because $100,000 / 5 = $20,000). So, for the last 45 months, each month cost $20,000 x 1.5 = $30,000.

Now, to find out how much he spent on the last 45 months, we multiply $30,000 by 45 months: $30,000 x 45 = $1,350,000.

Finally, to get the total cost, we add the $100,000 for the first 5 months to the $1,350,000 for the last 45 months: $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

So, the total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

The correct answer is: **$1,450,000**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate 8 beef tips, and each tip is 1 ounce. So, 8 tips times 1 ounce each equals 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ate vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, we add up the meat they ate:
- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

So, we add these together: \(6 + 8 + 16 = 30\) ounces.

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find out how many posts the group will have in March, we need to do a few simple steps:

1. March has 31 days.
2. Each of the 1000 members posts 3 times a day.
3. So, the total number of posts per day by all members is \(1000 \times 3 = 3000\) posts.
4. To find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March: \(3000 \times 31 = 93000\).

So, the total number of posts in March is 93,000. The correct answer is 93,000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many loads of laundry Gary does in a year. He does laundry twice a week, and there are 52 weeks in a year. So, we multiply 2 loads by 52 weeks:
\[ 2 \times 52 = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Next, we know each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. So, we multiply the number of loads by the gallons of water used per load:
\[ 104 \times 20 = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Now, we know that a gallon of water costs $0.15. To find out the total cost, we multiply the total gallons of water by the cost per gallon:
\[ 2080 \times 0.15 = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{312}
\]"
"Okay, let me break it down simply:

Scarlett bought an aquarium for $10.00.
She bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each, so that's 2 × $2.50 = $5.00.
She got 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each, so that's 3 × $2.00 = $6.00.
She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each, so that's 20 × $0.50 = $10.00.
She also bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add all these up:
$10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00

So, Scarlett spent $33.00 in total."
"Okay, let's think about the beanstalk's growth step by step:

- At the start, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
- After the first week, it doubled in height, so it became \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches tall.
- In the second week, it grew another 3 inches, making it \(6 + 3 = 9\) inches tall.
- In the third week, it grew another 4 inches, so it became \(9 + 4 = 13\) inches tall.

So, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 13 inches tall.

The final answer is: 13 inches."
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to do a few simple calculations.

Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day. So, in one day, he sells:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Bill's bull weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take to sell all the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull's meat by the amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull. The answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. The auditorium has 4 rows of seats, and each row has 18 seats. So, the total number of seats is:
   \[
   4 \times 18 = 72
   \]

2. One-fourth of the seats were taken by administrators. So, the number of seats taken by administrators is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18
   \]

3. After the administrators took their seats, the number of seats left is:
   \[
   72 - 18 = 54
   \]

4. One-third of the remaining seats were taken by parents. So, the number of seats taken by parents is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18
   \]

5. The number of seats left for students is:
   \[
   54 - 18 = 36
   \]

So, the number of students in the auditorium is 36."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. At each intersection, there are 6 poles and each pole has 4 street lights. So, at one intersection, there are:
   \[ 6 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 24 \text{ street lights} \]

2. Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights is:
   \[ 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

3. Out of these, 20 street lights are not working. So, the number of working street lights is:
   \[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-working street lights} = 76 \text{ working street lights} \]

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We have two DVDs. The first one can be played 1000 times before it breaks, and it has already been played 356 times. So, we need to find out how many more times it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 356 = 644 \]
So, the first DVD can be played 644 more times.

The second DVD can also be played 1000 times before it breaks, and it has already been played 135 times. So, we need to find out how many more times it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 135 = 865 \]
So, the second DVD can be played 865 more times.

Now, to find out the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the remaining plays of both DVDs:
\[ 644 + 865 = 1509 \]

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time. So, each week he had 2 x 2 = 4 sessions. Over 6 weeks, he had 6 x 4 = 24 sessions.

Each session was 2 hours long, so in total, he spent 24 x 2 = 48 hours in therapy.

The cost was $125 per hour, so the total cost was 48 x $125 = $6000.

So, the total cost of John's physical therapy was $6000."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jim starts with a 20-pack of gum.
2. He chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school. Since a school day is 8 hours long, he chews:
   \[
   \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{2 \text{ hours/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]
3. He also chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner.
4. So far, he has chewed:
   \[
   4 \text{ pieces} + 1 \text{ piece} + 1 \text{ piece} = 6 \text{ pieces}
   \]
5. After chewing these pieces, he has:
   \[
   20 - 6 = 14 \text{ pieces left}
   \]
6. He gives half of the remaining gum to his sister:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]
7. So, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left is:
   \[
   14 - 7 = 7 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day is \boxed{7}."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years. To find out how old she is now, we subtract 12 from 16:
\[ 16 - 12 = 4 \]
So, Charmaine is currently 4 years old.

Now, we want to know how old she will be 4 years from now. We add 4 to her current age:
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \]
So, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now.

The final answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. So, we calculate:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]
The baseball coach spent $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each. So, we calculate:
\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]
The basketball coach spent $112.

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:
\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{85}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Arianna has a garden with 10 rows of flowers, and each row has 20 flowers. So, the total number of flowers is:
\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers per row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Now, we know that 4 out of every 5 flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we calculate:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find Ashley's internet speed in megabytes per hour, we first need to convert her speed from kilobytes per second to megabytes per second. Since 1 megabyte is 1000 kilobytes, we divide 20 kilobytes by 1000 to get megabytes per second.

\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} \div 1000 = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

Now, to find out how many megabytes she gets in an hour, we multiply this by the number of seconds in an hour, which is 3600.

\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

So, Ashley's internet speed in megabytes per hour is 72 Mb/h. The correct answer is:

"To find out the total number of cars the tow truck pulled, we need to break it down into parts.

First, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, for three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, for the remaining four days, it pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. So, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the four days. Therefore, for four days, it pulled:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we add the cars pulled in the first three days to the cars pulled in the remaining four days:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars the tow truck pulled that week is 54."
"To find out how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to see how much taller he needs to be and then figure out how long it will take him to grow that much.

Adam is currently 40 inches tall. The roller coaster requires 4 feet (which is 48 inches) to ride. So, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Adam grows 2 inches every year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide 8 inches by 2 inches per year:

\[ 8 \text{ inches} \div 2 \text{ inches/year} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster. The answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000. So, the total cost of the cars is:
\[ 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of that price to get the cars, so:
\[ 30\% \times 250,000 = 0.30 \times 250,000 = 75,000 \]

The profit James made is the total cost minus what the company paid:
\[ 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profit, so:
\[ 10\% \times 175,000 = 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500 \]

So, James made:
\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. We know there are 100 surfers in total.
2. When a big wave comes, only 25% of them can stay on the wave. So, we calculate 25% of 100:
   \[
   100 \times 0.25 = 25
   \]
   So, 25 surfers can stay on the wave.

3. Out of these 25 surfers, 60% are women. So, we find 60% of 25:
   \[
   25 \times 0.60 = 15
   \]
   So, 15 of the surfers who can stay on the wave are women.

4. The rest of the surfers who can stay on the wave are men. So, we subtract the number of women from the total number of surfers who can stay on the wave:
   \[
   25 - 15 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 surfers who can stay on the wave are men.

Therefore, the number of men who can stay on the wave is 10."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

We know the price of a diamond jewel is $2000.

1. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel.
   - So, we calculate: \( \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \) dollars.
   - This means the gold jewel costs $1600.

2. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   - So, we calculate: \( 1600 - 400 = 1200 \) dollars.
   - This means the silver jewel costs $1200.

Now, to find the total price for all three jewels, we add their prices together:
- Diamond jewel: $2000
- Gold jewel: $1600
- Silver jewel: $1200

Adding these up: \( 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \) dollars.

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800.

The final answer is: $4800"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought:
\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \text{ truck stamps} \]

He also bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought:
\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \text{ rose stamps} \]

Now, to find out how many stamps he bought in total, we add up all the stamps:
\[ 16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45 \text{ stamps} \]

So, Max bought a total of 45 stamps. The answer is 45."
"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to figure out how fast Tom is closing the gap between them and then see how long it takes for him to close the 75-mile gap.

Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. So, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of \(70 - 55 = 15\) miles per hour.

Bob is 75 miles ahead. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by the speed at which Tom is closing the gap:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so:
   \[
   \text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 = 11
   \]
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so:
   \[

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish. The correct answer is 14."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Manny's parents said if the cost per class is more than $10, they won't sign him up again. He paid a total of $60 for 10 classes. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class goes over $10.

First, let's see how much each class costs if he misses some classes. If he misses 6 classes, he only has to pay for 4 classes. So, the cost per class would be:
\[ \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]
Since $15 is more than $10, they won't sign him up again if he misses 6 or more classes.

Now, let's check if he can miss 5 classes:
\[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]
Since $12 is more than $10, they won't sign him up again if he misses 5 or more classes.

Finally, let's check if he can miss 4 classes:
\[ \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]
Since $10 is not more than $10, they will sign him up again if he misses 4 classes.

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before they don't sign him up again. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. We know Jewel processes 50 customers a day.
2. Julie processes twice as many as Jewel, so she processes \(50 \times 2 = 100\) customers a day.
3. In a week, which has 7 days, Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers.
4. In the same week, Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers.
5. To find the total number of customers they process together in a week, we add Jewel's and Julie's totals: \(350 + 700 = 1050\).

So, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers. The answer is \(\boxed{1050}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Lynn's distance.

Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Reggie ran 3 miles more than Lynn. So, if we let Lynn's distance be \( L \), then:
\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

To find \( L \), we subtract 3 from 20:
\[ L = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

First, we find out how much one apple costs. If 4 apples cost $5.20, then one apple costs:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]
So, one apple costs $1.30.

Next, we find out how much one orange costs. If 3 oranges cost $3.30, then one orange costs:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]
So, one orange costs $1.10.

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples and 5 oranges cost together:
- 5 apples cost \(5 \times 1.30 = 6.50\)
- 5 oranges cost \(5 \times 1.10 = 5.50\)

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\)."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The hole is shaped like a big box, and we can find the volume by multiplying its length, width, and height.

The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. So, we multiply these numbers together:

\[ 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \]

The hole has a volume of 72 cubic feet.

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to dig one cubic foot of earth. So, to find out how long it will take him to dig 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to dig one cubic foot:

\[ 72 \times 3 = 216 \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.

The correct answer is 216 seconds."
"To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we start with the base price of the truck, which is $30,000. Then we add the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500. Next, we calculate the cost of the leather seats, which is one-third of the king cab upgrade. So, the leather seats cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. The running boards cost $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. Finally, the upgraded exterior light package costs $1,500.

Now, we add all these costs together:
- Base price: $30,000
- King cab upgrade: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Adding these up:
\[ 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 = 43,500 \]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Tim's new salary and bonus.

First, Tim gets a 5% raise on his $20,000 salary. To find out how much the raise is, we calculate 5% of $20,000:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 20,000 = \frac{5}{100} \times 20,000 = 1,000 \]
So, his new salary after the raise is:
\[ 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \]

Next, Tim gets a bonus that is half of his new salary:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 21,000 = 10,500 \]

So, his total monthly income after the raise and bonus is:
\[ 21,000 + 10,500 = 31,500 \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:
\[ 31,500 \times 12 = 378,000 \]

So, Tim will make $378,000 in a year. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{378000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, the total cost for the suits is:
\[ 10 \times 750 = 7500 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, he buys 10 pairs of dress pants. Each pair of dress pants costs half the cost of a suit, so:
\[ \frac{750}{2} = 375 \text{ dollars} \]
So, the total cost for the dress pants is:
\[ 10 \times 375 = 3750 \text{ dollars} \]

James also buys 3 dress shirts for each suit. Since he has 10 suits, he buys:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ dress shirts} \]
Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is:
\[ 30 \times 60 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 7500 + 3750 + 1800 = 13050 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \boxed{13050} \]"
"To find out the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know the news website publishes 20 articles every day. Since February has 28 days, we multiply 20 by 28:
   \[
   20 \times 28 = 560
   \]
   So, the news website publishes 560 articles in February.

2. The sister company publishes 10 articles every day. Again, since February has 28 days, we multiply 10 by 28:
   \[
   10 \times 28 = 280
   \]
   So, the sister company publishes 280 articles in February.

3. To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we add the articles from both websites:
   \[
   560 + 280 = 840
   \]

So, the total number of articles published by both websites in February is 840. The correct answer is 840."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is \(60 + 4 = 64\) years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is \(64 \div 2 = 32\) years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is \(32 - 3 = 29\) years old.

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The answer is: **29**"
"To find out how much flour was in three bags before they were divided, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how much flour is in one bag. The problem tells us that one bag is divided into 8 portions, and each portion weighs 2 kilograms. So, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion to find the total weight in one bag:
   \[
   8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms}
   \]
   So, one bag weighs 16 kilograms.

2. Now, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. We do this by multiplying the weight of one bag by 3:
   \[
   16 \text{ kilograms} \times 3 = 48 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags before they were divided is 48 kilograms. The correct answer is 48 kilograms."
"Alisa biked at 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so the distance she biked is:
\[ 12 \times 4.5 = 54 \text{ miles} \]

Stanley biked at 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, so the distance he biked is:
\[ 10 \times 2.5 = 25 \text{ miles} \]

To find the total distance they biked together, we add the distances:
\[ 54 + 25 = 79 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance they biked is 79 miles. The correct answer is 79 miles."
"Bill needs to dig through 24 feet of soil at a rate of 4 feet per hour. So, the time to dig through the soil is 24 feet ÷ 4 feet per hour = 6 hours.

Then, he needs to dig through 8 feet of clay at a rate of 2 feet per hour (half the speed through soil). So, the time to dig through the clay is 8 feet ÷ 2 feet per hour = 4 hours.

Adding the time to dig through the soil and the clay, the total time to dig the well is 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is 10 hours. The correct answer is 10 hours."
"Howie wants to buy cupcakes for everyone in his class, including himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. Each person will get 2 cupcakes, one vanilla and one chocolate.

First, let's find out how many people in total are getting cupcakes. Howie, his teacher, and 25 classmates make a total of:
\[ 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 \text{ people} \]

Since each person gets 2 cupcakes, the total number of cupcakes needed is:
\[ 27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes per person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes} \]

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Fishio's photo got 2000 likes after 1 week. Three weeks later, it got 70 times as many likes as the initial number. So, we calculate 70 times 2000:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means after 3 weeks, the photo had 140,000 likes. Then, she got 20,000 more likes recently. So, we add those 20,000 likes to the 140,000 likes:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the total number of likes now is 160,000.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{160000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for easier understanding.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. So, the total cost was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]
But she got a $2 discount, so the final cost was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

The next day, the price of each pomegranate was $30, but there was a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we calculate the total cost without the discount:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]
Then, we apply the 10% discount:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ariadne sold red hats for $400. This is half the amount she sold green hats for. So, if $400 is half of the green hat sales, then the full amount she sold green hats for is $400 times 2, which is $800.

So, in the first month, she made $400 from red hats and $800 from green hats. That means she made a total of $400 + $800 = $1200 in the first month.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the first month's sales. So, we need to find 3/4 of $1200. To do this, we multiply $1200 by 3/4:

\[ 1200 \times \frac{3}{4} = 1200 \times 0.75 = 900 \]

So, in the second month, she made $900.

Now, to find out how much she made in total over the two months, we add the amounts from both months:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

So, the total amount she made in two months is $2100.

The final answer is $2100."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours in total. But he gets 1 hour for free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour costs $15. The second hour costs twice as much as the first hour, so it's $15 * 2 = $30. The third hour costs twice as much as the second hour, so it's $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, we add up the cost of the three paid hours:
$15 + $30 + $60 = $105

So, James paid $105 for the carriage. The answer is $105."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Sally's bank account started with $200 and now has $420. This means she earned an extra $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Her weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was taken away, we subtract her weekly wage from the extra money she earned: $220 - $300 = -$80.

Since we got a negative number, it means $80 was taken away from her wage. So, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80.

The correct answer is: **$80**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. If each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, and she's inviting 16 guests, we first find out how many deviled egg halves all the guests will eat together.

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Now, since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed for 48 deviled egg halves.

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs 24 whole eggs make.

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen eggs} \]

So, Lori will need 2 dozen eggs. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Shiela needs to write a 15-page research paper. She has already written 1/3 of it. To find out how many pages she has written, we do:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages}
\]

So, she has written 5 pages. To find out how many pages she still needs to write, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total pages:

\[
15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages}
\]

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"Mike's teacher gave him a homework to read a 200-page book. Mike plans to read 10 pages every day. We need to find out how many days it will take him to finish reading the book.

First, we calculate how many days it will take Mike to read the whole book:
- The book has 200 pages.
- Mike reads 10 pages each day.

So, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each day:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Now, we know it will take Mike 20 days to finish reading the book. The homework is due in 30 days. To find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish, we subtract the number of days it takes him to finish from the deadline:
\[ 30 \text{ days} - 20 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the first year.

James buys a plane that costs $150,000. That's a big number, isn't it? 

Now, he has to pay $5,000 each month to rent a place to keep the plane. So, for one year, which has 12 months, he pays:
\[ 5000 \times 12 = 60000 \text{ dollars} \]

He also spends twice as much on fuel each month as he does on renting the place. So, for fuel, he pays:
\[ 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars} \text{ per month} \]

For one year, the fuel cost is:
\[ 10000 \times 12 = 120000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total cost for the first year, we add the cost of the plane and the total costs for renting and fueling:
\[ 150000 + 60000 + 120000 = 330000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the first year is $330,000. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{330000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Finley took 30 minutes to cook rice.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so:
   - Pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.
3. The time to cook beans was half the time it took to cook pork and rice together.
   - First, we find the total time to cook rice and pork:
     - Rice: 30 minutes
     - Pork: 50 minutes
     - Total: 30 + 50 = 80 minutes
   - Beans took half of this time:
     - Beans: 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.
4. Now, we add up the time for all the food:
   - Rice: 30 minutes
   - Pork: 50 minutes
   - Beans: 40 minutes
   - Total: 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.

So, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food. The answer is 120 minutes."
"To find out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the almonds and walnuts in each mixture:

For the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

For the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts):
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more the first mixture costs compared to the second mixture:
- The difference in cost is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

So, the first mixture costs 3 dollars more than the second mixture. The answer is 3 dollars."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know:
- Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
- Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
- The total number of heads is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

First, let's think about the heads. If there are 20 heads, that means there are 20 animals in total (sheep and geese).

Now, let's think about the legs. If all 20 animals were sheep, they would have 20 sheep * 4 legs = 80 legs. But we only have 70 legs, so not all animals are sheep.

Let's assume there are \( S \) sheep and \( G \) geese. We know:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To find \( S \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep \( S \) is 15.

To check, if there are 15 sheep, then there are \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) geese. The total number of legs would be:
\[ 15 \text{ sheep} \times 4 \text{ legs/sheep} + 5 \text{ geese} \times 2 \text{ legs/geese} = 60 + 10 = 70 \text{ legs} \]

This matches the total number of legs given. So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Roger buys coffee and a donut. The normal coffee costs $5 a pound, but since he couldn't get that, he had to buy more expensive coffee that costs 20% more. So, the more expensive coffee costs $5 + (20% of $5) = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound. He needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week because he uses 1 pound a day. So, the coffee costs $6 × 7 = $42. He also buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost is $42 + $2 = $44. The answer is $44."
"Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we need to subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount spent.

First, let's add up the cost of the chips, the chicken, and the soda:
- 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each: \(2 \times 2.00 = 4.00\)
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Adding these together: \(4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00\)

Now, we subtract this total from the $20.00 Gus spent:
- \(20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00\)

So, the apple pie cost $7.00. The correct answer is:

\[7.00\]"
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total newspapers delivered in a day.

The total newspapers delivered in a day is 600.

The newspapers delivered to District A is 198.

The newspapers delivered to District C is 209.

So, we calculate the newspapers delivered to District B as follows:

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - (198 + 209) \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - 407 \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 193 \]

Therefore, the number of newspapers James delivers to District B is 193."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John goes to cooking class 4 times a week. Each class is 2 hours long. He goes for 6 weeks.

First, we need to find out how many hours he spends in class in total. We do this by multiplying the number of classes he takes each week by the number of hours each class is and then by the number of weeks:

\[ 4 \text{ classes/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Now, John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours he spent in class by the number of hours it takes to learn one recipe:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes. The answer is 32."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have 150 teachers on the basketball court. Out of these, 60% are history teachers. To find out how many history teachers there are, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find out how many math teachers there are, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out how many hours all the math teachers sleep in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours. 

The answer is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how much money Kassidy has. We know that Aurelia has $120 and Kassidy has 3/4 of what Aurelia has. So, we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:
   \[
   \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Next, we find out how much Rayna has. Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so:
   \[
   \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Now, we add up all their money to find the total:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. If they share the total money equally, each person gets:
   \[
   \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, each person would get \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"To find out how long the entire game lasted, we need to add up the time for all the quarters.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, and there are 4 quarters in total. So, the time for the first three quarters is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

In the last quarter, the game was extended by 5 minutes because of a tie. So, the last quarter is:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for the first three quarters to the time for the last quarter:
\[ 36 + 17 = 53 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the entire game lasted 53 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{53} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

We have a company with 50 employees. Out of these, 20% are management. To find out how many that is, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Now, out of these 10 management employees, only 30% oversee the entire company. To find out how many that is, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 10 = \frac{30}{100} \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

So, 3 employees oversee the company.

The number of employees who oversee the company is **3**."

- 5 tablespoons of flour
- 3 tablespoons of sugar
- 0.25 tablespoons of salt

So, the total for one muffin is:
\[ 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Now, to find out how much she needs for 16 muffins, we multiply the amount for one muffin by 16:

Adam bought 7 candies of type A, and each costs $0.5. So, the total cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \]

He also bought 10 candies of type B, and each costs $0.75. So, the total cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \]

Now, we add the costs of both types of candies:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change he got, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Christina recorded her moods for 30 days. We know:
- 12 days were good.
- 8 days were bad.
- The rest were neutral.

So, the number of neutral days is:
\[ 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \]

Now, we know:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The last 8 days were neutral.

We also know the next three days:
- Day 29 was good.
- Day 30 was neutral.
- Day 31 was good.

Let's count the good days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days.
- Next 3 days: 1 good day (Day 29) + 1 good day (Day 31) = 2 good days.

So, the total number of good days is:
\[ 8 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 10 \]

Christina had 12 good days in total. So, the number of good days left is:
\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 2.

The correct answer is: **2**"
"Okay, let me explain it simply without the original answer.

We know Janey has 21 books. The problem says Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. So, if we let the number of books Sally has be \( S \), then Janey has \( 2S + 3 \) books.

We know Janey has 21 books, so we can write:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find out how many books Sally has, we need to solve this:
1. Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

2. Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The number of books Sally has is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The bamboo is currently 20 feet tall. We need to convert this to inches because the growth rate is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches every day. We want to know how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches. First, we find out how much more the bamboo needs to grow:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches each day, we divide the total inches needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ 360 \text{ inches} \div 30 \text{ inches/day} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches. The answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so he needs 8 more toys to have one toy per dog. So, he needs 8 toys.
3. After buying the toys, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. When he left, there were 4 dogs, so twice as many more dogs means there are 8 more dogs. So now there are 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 dogs.
4. He needs 1 toy per dog, so he needs 12 toys now.
5. When he came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. Now he has 12 - 3 = 9 dogs.
6. He needs 1 toy per dog, so he needs 9 toys now.

Adding up all the toys he needs:
- Initially, he needed 8 toys.
- After buying the toys, he needed 12 toys.
- When he came back again, he needed 9 toys.

So, the total number of toys he needs is 8 + 12 + 9 = 29 toys.

The total number of toys James needs is 29."

1. The total money they had was $1200.
2. Dylan invested 2/5 of $1200, which is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]
   So, Dylan invested $480.
3. After Dylan's investment, the remaining money is:
   \[
   1200 - 480 = 720
   \]
4. Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining $720, which is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
   \]
   So, Frances invested $480.
5. After Frances's investment, the remaining money is:
   \[
   720 - 480 = 240
   \]
6. The rest of the money, which is $240, was invested by Skyler.

So, Skyler's investment was $240. The answer is \boxed{240}."
"Carol and Jennifer already have 20 signatures from Carol and 44 signatures from Jennifer. So together, they have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures. They want to have 100 signatures in total. To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the signatures they already have from their goal:

100 (their goal) - 64 (signatures they have) = 36 (signatures they need).

So, Carol and Jennifer need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal. The correct answer is 36."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Lorie earns $10 per hour. Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, so Karen earns $10 x 2 = $20 per hour.

Karen works 3 hours a day, so her daily earnings are $20 x 3 = $60.

In two days, Karen earns $60 x 2 = $120.

So, the final answer is $120."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. To find out how many hash browns we can get from 96 potatoes, we first figure out how many hash browns we get from 1 potato.

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then:
\[ \text{Hash browns from 1 potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, if we have 96 potatoes, we can calculate the total number of hash browns:
\[ \text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, the number of hash browns we can make from 96 potatoes is 576."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jack weighs 80 kg.
2. Each of the 8 other adults also weighs 80 kg.
3. So, the total weight of the 8 adults is \(8 \times 80 = 640\) kg.
4. Adding Jack's weight to the adults' weight gives us \(640 + 80 = 720\) kg.
5. The elevator can only hold 700 kg.

To find out how much they will exceed the limit, we subtract the elevator's limit from the total weight:

\[720 - 700 = 20\]

So, they will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. The problem tells us that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, if Katarina has 68 cookies, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Next, we know Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, if Max has 73 cookies, the Cookie Monster must have 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Now, we know Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, if Max has 73 cookies, Summer must have 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find out how many cookies they all have together, we add up the cookies each person has:
68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298 cookies.

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298. The correct answer is 298."
"To find out the original length of the dress, let's break it down step by step.

1. Shania adds 50% of the original length to the dress. This means the dress becomes 150% of its original length.
2. Then she adds 20 cm more to the bottom of the dress.
3. The final length of the dress is 140 cm.

Let's think of it like this:
- If the original length is \( x \), then after adding 50% of \( x \), the length becomes \( x + 0.5x = 1.5x \).
- Then she adds 20 cm more, so the total length is \( 1.5x + 20 \).
- We know this total length is 140 cm.

So, we have the equation:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 1.5x = 140 - 20 \]
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The answer is: 80 cm"
"Chris has a lawn mower that can mow his lawn in two different speeds. In turtle mode, it takes him 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. In rabbit mode, it takes him 40 minutes.

Today, Chris decided to mow half of his lawn in turtle mode and the other half in rabbit mode. So, he mowed half of the lawn in 60 minutes and the other half in 40 minutes.

To find out how long it took him in total, we add the time for each half:
- Time for the first half (in turtle mode) = 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.
- Time for the second half (in rabbit mode) = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we add these times together:
- Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the whole lawn. The correct answer is 50 minutes."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes to get to school. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner with the library and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, the total time they have spent so far is 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes. They have 30 minutes in total, so the time they have left to get to school is 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes. 

Therefore, the answer is 11 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Catherine buys:
- 1 kilo of apples for $4.
- 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo, so that's 2 * $2 = $4.
- 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo, so that's 2 * $3 = $6.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Cost of apples: $4
- Cost of bananas: $4
- Cost of oranges: $6

Total cost = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14

So, Catherine pays a total of $14."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

Greta bakes 30 cookies. Celinda bakes twice as many, so she bakes 60 cookies. Together, they bake 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

While the cookies are cooling, they eat 10 cookies. So, the number of cookies left is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is 80.

The answer is: **80**"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We have one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. Their combined ages are 44.

Let's say the age of one triplet is \( T \). Then the age of the twin is \( T + 7 \).

The combined ages of the twins and triplets are:
\[ T + (T + 7) + T + T + T = 44 \]
\[ 4T + 7 = 44 \]

Now, let's solve for \( T \):
\[ 4T = 44 - 7 \]
\[ 4T = 37 \]
\[ T = \frac{37}{4} \]
\[ T = 9.25 \]

So, the age of one triplet is 9.25 years. The age of the twin is:
\[ T + 7 = 9.25 + 7 = 16.25 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 16.25 years old.

The final answer is:
\[ 16.25 \]"
"John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner, which is 180 minutes. He needs to do his homework which takes 20 minutes for math, 40 minutes for reading, and 20 minutes for history. So, the total time for his homework is 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. To find out how many minutes he has left for a nap, we subtract the time he spends on homework from the time he has before dinner. 

180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap. The correct answer is 100 minutes."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm in primary school.

First, we know Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. So, the cost of five lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the four candies cost:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, each candy costs:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we want to know how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost is $7.00."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves a bit more coins than Rong. Neil saves 2/5 times more than Rong, which means Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins every month.

Now, if they save this way for 10 years, we need to find out how many coins each of them saves in 10 years.

There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are 10 * 12 = 120 months.

Rong saves 20 coins every month, so in 120 months, he saves 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.

Neil saves 28 coins every month, so in 120 months, he saves 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.

Now, to find out how many coins they have together, we add the coins Rong saved to the coins Neil saved: 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.

So, the total number of coins they have after 10 years is 5760 coins."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill. Let's say the heartworm check costs \( x \) dollars. So, the total bill is the cost of the vaccines plus the heartworm check:
\[ \text{Total bill} = 40 + x \]

We know that the heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill, so:
\[ x = 0.6 \times (40 + x) \]

Let's solve this step by step:
\[ x = 0.6 \times 40 + 0.6x \]
\[ x = 24 + 0.6x \]
\[ x - 0.6x = 24 \]
\[ 0.4x = 24 \]
\[ x = \frac{24}{0.4} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the heartworm check costs $60. Now, the total bill is:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John leaves with $25. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out the price of the crate of fruit.

First, we need to know how much each type of fruit costs:
- One apple costs $0.5.
- One banana costs twice as much as one apple, so it's $0.5 * 2 = $1.0.
- One orange costs three times as much as one banana, so it's $1.0 * 3 = $3.0.

Now, let's calculate the cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The crate has 5 bananas, so the cost for bananas is 5 * $1.0 = $5.0.
- The crate has 12 apples, so the cost for apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.0.
- The crate has 7 oranges, so the cost for oranges is 7 * $3.0 = $21.0.

To find the total cost of the crate, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
- Total cost = cost of bananas + cost of apples + cost of oranges
- Total cost = $5.0 + $6.0 + $21.0 = $32.0

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is $32.0."
"To find out how many square feet Brittany's comforter is, we need to count all the colored squares and then figure out the total area.

First, we know there are 14 red squares.

Next, we find out how many blue squares there are. The problem says there are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, we add 4 to the number of red squares:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]
So, there are 18 blue squares.

Then, we find out how many green squares there are. The problem says there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, we add 6 to the number of blue squares:
\[ 18 + 6 = 24 \]
So, there are 24 green squares.

Finally, we find out how many white squares there are. The problem says there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, we subtract 12 from the number of green squares:
\[ 24 - 12 = 12 \]
So, there are 12 white squares.

Now, we add up all the squares:
\[ 14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68 \text{ squares} \]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, each square has an area of 1 square foot. So, the total area of the comforter is:
\[ 68 \text{ square feet} \]

The answer is: \boxed{68}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 42 adults and 15 babies coming to the function. So, the total number of people is:
   \[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

2. The restaurant has 8 high chairs. It also has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is:
   \[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

3. Now, we add the high chairs and the regular chairs to find out how many chairs are there in total:
   \[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

4. We need to find out how many more chairs are needed to have enough for all 57 people. So, we subtract the number of chairs the restaurant has from the total number of people:
   \[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Therefore, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To find out how many 8-point bucks there are, we start by figuring out how many bucks there are in total. Since 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we calculate:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.50 \times 50 = 25 \text{ bucks} \]

Now, we need to find out how many of these 25 bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

So, the number of 8-point bucks is 5. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

First, we know Adam has collected 50 points. Betty collected 30% more than Adam. To find out how many points Betty collected, we calculate:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \]
So, Betty collected:
\[ 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points} \]

Next, Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points, so:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ points} \]

Now, we add up all the points collected by Adam, Betty, Marta, and Tom:
\[ 50 + 65 + 90 + 30 = 235 \text{ points} \]

The class needs at least 400 points to go on the trip. To find out how many points they are missing, we subtract the points they have from the minimum required:
\[ 400 - 235 = 165 \text{ points} \]

So, the class is missing \(\boxed{165}\) points to go on the trip."
"Great Grandma Jones has three children. Each of her children has three children of their own, which are Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren. And each of these grandchildren has three babies of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' great grand-babies.

To find out how many great grand-babies there are, we need to count step by step:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her 3 children has 3 grandchildren.
   - So, the total number of grandchildren is 3 children * 3 grandchildren per child = 9 grandchildren.
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 great grand-babies.
   - So, the total number of great grand-babies is 9 grandchildren * 3 great grand-babies per grandchild = 27 great grand-babies.

So, if all of the family members show up at the family reunion, there will be 27 great grand-babies for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.

The number of great grand-babies is 27."
"Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account, so she puts $2400.00 * 0.50 = $1200.00 into her retirement account. Then she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment, so she uses $2400.00 * 0.20 = $480.00 for her car payment. After putting money into her retirement account and paying for her car, the money left for Greta to spend is $2400.00 - $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00. So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720.00.

The correct answer is $720.00."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. The box can hold 20 pencils.
2. But 4 pencils are missing, so we need to find out how many pencils are actually in the box now.
3. If we subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity, we get:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16
   \]
   So, there are 16 pencils in the box now.
4. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils there are. Since each pair has 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2:
   \[
   16 \div 2 = 8
   \]
   So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many fireworks there are in total. The city is setting off 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 20 fireworks. So, we multiply 15 by 20:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]
There are 300 fireworks in total.

Next, we need to find out how many fireworks Hannah can see. The problem says she can see 40% of the fireworks. To find 40% of 300, we do:
\[ 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \]
So, Hannah can see 120 fireworks from the display.

Now, Hannah also sets off 3 boxes of fireworks in her backyard. Each box has 5 fireworks, so we multiply 3 by 5:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Hannah sets off 15 fireworks in her backyard.

To find out the total number of fireworks Hannah sees, we add the fireworks she sees from the display to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard:
\[ 120 + 15 = 135 \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah sees is 135. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"

Larry cooked dumplings for a group of friends. There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females. Each female ate 3 dumplings, and each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. We need to find out how many dumplings Larry cooked.

First, let's find out how many dumplings the females ate. There are 6 females, and each ate 3 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings the females ate is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Next, let's find out how many dumplings the males ate. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]
There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings the males ate is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

Now, to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the males:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

So, Larry cooked 50 dumplings. The answer is 50."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means for every 5 parts, Gerald gets 3 parts and Julia gets 2 parts.

First, we find out how much one part is:
\[ \text{Total parts} = 3 + 2 = 5 \]
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now, we calculate how much Gerald got:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract that from his share:
\[ \text{Money left with Gerald} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

So, the amount of money Gerald had left is:

"To find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to know how fast the turtle is. The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat runs at 15 feet per second. So, to find the turtle's speed, we divide the cat's speed by 5:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the turtle can crawl:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The correct answer is:

"To find out what percent of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, let's break it down step by step:

1. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. Out of the 40% that Colorado City uses, 80% is used for industrial purposes.
3. So, the rest of the water used by Colorado City is for non-industrial purposes.

First, we need to find out what 20% of the 40% is because that's the non-industrial part. We do this by calculating:
\[ 40\% \times (100\% - 80\%) = 40\% \times 20\% = 8\% \]

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

\[ 15.00 + 10.00 + 12.00 + 13.00 = 50.00 \]

Marcus gets a 10% discount on his total bill. To find the discount, we calculate 10% of $50.00:
\[ 0.10 \times 50.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the total bill after the discount is:
\[ 50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00 \]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"The ice cream parlor has a deal where you buy 2 scoops and get 1 scoop free. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00.

To find out how many scoops Erin can get with $6.00, let's see how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy:

- 2 scoops cost $3.00.
- So, with $6.00, she can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops.

Each set of 3 scoops means she gets 3 scoops for $3.00. So, with $6.00, she can get:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

Therefore, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's find out how many days are in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Now, let's see how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after 14 days, Ginger will have:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's see how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after 14 days, Amy will have:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To find out how many tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we first need to calculate the area he wants to cover. He wants to cover two thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom. So, we calculate two thirds of 36:

\[ \text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know that for every square foot, he needs 24 tiles. So, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles needed is:

\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ square feet} \times 24 \text{ tiles/square foot} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden needs 576 tiles. The correct answer is:

576"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

James had to pay $20 to go pick the blueberries and then $1.5 for each pound he picked. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:
\[ 30 \times 1.5 = 45 \]
Adding the cost to go picking, the total cost is:
\[ 20 + 45 = 65 \]

Now, if he bought the same 30 pounds of blueberries at the store at $2.5 per pound, the cost would be:
\[ 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \]

To find out how much he saved, we subtract the cost he paid from the cost at the store:
\[ 75 - 65 = 10 \]

So, James saved $10. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The company wanted to buy 500 computers at $700 each. So, the total they planned to spend was:
\[ 500 \times 700 = 350,000 \]

But the price of each computer went up by 10%. So, the new price of each computer is:
\[ 700 + (0.10 \times 700) = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, to find out how much they paid in total for 500 computers at the new price:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid is $385,000. 

The correct answer is:

"To find out how many calories are in John's omelet, we need to add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham.

First, let's look at the eggs:
- John uses 6 eggs.
- Each egg has 75 calories.
- So, the total calories from eggs = 6 × 75 = 450 calories.

Next, let's look at the cheese:
- John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
- Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
- So, the total calories from cheese = 2 × 120 = 240 calories.

Now, let's look at the ham:
- John uses 2 ounces of ham.
- Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
- So, the total calories from ham = 2 × 40 = 80 calories.

Finally, we add up all the calories:
- Total calories = calories from eggs + calories from cheese + calories from ham
- Total calories = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

So, the omelet has 770 calories. The correct answer is 770 calories."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

First, we need to find out how much 6 pencils cost. Each pencil costs $0.50, so:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]
So, 6 pencils cost $3.00.

Next, we need to find out how much 8 erasers cost. Each eraser costs $0.25, so:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]
So, 8 erasers cost $2.00.

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and the erasers together:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]
So, the total cost for 6 pencils and 8 erasers is $5.00.

If you paid $10 for these items, the change you would get is:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change you would get is $5.00."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know that 30% of the 100 people get an interview. So, we calculate:
   \[
   100 \times 0.30 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 people get an interview.

2. Next, 20% of these 30 people get a job offer. So, we calculate:
   \[
   30 \times 0.20 = 6
   \]
   So, 6 people get a job offer.

3. Finally, a third of these 6 people accept the job. So, we calculate:
   \[
   6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2
   \]
   So, 2 people accept the job.

Therefore, the number of people who accept the job is 2."
"Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. So, she gave away a total of 3 + 4 = 7 sacks of rice. Each sack has 25 kilograms of rice in it. So, the total kilograms of rice she gave to her cousin and brother is 7 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 175 kg.

The answer is: 175 kg."
"To find out how many more boxes of cereal Castle bought this week than last week, we need to do a few simple steps:

1. First, let's add up the boxes of cereal she bought this week. She bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops. So, we add these together:
   \[
   3 + 5 = 8
   \]
   So, she bought 8 boxes this week.

2. Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

3. Now, to find out how many more boxes she bought this week, we subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number she bought this week:
   \[
   8 - 4 = 4
   \]

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Helga dances for 5 minutes. In 2 of those minutes, she dances with her arms raised. So, for the other 3 minutes, she dances with both hands at her sides.

When she dances with both hands at her sides:
- Her right foot taps 300 times per minute.
- Her left foot taps 250 times per minute.
- So, together, her feet tap 300 + 250 = 550 times per minute.

In 3 minutes, she taps:
\[ 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps} \]

When she dances with her arms raised:
- Her right foot taps 200 times per minute.
- Her left foot taps 200 times per minute.
- So, together, her feet tap 200 + 200 = 400 times per minute.

In 2 minutes, she taps:
\[ 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps} \]

Now, to find the total number of taps, we add the taps from both parts:
\[ 1650 \text{ taps} + 800 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps} \]

So, the total number of taps is 2450. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, it will cost him $450 to fix the damage to his car.
2. If he decides to fix the pothole himself, he has to pay a fine of $120 and buy 3 buckets of asphalt.
3. Each bucket of asphalt costs $25, so 3 buckets cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.
4. Adding the fine and the cost of the asphalt, the total cost is \(120 + 75 = 195\) dollars.
5. To find out how much money Ron saves, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage to his car: \(450 - 195 = 255\) dollars.

So, Ron saves 255 dollars by fixing the pothole himself. The answer is 255."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The restaurant starts with 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs.
2. Some chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair:
   - 20 normal chairs were sent.
   - 13 baby chairs were sent.
3. To find out how many normal chairs are left, we subtract the sent chairs from the total:
   - \(170 - 20 = 150\) normal chairs left.
4. To find out how many baby chairs are left, we subtract the sent chairs from the total:
   - \(23 - 13 = 10\) baby chairs left.
5. Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to find the total number of chairs left:
   - \(150 + 10 = 160\) chairs in total.

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left. The correct answer is 160."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people (Bryce and his 4 friends), so they ordered 5 pizzas.
2. So, the total number of slices is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) slices.
3. Bryce and two friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. They ate \(\frac{2}{3} \times 3 = 2\) pizzas.
4. So, they ate \(2 \times 12 = 24\) slices.
5. The other two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. They ate \(\frac{3}{4} \times 2 = 1.5\) pizzas, but since we can't have half a pizza in slices, we'll consider it as 1.5 pizzas, which is \(1.5 \times 12 = 18\) slices.
6. In total, they ate \(24 + 18 = 42\) slices.
7. So, the number of slices left is \(60 - 42 = 18\).

The number of slices of pizza left is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages but in 2/3 of the time the cat takes. So, we need to find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages.

First, we calculate how long it takes the dog:
- The cat takes 30 minutes.
- The dog takes 2/3 of 30 minutes.
- So, the dog takes \( \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \) minutes.

Now, we need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. We add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, and then divide by 2.

- The cat takes 30 minutes.
- The dog takes 20 minutes.
- The average time is \( \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) minutes.

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know Topher's shoe is 100 inches long. The problem says this is 10 inches more than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. So, if we let the length of Bobby's shoe be \( x \) inches, then we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Now, we need to find out what \( x \) is. First, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of Bobby's shoe is 10 inches. 

The answer is: \(\boxed{10}\)"
"Okay, let me explain it simply without the big numbers.

Hannah smashes windows in two types of cars: students' cars and teachers' cars.

First, there are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Next, there are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Now, Hannah smashes:
- A quarter of the students' cars' windows, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]
- Three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows, which is:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \text{ windows} \]

The final answer is:

"To find out what percentage of the spools are blue, we first need to add up all the spools Candy has.

Candy has:
- 15 light blue spools
- 45 dark blue spools
- 40 light green spools
- 50 dark green spools

First, let's add up all the spools:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools in total.

Now, we need to find out how many of these are blue. We add the blue spools together:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools.

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

So we have:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Now, we multiply by 100 to get the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{2}{5} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of the spools are blue. The correct answer is 40%."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. At the start, there were 5000 people who lined up to vote.
2. By midday, 2/5 of these people had voted. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \text{ people voted by midday.}
   \]
3. This means that after midday, the number of people left is:
   \[
   5000 - 2000 = 3000 \text{ people remained.
   }
4. By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people voted. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \text{ people voted by 16:00.}
   \]
5. This means that the number of people who did not vote by 16:00 is:
   \[
   3000 - 2000 = 1000 \text{ people.
   }
   
So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we first need to know how many pieces of gum he will chew in that time. He chews 4 pieces a day, so in 30 days, he will chew:

\[ 4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ pieces of gum} \]

Now, we know that each pack of gum has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total pieces of gum by the number of pieces in a pack:

\[ \frac{120}{15} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many smores are needed in total. There are 9 kids and each wants 2 smores, so that's \(9 \times 2 = 18\) smores. There are also 6 adults and each wants 1 smore, so that's \(6 \times 1 = 6\) smores. Adding these together, we get \(18 + 6 = 24\) smores in total.

2. Each sleeve of graham crackers can make 8 smores. So, to find out how many sleeves are needed for 24 smores, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores each sleeve can make: \(24 \div 8 = 3\) sleeves.

3. Each box of graham crackers has 3 sleeves. So, to find out how many boxes are needed for 3 sleeves, we divide the number of sleeves needed by the number of sleeves in a box: \(3 \div 3 = 1\) box.

So, they will need \(\boxed{1}\) box of graham crackers."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know Dora is 15 years old. Her father is eight more than twice her age. So, we calculate her father's age like this:

1. Twice Dora's age is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
2. Eight more than 30 is \(30 + 8 = 38\).

So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, we calculate her mother's age like this:

1. Four years younger than 38 is \(38 - 4 = 34\).

So, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

Now, to find the total age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

1. Dora's age is 15.
2. Her father's age is 38.
3. Her mother's age is 34.

Adding these together: \(15 + 38 + 34 = 87\).

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{87}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Cindy has:
- 2 math books, each 2 pounds, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- 2 science books, each 2 pounds, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- 1 French book that weighs 4 pounds.
- 1 English book that weighs 3 pounds.
- 1 history book that weighs twice as much as the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:
- Math and science books: \(4 + 4 = 8\) pounds.
- French book: 4 pounds.
- English book: 3 pounds.
- History book: 6 pounds.

Adding these together:
\[8 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 21\]

So, the total weight of all the books Cindy is carrying is 21 pounds. The answer is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for candidate C's votes.

First, we know there were 100 voters in total.

Candidate A got 20% of the votes. So, we calculate 20% of 100:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]
So, candidate A got 20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. To find out how many more votes that is, we calculate 50% of 20:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]
So, candidate B got 10 more votes than candidate A, which means:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]
So, candidate B got 30 votes.

Now, to find out how many votes candidate C got, we subtract the votes of candidates A and B from the total votes:
\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, candidate C got 50 votes.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply:

Boris starts with 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives 10 apples to Beck. So, Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's apples from Boris's apples: 90 - 87 = 3.

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The answer is 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Peter has 32 ounces of water to make ice cubes. He makes:
- 3 giant cubes, each using 4 ounces of water.
- 7 medium cubes, each using 2 ounces of water.
- 8 small cubes, each using 1/2 an ounce of water.

First, let's calculate how much water he uses for the giant cubes:
- 3 giant cubes × 4 ounces each = 12 ounces

Next, let's calculate how much water he uses for the medium cubes:
- 7 medium cubes × 2 ounces each = 14 ounces

Then, let's calculate how much water he uses for the small cubes:
- 8 small cubes × 1/2 ounce each = 4 ounces

Now, let's add up all the water used:
- Water used for giant cubes: 12 ounces
- Water used for medium cubes: 14 ounces
- Water used for small cubes: 4 ounces

Total water used = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces

Now, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
- Initial water: 32 ounces
- Water left: 32 - 30 = 2 ounces

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left. The answer is \boxed{2}."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Clara has 20 books. Clara has twice as many books as Steven, so Steven has half of Clara's books. That means Steven has:

\[ 20 \div 2 = 10 \text{ books} \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has:

\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ books} \]

Now, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

First, we need to find out how much a half-gallon jar costs. We know a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 less than a half-gallon jar. So, we subtract $2 from $5 to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Next, we need to find out how much Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

1. The cost of 10 gallon jars:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

2. The cost of 16 half-gallon jars:
\[ 16 \times 3 = 48 \]

Now, we add these two amounts together to find the total cost:
\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is $98."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We know there are 50 students in total. Out of these, 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like either video games or music is \(50 - 10 - 5 = 35\).

The problem also tells us that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

Now, we know that 35 students like either video games or music. If 10 students like to play music, then the rest must like video games. So, the number of students who like video games is \(35 - 10 = 25\).

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Jeremy saw 12 birds in his backyard. When he threw a stone, he scared away 1 out of every 3 birds, so that's 12 divided by 3, which is 4 birds. So, 12 minus 4 is 8 birds left.

Then, 20 more birds came to join the backyard. So, we add the 20 birds to the 8 birds that were left. That makes 8 plus 20, which is 28 birds.

So, the total number of birds in the backyard now is 28."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know there are 80 students in total, and they are divided into two classes with the same number of students in each class. So, each class has:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

In each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find out how many girls are in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
\[ 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Since each class has 40 students and 16 of them are girls, the rest must be boys. So, the number of boys in each class is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

So, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."

5. Her friend then stole 5 slices from the plate.
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ slices}
   \]

So, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8.

The correct answer is \boxed{8}."
"To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first add up all the animals she has to groom:

- Dogs: 8
- Cats: 5
- Birds: 3
- Horses: 12

Adding these together:
\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Melissa has 28 animals to groom in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of animals by 7 to find out how many animals she grooms each day:
\[ 28 \div 7 = 4 \]

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The number of animals she grooms each day is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Mark buys 3 packs of magic cards for $1800 each. So, the total cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \text{ dollars} \]

He gets 1 card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. So, the total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + 30 \times 50 = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much profit he made, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Mark made is:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the family to understand how much they can save.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to go to each park.

For the first park:
- Each adult costs $26.
- Each child costs $12.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children.

So, the cost for the adults at the first park is:
\[ 2 \times 26 = 52 \]

And the cost for the children at the first park is:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Adding these together, the total cost for the first park is:
\[ 52 + 24 = 76 \]

Now, for the second park:
- Each adult costs $14.
- Each child costs $10.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children.

So, the cost for the adults at the second park is:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]

And the cost for the children at the second park is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Adding these together, the total cost for the second park is:
\[ 28 + 20 = 48 \]

To find out how much they can save by choosing the second park, we subtract the cost of the second park from the cost of the first park:
\[ 76 - 48 = 28 \]

So, the family can save $28 by choosing the second park. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how much the vendor spends on tomatoes each day. He used to buy 500 tomatoes at $0.5 each, so:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, with the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes but at $0.4 each, so:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

The difference in cost each day is:
\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly savings are:
\[ \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$350/\text{week} \]

So, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Sean has 56 marbles. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so:

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have together, we add their marbles:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined. The answer is 336."
"To solve this, let's think about it step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups. We have 54 students, and we want to divide them into 12 groups equally.

1. If we divide 54 students into 12 groups, we get:
   \[
   \frac{54}{12} = 4.5
   \]
   Since we can't have half a student, this means we can't divide the students into 12 groups of equal size.

2. Now, let's think about dividing the students into 6 groups instead. If we divide 54 students into 6 groups, we get:
   \[
   \frac{54}{6} = 9
   \]
   This means each group would have 9 students, which is a whole number.

3. The question asks how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups. Since we can only form 6 groups with 54 students, we need:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6
   \]
   more groups.

So, the number of additional groups needed is 6.

The correct answer is: **6**"
"To find out how many chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many chairs Candy rents out in one 4-week month. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. So, in 4 weeks, there are:
- 5 weekdays/day * 4 days/week = 20 weekdays
- 2 weekend days/day * 4 days/week = 8 weekend days

Now, let's calculate the chairs rented out:
- On weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs each day. So, in 20 weekdays, she rents out 60 chairs/day * 20 days = 1200 chairs.
- On weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs each day. So, in 8 weekend days, she rents out 100 chairs/day * 8 days = 800 chairs.

Adding these together, the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is:
1200 chairs (from weekdays) + 800 chairs (from weekends) = 2000 chairs.

Since we are looking at two 4-week months, we multiply the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
2000 chairs * 2 = 4000 chairs.

So, the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months is 4000 chairs. The correct answer is 4000."
"Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Gunther starts with 48 bananas.
2. Arnold steals half of them. So, Arnold takes 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.
   - Now, Gunther has 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.
3. Gunther adds 25 more bananas to his pile.
   - Now, Gunther has 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.
4. Arnold steals 12 more bananas.
   - Now, Gunther has 49 - 12 = 37 bananas left.
5. Gunther adds 6 more bananas.
   - Now, Gunther has 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.

So, the number of bananas Gunther finds in the pile is 43.

The final answer is 43."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for easier understanding.

Jenna and her 4 roommates share the electricity bill. Each month, the bill is $100. We need to find out how much each roommate pays in a year.

First, we find out how much each roommate pays each month:
- There are 4 roommates, and the bill is $100 each month.
- So, each roommate pays $100 ÷ 4 = $25 each month.

Next, we need to find out how much each roommate pays in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
- Each roommate pays $25 × 12 = $300 in a year.

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 times 12, so that's 96 glasses.
- 4 dozen plates, which is 4 times 12, so that's 48 plates.

When they were returned, 10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were broken.

So, the number of glasses left is:
96 glasses - 10 broken glasses = 86 glasses

And the number of plates left is:
48 plates - 6 broken plates = 42 plates

Now, to find out how many items Jeff has now, we add the glasses and plates together:
86 glasses + 42 plates = 128 items

So, Jeff has 128 items now. The answer is 128."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. So, she trades 90% of 30 small stickers, which is 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 large buttons in return.

Now, she has 3 small stickers left and 40 - 27 = 13 large stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. So, she trades 50% of 13 large stickers, which is 6.5. Since she can't trade half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 6 large stickers (rounding down). Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, so trading 6 large stickers gives her 6 large buttons.

Now, she has 13 - 6 = 7 large stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so 7 large stickers give her 7 * 3 = 21 small buttons.

Adding up all the buttons she has:
- 27 large buttons from trading small stickers
- 6 large buttons from trading large stickers
- 21 small buttons from trading large stickers

So, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 6 + 21 = 54.

The final number of buttons Lorraine has is 54."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Joey played:
- 2 matches on Monday
- 1 match on Friday
- Double the number of matches he played on Monday on Saturday, which means he played 2 times 2, so 4 matches on Saturday

Now, let's add them up:
2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7

So, Joey played 7 matches in one week. The answer is 7."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 33 people on the council. The problem says the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor as there were against it. So, if we let the number of votes against be \( x \), then the number of votes in favor would be \( 2x \).

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). We know this total is 33, so we can write the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, there were 11 votes against the new regulation. Since the votes in favor were twice the votes against, we multiply 11 by 2:

\[ 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is 22."
"To find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order, let's count them step by step:

1. There are 11 students who need extra-small (XS) shirts.
2. Twice as many students need small (S) shirts as extra-small (XS) shirts. So, the number of students needing S shirts is 2 times 11, which is 22.
3. Four less than the number of small (S) shirts need medium (M) shirts. So, the number of students needing M shirts is 22 - 4, which is 18.
4. Half as many students need large (L) shirts as medium (M) shirts. So, the number of students needing L shirts is 18 / 2, which is 9.
5. Six more students need extra-large (XL) shirts than large (L) shirts. So, the number of students needing XL shirts is 9 + 6, which is 15.

Now, let's add up all the shirts:
- Extra-small (XS): 11 shirts
- Small (S): 22 shirts
- Medium (M): 18 shirts
- Large (L): 9 shirts
- Extra-large (XL): 15 shirts

Total shirts = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts

So, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts. The answer is 75."
"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to calculate how much the discount is. A 5% discount means you save 5 cents for every dollar. So, for $140, you save:

\[ 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

This means you save $7. So, you will pay:

\[ 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, the amount you will pay after the discount is $133."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John has 20 playlists, and each playlist has 300 songs. So, we first find out how many songs are there in total:
\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Each song is 10 hours long. So, to find out the total number of hours for all the songs, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:
\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is:
\[ \boxed{60000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \text{ people} \]

2. So, after 10 people think horse #2 will win, the rest of the people are:
   \[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people} \]

3. Now, 60% of these 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[ 60\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 24 \text{ people} \]

4. The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. So, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the 40 people left:
   \[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. And one third of those Pomeranians are girls. We also know there are 6 Pomeranian girls.

First, let's find out how many Pomeranian puppies there are in total. Since 6 is one third of the Pomeranian puppies, we can find the total by multiplying 6 by 3:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]
So, there are 18 Pomeranian puppies.

Now, we know that these 18 Pomeranian puppies are two thirds of all the puppies Jana has. To find the total number of puppies, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \]

To find the total number of puppies, we need to divide 18 by \(\frac{2}{3}\). This is the same as multiplying 18 by \(\frac{3}{2}\):
\[ \text{Total Puppies} = 18 \times \frac{3}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has 27 puppies in total. The correct answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"Jayden had $70 from selling pictures. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the money he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85. So, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera. The answer is $85."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total number of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Let's say the second house needs \( x \) shingles. Then the first house needs half of what the second house needs, so it needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) shingles. The third house needs double what the first house needs, so it needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) shingles.

So, the total shingles needed can be written as:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 shingles. The third house needs double what the second house needs, which is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house needs 100 shingles.

The correct answer is: **100**"

2. Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each.
   - 5 tomatoes × $1 per tomato = $5

3. Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3 each.
   - 1 head of lettuce × $3 per head of lettuce = $3

Now, let's add up all the money they spent:
- Leila spent $6
- Jack spent $5
- Chase spent $3

So, the total amount spent is:
- $6 + $5 + $3 = $14

Therefore, the total amount they spent together is $14."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

George has 200 bananas. He has 45% more pears than bananas. To find out how many pears he has, we first need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas:

\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas. Adding these pears to the bananas gives:

\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \text{ pears} \]

Now, to find out the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears together:

\[ 200 \text{ bananas} + 290 \text{ pears} = 490 \text{ fruits} \]

So, the total number of fruits George has is 490."
"Marissa had $80 and she spent $20 on a ball. So, she had $60 left. Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she can buy, we divide the money she has left by the cost of one candy bar:

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy. The answer is 12."
"To find out how much money Sam needs to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that 1 liter of juice needs 5 kilograms of oranges.
2. So, for 4 liters of juice, Sam needs:
   \[
   4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kilograms/liter} = 20 \text{ kilograms of oranges}
   \]
3. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3.
4. Therefore, the cost for 20 kilograms of oranges is:
   \[
   20 \text{ kilograms} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Sam would have to spend **60 dollars** to make 4 liters of juice."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. We know Ezra read 300 books in one hour.
2. We also know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. So, if Ahmed read \( A \) books, then \( 2A = 300 \).
3. To find out how many books Ahmed read, we divide 300 by 2:
   \[
   A = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]
   So, Ahmed read 150 books.
4. Now, we need to find out how many books they read altogether. We add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read:
   \[
   300 + 150 = 450
   \]

So, the total number of books they read altogether is 450. The correct answer is 450."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for Monday and Wednesday.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each day.
- She earns $15 for each hour.
- She also gets an extra $5 if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Since she teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, she gets an extra $5:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each day.
- She earns $15 for each hour.
- She doesn't get the extra $5 because she teaches only 2 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Now, add up the earnings for both days:
\[ \$305 + \$60 = \$365 \]

So, Tanya earned a total of \$365 for these two days of teaching. The correct answer is \(\boxed{365}\)."
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, we know the company sold 5 vanilla scents and 2 fruity scents each by the end of the day.

To find out how many vanilla scents were sold in total:
\[ 5 \text{ vanilla scents/sale} \times 5 \text{ sales} = 25 \text{ vanilla scents} \]

Next, to find out how many fruity scents were sold in total:
\[ 2 \text{ fruity scents/sale} \times 2 \text{ sales} = 4 \text{ fruity scents} \]

Now, to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents:
\[ 25 \text{ vanilla scents} - 4 \text{ fruity scents} = 21 \text{ more vanilla scents} \]

So, the number of vanilla scents sold is 21 more than the number of fruity scents sold. The answer is 21."

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3. The answer is $3."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so in total, she has 12 hours over the weekend.

She spends 3 hours reading and 3 hours playing video games. That's 3 + 3 = 6 hours spent on reading and video games.

So, the time left for soccer is 12 hours - 6 hours = 6 hours.

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we do this:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.

The correct answer is: **50%**"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Anthony started with 50 pencils.
2. He gave half of his pencils to Brandon. So, he gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \) pencils to Brandon.
3. After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony has \( 50 - 25 = 25 \) pencils left.
4. Then, he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. So, he gave \( \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \) pencils to Charlie.
5. After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, Anthony has \( 25 - 15 = 10 \) pencils left.

So, Anthony kept 10 pencils. The answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Jack drives 150 miles to the museum and 150 miles back home. He drives at 75 mph for both trips.

To find out how long it takes him to drive to the museum, we divide the distance by the speed:
\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since he drives the same distance back, it also takes him 2 hours. So, the total driving time is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is:
\[ 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time Jack is gone from home is 10 hours. The answer is 10 hours."
"Henry needs wheels for 57 cars and 73 motorcycles. Each car needs 4 wheels, so for 57 cars, he needs:
\[ 57 \times 4 = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, so for 73 motorcycles, he needs:
\[ 73 \times 2 = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Adding these together, he needs:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels are left after he uses 374 wheels, we subtract:
\[ 650 - 374 = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

So, the number of wheels left is 276. The correct answer is:
\[ \text{276} \]"
"To find out how much you have to pay after a 20% discount on a laptop that costs $1000, first, we need to calculate 20% of $1000. 

20% of $1000 is:
\[ 20\% \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

Now, subtract this discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

So, after the discount, you have to pay $800.

The final answer is:

"Mike has 600 movies. A third of these are in series, so he has 200 series movies. The rest are not in series, which is 600 - 200 = 400 movies.

Out of these 400 movies, 40% are older movies. So, the number of older movies is 40% of 400, which is 0.4 * 400 = 160 movies.

The rest of the non-series movies are not older, so that's 400 - 160 = 240 movies.

Now, let's calculate the cost:
- The series movies cost $6 each, so 200 series movies cost 200 * $6 = $1200.
- The non-older movies cost $10 each, so 240 non-older movies cost 240 * $10 = $2400.
- The older movies cost $5 each, so 160 older movies cost 160 * $5 = $800.

Adding these costs together, the total cost is $1200 + $2400 + $800 = $4400.

So, the total cost to replace the movies is $4400."
"To find out how much Winston spent, we need to add up the cost of the peaches, plums, and apricots he picked.

First, let's calculate the cost of the peaches:
- He picked 6 pounds of peaches.
- Peaches cost $2.00 per pound.
- So, the cost for peaches is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the plums:
- He picked 8 pounds of plums.
- Plums cost $1.00 per pound.
- So, the cost for plums is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the apricots:
- He picked 6 pounds of apricots.
- Apricots cost $3.00 per pound.
- So, the cost for apricots is \(6 \times 3 = 18\) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Cost of peaches: $12.00
- Cost of plums: $8.00
- Cost of apricots: $18.00

Adding these together: \(12 + 8 + 18 = 38\) dollars.

So, Winston spent \(\boxed{38}\) dollars on fruit."
"To find out how far the vacation spot is, we need to add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked.

First, they drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour. So, the distance they drove is:
\[ 50 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, they hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of 50 miles per hour is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles/hour} \]
So, their hiking speed is:
\[ 25 \text{ miles/hour} - 5 \text{ miles/hour} = 20 \text{ miles/hour} \]
The distance they hiked is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 330 \text{ miles} \]

So, the vacation spot is 330 miles away. The answer is 330 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Ava and Emma are playing a video game. They get points in different ways:
- 10 points for every enemy they jump on.
- 5 points for each berry they collect.
- 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. But she finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.

First, let's calculate the points for enemies:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she gets 8 * 10 = 80 points from enemies.
- Emma jumps on E enemies, so she gets E * 10 points from enemies.

Next, let's calculate the points for berries:
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she gets 3 * 5 = 15 points from berries.
- Emma collects B berries, so she gets B * 5 points from berries.

Finally, let's calculate the points for the timer:
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she loses 4 * 30 = 120 points from the timer.
- Emma finishes in T seconds, so she gets T * 30 points from the timer.

Now, let's put it all together:
- Ava's total score = 80 + 15 - 120 = -25
- Emma's total score = (E * 10) + (B * 5) - (T * 30)

The difference between their scores is:
- Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score = -25 - ((E * 10) + (B * 5) - (T * 30))

Since we don't have the exact numbers for E, B, and T, we can't calculate the exact difference. But we know the difference in points is 190.

So, the difference between their scores is 190 points.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{190} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so together they cost:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know the total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. So, the cost for the other two pizzas is:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each of the other two pizzas costs 2 dollars. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day. They do this for 5 days. So, for these 5 days, they ride:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ times} \]

On the other 2 days, they ride twice as much as usual. So, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ times} \]
And for 2 days, they ride:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ times} \]

Now, let's add all these together:
\[ 15 + 12 = 27 \text{ times} \]

So, they ride their bikes 27 times in a week. The answer is 27."
"Bob originally had 7 fish in his pond. 3 were orange and 4 were white. He got more fish from the pet store and now has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Let's figure out how many white fish he got from the store.

He got 17 fish in total from the store. Let's say he got \( w \) white fish and \( o \) orange fish. So, \( w + o = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

Let's solve this step by step. First, we simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Now, we substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation \( w + o = 17 \):
\[ w + (2w + 5) = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob got 4 white fish from the store. Let's check if this is correct:
- If he got 4 white fish, then he got \( 17 - 4 = 13 \) orange fish.
- After adding these fish, he has \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) orange fish and \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) white fish.
- 16 is indeed twice 8.

Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, let's break it down step by step.

Andy drives 5 miles to work and 5 miles back home each day. So, the total distance he drives in a day is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} + 5 \text{ miles} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \]

Since he goes to work from Monday to Friday, the total distance he drives in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

His car is 10 miles per gallon, so the number of gallons he uses in a week is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the cost of gas per week is:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the money Andy's car is consuming per week is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Carrie has ten twenties. Each twenty is $20, so ten twenties are:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She also has 140 quarters. Each quarter is $0.25, so 140 quarters are:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, she spent all the quarters, which is $35. She also spent 3/5 of the twenties. 3/5 of $200 is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount she spent is:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Ricardo has tomato plants and eggplant plants. Each tomato plant gives him 22 tomatoes, and each eggplant plant gives him 4 eggplants. He has 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants.

First, we calculate the tomatoes:
- 5 tomato plants × 22 tomatoes per plant = 110 tomatoes

Next, we calculate the eggplants:
- 8 eggplant plants × 4 eggplants per plant = 32 eggplants

Now, we add the tomatoes and eggplants together to find the total number of fruits:
- 110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

So, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants. The answer is 142."
"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we first need to know how many smart TVs and analog TVs were sold. 

One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, so:
\[ \text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, so:
\[ \text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \]

Now, to find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[ \text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25 \]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"To find out how much money John is missing, we need to follow these steps:

1. The trip costs $300.
2. The school will cover half of the trip cost, so the school will give John $300 / 2 = $150.
3. John already has $50.
4. To find out how much more money John needs, we subtract the money he already has from the amount the school will give him: $150 - $50 = $100.

So, John is missing $100. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The house gets cold at night and it's 33 degrees colder at night than during the day. If it's 45 degrees during the day, then at night it's:
\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes freeze if the temperature is below 32 degrees. So, we need to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees to keep the pipes from freezing. The difference is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to keep the pipes from freezing. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We have 90 people and they need to form groups of 9 people each.
   - So, we divide 90 by 9 to find out how many groups we can make:
     \[
     90 \div 9 = 10
     \]
   - This means we can make 10 groups.

2. Now, we know that 3 out of every 5 groups bring back seashells. To find out how many groups bring back seashells, we calculate:
   - We take 3/5 of the total groups:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 groups bring back seashells.

3. Each of these 6 groups brings back 2 seashells. To find out the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups that bring back seashells by 2:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is 12.

The final answer is 12."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The train starts with 172 people.
2. At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 people get on. So, we subtract 47 and then add 13:
   \[ 172 - 47 = 125 \]
   \[ 125 + 13 = 138 \]
3. At the next stop, 38 people get off. So, we subtract 38 from 138:
   \[ 138 - 38 = 100 \]

So, the number of people on the train is 100. The final answer is 100."
"To find out how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month, we need to follow these steps:

   - He finds 10 bottle caps each day.
   - In a 30-day month, he finds \( 10 \times 30 = 300 \) bottle caps.

2. Find out the value of these bottle caps.
   - Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.
   - So, the total value of 300 bottle caps is \( 300 \times 0.25 = 75 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Damien makes in a 30-day month is $75."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Jamie's pay.

Jamie works 8 hours at her regular pay rate of $20 per hour. So, for those 8 hours, she earns:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

She worked a total of 11 hours, so the remaining hours are:
\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

For those 3 extra hours, she gets paid 150% of her regular pay rate. So, her special pay rate is:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

For the 3 extra hours, she earns:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out her total pay for the day, we add the regular pay and the extra pay:
\[ 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on last Tuesday."
"To find out how many lions are in the enclosure, we start by counting the female lions, which is 12. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so we divide 12 by 2 to get the number of male lions:

\[ 12 \div 2 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 male lions. Now, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together:

\[ 12 \text{ (female lions)} + 6 \text{ (male lions)} + 14 \text{ (lion cubs)} = 32 \]

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"Mike saw his favorite jeans were 25% off, which means he only had to pay 75% of the original price. The original price was $40.00, so we calculate 75% of $40.00:

\[ 75\% \text{ of } 40.00 = 0.75 \times 40.00 = 30.00 \]

So, the jeans cost Mike $30.00. If he paid with a $50.00 bill, the money he has left over is:

\[ 50.00 - 30.00 = 20.00 \]

Therefore, the money Mike has left over is $20.00. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{20.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. The company starts with 200 employees.
2. Every month, they hire 20 new employees.
3. After 3 months, they will have hired \(20 \times 3 = 60\) new employees.
4. So, the total number of employees after 3 months will be \(200 + 60 = 260\).
5. Each employee is paid $4000 per month.
6. So, the total salary for all employees in one month is \(260 \times 4000 = 1040000\) dollars.
7. Over 3 months, the total salary will be \(1040000 \times 3 = 3120000\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3120000.

The final answer is: $3120000"
"To find out how long they will be caroling, we need to add up the time for singing ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells.""

First, we know ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long and they sing it twice. So, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is:
\[ 150 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 300 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long and they sing it once. So, the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is:
\[ 240 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, we add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells"":
\[ 300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

First, we need to find out how much Billy earns in total for 20 hours of work.

1. Billy's initial pay rate is $10 per hour.
2. After 2 months, his pay rate increases to $10.50 per hour.
3. On his first anniversary, his pay rate increases to $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much Billy earns in 20 hours at each rate:
- For the first 2 months (20 hours each month), he earns:
  \[
  10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- After the raise, for the next 20 hours, he earns:
  \[
  10.50 \times 20 = 210 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- On his first anniversary, for the next 20 hours, he earns:
  \[
  11.50 \times 20 = 230 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we add up all these amounts to find out how much Billy earns in total:
\[
200 + 210 + 230 = 640 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much Sally earns. Sally's starting pay rate is $0.50 more than Billy's initial pay rate:
\[
10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate how much Sally earns in 20 hours:
\[
10.50 \times 20 = 210 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much more Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's total earnings:
\[
640 - 210 = 430 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Billy earns $430 more than Sally in 20 hours. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{430}

"To find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, let's break it down step by step:

First, we calculate the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf costs $2.
- So, 3 loaves cost \(3 \times 2 = 6\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- So, 2 bagels cost \(2 \times 1 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost:
- The difference is \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost 4 dollars more than 2 bagels. The answer is 4 dollars."
"To find out how many points Nikita scored, we first need to calculate half of Pierson's score and then add 11 to it.

Pierson scored 278 points.

Half of Pierson's score is 278 divided by 2, which is 139 points.

Now, we add 11 to 139 to get Nikita's score: 139 + 11 = 150 points.

So, Pierson scored 278 points and Nikita scored 150 points.

To find the total points they both scored, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together: 278 + 150 = 428 points.

The total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428 points.

The correct answer is 428 points."
"To find out how many trees they will have planted, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students and teachers there are in total.

The school has 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

Next, each class has 3 teachers:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Now, we know that each student plants 1 tree and each teacher plants 2 trees.

So, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

And the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding these together gives us the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

So, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1240."
"Bubbles has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. That makes a total of 14 stuffed animals.

She wants the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. To find out how many stuffed goats she needs, we can set up a simple equation.

If \( x \) is the number of stuffed goats she needs, then 30% of \( 14 + x \) should equal \( x \).

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving this, we get:

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats. The answer is 6."
"Kris needs to play 30 hours to earn the achievement. She has already played 7 hours in the first 2 weeks and 14 hours in the last week. So, she has played a total of 7 + 14 = 21 hours. To find out how many more hours she needs to play, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total hours needed:

30 - 21 = 9

So, Kris still needs to play 9 more hours to earn the achievement. The answer is 9 hours."
"To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate how far each car travels in that time.

The first car travels at 60 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

The second car travels at 70 miles per hour. In 2 hours, it will travel:
\[ 70 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
\[ 140 \text{ miles} - 120 \text{ miles} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The answer is:
20 miles"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

James buys a ring that costs $600 for the diamond and $300 for the gold. So, the total cost before adding the premium is $600 + $300 = $900.

Now, he gets a 30% premium on the total cost. To find out how much the premium is, we calculate 30% of $900. That's 0.30 * $900 = $270.

So, the total cost after adding the premium is $900 + $270 = $1170.

Therefore, the amount James paid is $1170."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many students passed in each grade:

- In third grade, 340 out of 500 students passed. To find the pass rate, we do:
  \[
  \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \text{ or } 68\%
  \]
- In fourth grade, 40 out of 100 students passed. To find the pass rate, we do:
  \[
  \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \text{ or } 40\%
  \]
- In fifth grade, the pass rate is twice that of fourth grade, so:
  \[
  2 \times 40\% = 80\%
  \]
  This means 80 out of 100 fifth graders passed.

Now, let's add up how many students passed in each grade:
- Third grade: 340 students
- Fourth grade: 40 students
- Fifth grade: 80 students

So, the total number of students who passed is:
\[
340 + 40 + 80 = 460
\]

The total number of students in the school is:
\[
500 + 100 + 400 = 1000
\]

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of students who passed by the total number of students:
\[
\frac{460}{1000} = 0.46 \text{ or } 46\%
\]

So, the school's overall pass rate is:
\[
\boxed{46\%}
\]"
"Milo needs 12 glass chips to make one square inch of his mosaic. He has two bags of chips, and each bag has 72 chips. So, he has a total of 144 chips.

If it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, then with 144 chips, he can make:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how long the mosaic can be, we use the area of the mosaic, which is 12 square inches. If the height is 3 inches, then the length \( L \) can be found by:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Height} \]
\[ 12 \text{ square inches} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]
\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find out how much tea was at the beginning of the party, we need to add the tea left after the party to the tea that was drunk.

First, we calculate the total tea drunk by the students:
- 4 students each drank 1.5 quarts, so \(4 \times 1.5 = 6\) quarts.
- 16 students each drank 2 quarts, so \(16 \times 2 = 32\) quarts.
- Adding these together, the total tea drunk is \(6 + 32 = 38\) quarts.

We know there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students drank. So, the total tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert 48 quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way:

1. Dale started with 100 candies.
2. He sold 150 candies, but he only had 100 candies, so he ran out.
3. He then ordered 100 more candies.
4. Now he has 100 (from the first order) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies.
5. He has already sold 150 candies.
6. To find out how many more he needs to sell, we subtract the sold candies from the total candies he has now: 200 - 150 = 50.

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 more candies to sell all of his candy.

The answer is: **50**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

At the start of the year, there are 10 students. Every month, the number of students doubles.

- At the end of January, the number of students is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
- At the end of February, the number of students is \(20 \times 2 = 40\).
- At the end of March, the number of students is \(40 \times 2 = 80\).
- At the end of April, the number of students is \(80 \times 2 = 160\).
- At the end of May, the number of students is \(160 \times 2 = 320\).

Now, to find out how many more students joined by the end of May, we subtract the number of students at the start of the year from the number at the end of May:
\[320 - 10 = 310\]

So, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310. The answer is \(\boxed{310}\)."
"Felix made $105 by climbing branches. He charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. To find out how many branches he climbed, we divide the total money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ 105 \div 0.25 = 420 \text{ branches} \]

Felix made this money in one week, which has 7 days. To find out how many branches he climbed on average each day, we divide the total branches by the number of days:

\[ 420 \div 7 = 60 \text{ branches per day} \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The answer is 60."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Rose picks flowers and counts the petals:

1. She picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each. So, \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
2. Then she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. So, \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
3. Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each. So, \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. So, \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Now, let's add all these petals together:
\[15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\] petals.

But then she drops 1 flower of each type:
- 1 flower with 5 petals
- 1 flower with 6 petals
- 1 flower with 4 petals
- 1 flower with 7 petals

So, she drops \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals.

Now, we subtract the dropped petals from the total:
\[101 - 22 = 79\] petals.

So, the total number of petals left in the vase is 79."
"John and DeSean bought a bag of 35 marshmallows. They each made 9 S'mores, and they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. Let's find out how many marshmallows they have left.

First, we calculate the total number of marshmallows they used:
- John made 9 S'mores.
- DeSean made 9 S'mores.
- So, together they made \(9 + 9 = 18\) S'mores.

They dropped 3 marshmallows, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:
- Marshmallows used: 18
- Marshmallows dropped: 3
- Total used and dropped: \(18 + 3 = 21\)

Now, we subtract the total used and dropped from the original number of marshmallows:
- Original number of marshmallows: 35
- Marshmallows used and dropped: 21
- Marshmallows left: \(35 - 21 = 14\)

With 14 marshmallows left, we need to find out how many S'mores each can have:
- They have 14 marshmallows left.
- Each S'more uses 1 marshmallow.
- So, each can have \(14 \div 2 = 7\) S'mores.

Therefore, the number of S'mores each can have is 7. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. He plays for 20 minutes. That's 1 quarter.

Two of his friends can only play half as long as Jack, so they each play for 10 minutes. Together, they play for 10 + 10 = 20 minutes. That's 1 quarter for each of them, so 2 quarters.

The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he plays for 30 minutes. That's 1.5 quarters.

Now, let's add up all the quarters they use:
- Jack uses 1 quarter.
- The two worse friends use 2 quarters.
- The better friend uses 1.5 quarters.

So, the total number of quarters used is 1 + 2 + 1.5 = 4.5 quarters.

The question asks how much money is used, and the answer is 4.5 quarters. 

So, the final answer is 4.5 quarters."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Tanya makes a salt scrub that fills a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the same amount of salt as sugar, twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

Let's say she uses \( S \) ounces of salt. Then:
- She uses \( S \) ounces of sugar (same as salt).
- She uses \( S \) ounces of citrus zest (same as salt).
- She uses \( 2S \) ounces of oil (twice as much as salt).
- She uses \( S \) ounces of fragrance (same as salt).

So, the total amount of the mixture is:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, to find out how much oil she uses, we use:
\[ 2S = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil she uses is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}
\]"
"To find out how much money John spent, we need to add up the cost of the goats and the cows.

John bought 3 goats, and each goat costs $500. So, the total cost for the goats is:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

John also bought 2 cows, and each cow costs $1500. So, the total cost for the cows is:
\[ 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the goats and the cows together:
\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John spent a total of $4500. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{4500} \]"
"Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. So, he has a total of 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes. He needs 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more he needs to buy, we subtract the cupcakes he already has from the total he needs:

63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. The answer is 15."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. Robert has 20 cars.
2. Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.
3. Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.
4. Joe gives away twice as many cars as he sold, so he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.
5. After selling, Joe has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars left.
6. After giving some to his mother, Joe has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars left.

So, Joe remains with 16 cars. The answer is 16."
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to know how much money the students raised. The total money raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the students raised:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Now, there are 20 students, and they raised a total of $125,000. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, so she walked 4 hours.

To find out the total time she walked, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to change 12 hours into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

Hunter first counted 50 cars in the parking lot. Then, 20 more cars came, so he counted 50 + 20 = 70 cars after the first break.

During the lunch break, half of these 70 cars left the parking lot. So, we need to find half of 70, which is 70 ÷ 2 = 35.

So, the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The answer is: **35**"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know John does 30 cycles of work each day. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20.

So, the number of tasks John does each day is:
\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day} \]

Each task pays $1.20, so the money John makes each day is:
\[ 150 \text{ tasks/day} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$180/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily earnings by 7:
\[ \$180/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$1260 \]

So, John makes \$1260 in a full 7-day week. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{1260}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
2. Julie scored 4 points less than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.
3. In the second game, Julie scored 10 points (the same as in the first game).
4. Sasha scored 6 points less than Julie in the second game, so Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points in the second game.
5. To find the total points Sasha scored, we add the points from both games: \(14 + 4 = 18\).

So, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games. The answer is 18."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package has 11 tins. So, she got:
\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins of cat food} \]

She also bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package has 6 tins. So, she got:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins of dog food} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food she bought, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The answer is 52."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the total number of cards is 341. Let's say PJ has \( P \) cards. Then Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards because Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards each person has:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3 \times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards. The answer is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"Okay, let's count the eggs Cindy has:

- Cindy has 5 green eggs.
- She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she has \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs.
- She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she has \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs.
- She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she has \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs: \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\)

So, Cindy has 27 eggs in total. The answer is 27."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Milly to understand how much she will lose.

First, we need to find out how much the shipping will cost. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 for each pound. So, for 4 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 4 \times 0.35 = 1.40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the shipping company also charges $0.08 for each mile. The book needs to be sent 20 miles away, so the cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \times 0.08 = 1.60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost for the weight and the cost for the distance to find the total shipping cost:
\[ 1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Milly bought the book for $32, but she can only get back 75% of that money because Amazon refunds only 75%. So, the refundable amount is:
\[ 32 \times 0.75 = 24.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refundable amount from the total cost:
\[ 32 + 3.00 - 24.00 = 11.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Milly will lose \(\boxed{11}\) dollars."
"Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her $100, so she has $140 in total. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each, which cost $60, and a bag for $20. So, the total cost of the jeans and the bag is $60 + $20 = $80. Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from the money she had: $140 - $80 = $60. So, Mulan has $60 left. The answer is $60."
"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week, so:
\[ 8,000 \div 2 = 4,000 \text{ bars} \]

In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so:
\[ 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \text{ bars} \]

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly production to find out how many bars he produces in the fourth week:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week. The answer is 14,000 bars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Britany makes 18 TikTok videos each week. Each video is 4 minutes long, so she spends:
\[ 18 \times 4 = 72 \text{ minutes} \]
on TikTok videos each week.

She also spends 2 hours a week writing songs. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, she spends:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]
on writing songs each week.

She spends 15 minutes six days a week on makeup. So, she spends:
\[ 15 \times 6 = 90 \text{ minutes} \]
on makeup each week.

Now, let's add up all the time she spends each week:
\[ 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly time by 4:
\[ 282 \times 4 = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
\[ 1128 \div 60 = 18.8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is 18.8 hours. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{18.8 \text{ hours}} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The firm charges $129 to install things like mirrors, shelves, a chandelier, and pictures. They also charge an extra $15 for each new item you want them to install.

Angela wants to have 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed. We know they already have 4 mirrors, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. So, we need to find out how many new items Angela wants to have installed.

- For mirrors: \(6 - 4 = 2\) new mirrors
- For chandeliers: \(2 - 1 = 1\) new chandelier
- For pictures: \(20 - 10 = 10\) new pictures

Now, we calculate the extra cost for these new items:
- Extra cost for mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
- Extra cost for chandeliers: \(1 \times 15 = 15\)
- Extra cost for pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\)

Adding these extra costs together:
- Total extra cost: \(30 + 15 + 150 = 195\)

Now, we add the base cost to the extra cost:
- Total cost: \(129 + 195 = 324\)

So, the total cost for Angela is $324."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate 40% of $30.00, which is 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.
4. So, Roy's total savings are $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Therefore, Roy has saved $42.00."
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Next, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. So, Saskay can lift:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. Then, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, to convert inches to feet, we know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, we divide 480 inches by 12:
\[
480 \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high. The answer is 40 feet."
"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to add the distance he traveled in the first part of his journey to the distance he traveled in the second part.

First, let's calculate the distance for the first part:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance for the second part:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 6 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances from both parts to find the total distance:
- Total Distance = Distance of First Part + Distance of Second Part
- Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step in a simpler way.

If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can find out how long it takes one kangaroo to cross the highway. Since all kangaroos are traveling at the same speed, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos:

\[ \text{Time for one kangaroo} = \frac{18 \text{ hours}}{3} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, imagine we have 4 turtles. Each turtle is moving at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means it will take the turtles twice as long to cover the same distance as a kangaroo. So, if it takes one kangaroo 6 hours, it will take one turtle 12 hours. But since we have 4 turtles, we need to multiply the time by 4:

\[ \text{Time for 4 turtles} = 12 \text{ hours} \times 4 = 48 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 4 turtles 48 hours to cross the highway. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Kora made 20 clay dishes.

Rory made 20 more than Kora, so Rory made:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \text{ clay dishes} \]

Jada made twice as many as Rory, so Jada made:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ clay dishes} \]

Now, to find out how many they all made together, we add up:
\[ 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Erika needs $50 more to buy the laptop. The laptop costs $600, so if she trades in her old laptop, it costs $400. She got $150 from her job and $80 from her mom, which is $230 in total. To find out how much money she has in her purse, we need to subtract the $230 she got from her job and mom from the $50 she still needs.

So, $50 (what she still needs) - $230 (what she got from her job and mom) = $120.

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.

The answer is: **120**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Adam has 3 large apples, and each large apple can be cut into 5 pieces. So, from the large apples, he gets:
\[ 3 \text{ apples} \times 5 \text{ pieces per apple} = 15 \text{ pieces} \]

He also has 5 small apples, and each small apple can be cut into 3 pieces. So, from the small apples, he gets:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} \times 3 \text{ pieces per apple} = 15 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, if he combines all the pieces, he has:
\[ 15 \text{ pieces from large apples} + 15 \text{ pieces from small apples} = 30 \text{ pieces} \]

Adam eats 15 pieces, so the number of pieces left is:
\[ 30 \text{ pieces} - 15 \text{ pieces} = 15 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of apple slices left is 15. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find out how many more cows the farmer needs, let's break it down step by step.

1. The farmer's 3 cows produce 5 liters of milk each day. So, 3 cows produce:
   \[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

2. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day. So, he needs:
   \[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

3. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day. To get 10 liters, he needs:
   \[ \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The answer is 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have three glue sticks, and we need to find out how much glue is left in each one.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. So, the length of the glue left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. So, the length of the glue left is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. So, the length of the glue left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we add up the lengths of the glue left in all three glue sticks:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters.

The correct answer is \boxed{16}."
"Gabriel wants to buy a car that costs $10000 and a phone that costs $800. He has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. First, we need to find out how much money Gabriel has in total. He has $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, we need to find out the total cost of the car and the phone. The car costs $10000 and the phone costs $800, so the total cost is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, we subtract the total amount of money he has from the total cost of the car and the phone. So, $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600. The correct answer is C. $5600."
"Thea bought a hat for $70 and gave the craftsman four $20 bills. To find out how much change she got, we need to do a little math.

First, we calculate the total amount Thea gave:
4 * $20 = $80

Now, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount given:
$80 - $70 = $10

So, Thea got $10 in change. The correct answer is $10."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, so he has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each, so the cost is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, so the cost is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of the squirt guns and water balloons:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total cost from the money he started with:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Craig has 19 dollars left. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so Jack has \(60 \div 2 = 30\) socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \(60 \div 2 = 30\) dishes.
5. Now, let's add up all the items:
   - Jack has \(30\) socks and \(60\) dishes, so \(30 + 60 = 90\) items.
   - Peter has \(60\) socks and \(30\) dishes, so \(60 + 30 = 90\) items.
6. Together, they have \(90 + 90 = 180\) items.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 20 students in total. Out of these, 5 students are good at math only and 8 students are good at English only. We need to find out how many students are good at both math and English.

First, let's add the students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only:
\[ 5 \text{ (math only)} + 8 \text{ (English only)} = 13 \]

This means 13 students are either good at math only, English only, or both. Since there are 20 students in total, the rest must be good at both math and English:
\[ 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English.

Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both math and English:
\[ 5 \text{ (math only)} + 7 \text{ (both)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Vicki's concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. She has a 10-minute intermission, so that leaves 110 minutes for the groups to perform.

Each group has 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to get off the stage. So, the total time for one group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to see how many groups can fit into the 110 minutes:
\[ 110 \div 10 = 11 \]

So, 11 groups can perform in the concert. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest first. The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is \(300 \times \frac{3}{4} = 225\%\). This means for every dollar she invests, she gets 2.25 dollars in interest over a year.

So, for 3 years, the interest she gets is:
\[ 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 300 \times 6.75 = 2025 \]

Now, we add this interest to the original amount to get the total:
\[ 300 + 2025 = 2325 \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have a total of $2325. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts. Half of the white shirts have collars, so:
- Number of white shirts with collars = 40 / 2 = 20
- Number of white shirts without collars = 40 - 20 = 20

For the floral shirts:
- 20 of the floral shirts have buttons.
- So, the number of floral shirts without buttons = 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars:
- Number of floral shirts without buttons = 30
- Number of white shirts without collars = 20

So, the difference is:
30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars. The answer is 10."
"To find out how much the farmer will earn, we first need to know how many trays he has. Since each tray holds 30 eggs and he has 900 eggs, we divide 900 by 30:

\[
900 \div 30 = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Now, if each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
30 \times 2.5 = 75
\]

So, the farmer will earn $75. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{75}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. So, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. The number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, to find out how many goats are left in both farms altogether, we add the remaining goats from both farms:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms is 70. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month. In a year, which has 12 months, he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he spends on each pair, we divide the total amount by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes. The answer is:
\[ 110 \]"
"To find out the total cost, we first calculate the cost of the green food and the red food separately.

- The cost of one basket of green food is $25.
- The cost of one basket of red food is $18, but you get $2 off for each basket, so the cost after discount is $18 - $2 = $16.

Now, we buy 3 baskets of each type of food:
- Cost of 3 baskets of green food = 3 × $25 = $75.
- Cost of 3 baskets of red food = 3 × $16 = $48.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the green food and the red food together:
- Total cost = $75 + $48 = $123.

So, the total amount you have to pay is $123. The correct answer is C. $123."
"To find out how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many rooms are one-half of 90 rooms. That's \(90 \div 2 = 45\) rooms.
2. Now, we know it takes 20 minutes to clean one room. So, for 45 rooms, it would take \(45 \times 20 = 900\) minutes.
3. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 900 minutes into hours. To do this, we divide 900 by 60, which gives us \(900 \div 60 = 15\) hours.

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms. The answer is 15 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
In the second year, they build three times 12 homes, which is 36 homes.
In the third year, they count all the homes built in the first two years (12 + 36 = 48) and then double that number, so they build 96 homes.

Now, to find out how many homes they have built in total over the three years, we add up all the homes:
12 (first year) + 36 (second year) + 96 (third year) = 144 homes.

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years. The answer is 144."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. We know you are three years younger than your brother, so if your brother is \( B \) years old, you are \( B - 3 \) years old.
2. You are also two years older than your sister, so if your sister is \( S \) years old, you are \( S + 2 \) years old.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom is \( 3B - 1 \) years old.
4. The sum of all your ages is 87, so \( B - 3 + B + S + S + 2 + 3B - 1 = 87 \).

Let's simplify the equation:
\[ B - 3 + B + S + S + 2 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 5B + 2S - 2 = 87 \]
\[ 5B + 2S = 89 \]

We also know \( S = B - 5 \) because you are two years older than your sister. Substitute \( S \) in the equation:
\[ 5B + 2(B - 5) = 89 \]
\[ 5B + 2B - 10 = 89 \]
\[ 7B - 10 = 89 \]
\[ 7B = 99 \]
\[ B = 14 \]

Now, we can find your age:
\[ Y = B - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11 \]

So, you are 11 years old. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find out how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first need to know how many glue sticks he needs in total. Since there are 27 students and each student gets 2 glue sticks, we multiply 27 by 2:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of glue sticks he should buy. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks in each pack:

\[ 54 \div 8 = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he wants to have some extra glue sticks left over, he needs to round up to the next whole number. So, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's think through this step by step like we're in primary school.

1. On the first day, the river has 4000 gallons of water.
2. After a day of heavy rain, the water doubles. So, we multiply 4000 by 2:
   \[
   4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. On the third day, the water increases by 6000 gallons. So, we add 6000 to 8000:
   \[
   8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

So, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is 14000 gallons.

The final answer is: 14000 gallons."
"Let's solve this step by step.

We start with 10 people infected. Each day, each infected person infects 6 others.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- So, \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new people get infected.
- Total infected people now: \(10 + 60 = 70\).

**Day 2:**
- Now, there are 70 infected people.
- Each of these 70 people infects 6 others.
- So, \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new people get infected.
- Total infected people now: \(70 + 420 = 490\).

**Day 3:**
- Now, there are 490 infected people.
- Each of these 490 people infects 6 others.
- So, \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new people get infected.
- Total infected people now: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, after three days, the total number of infected people is 3430.

The final answer is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Rafaela got $20 from each of the 40 customers. So, we multiply $20 by 40 to find out how much she got in total:
\[ 20 \times 40 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela. To find out how much 10% of Rafaela's money is, we calculate:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta got $80 less than $800. That means:
\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much money they both got together, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips:
\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money they received as tips altogether is:
\[ \boxed{1520} \]"
"Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so that's 2 oranges × 3 daughters = 6 oranges. Her son got 3 oranges. So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. 

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges.

So, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges. The correct answer is 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. There are 12 months in a year, so Claire earns:
\[ 1 \times 12 = 12 \text{ badges in a year.} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. So, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ badges in a year.} \]

Wendy earns 3 times the number of badges Claire earns in the same time. So, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ badges in a year.} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number Wendy earns:
\[ 36 - 6 = 30 \text{ badges.} \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Paige bakes banana bread from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. That's 5 hours. In one hour, she can bake 2 loaves of banana bread. So, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. So, from 10 loaves, she gets:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. So, the total money she makes is:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 50 \text{ cents/slice} = 4000 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 4000 cents to dollars:
\[ 4000 \text{ cents} \div 100 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Paige raised \(\boxed{40}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The problem also tells us that she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we let the number of silver coins be \( S \), then we can write:
\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find out how many silver coins she has, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins.

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110.

The correct answer is 110."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

George ordered 600 burritos for the picnic. There were 50 students, and each student got 10 burritos. So, we first calculate how many burritos the students got in total:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. So, we add the burritos he ate to the burritos the students got:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

So, the number of leftover burritos is 80. 

The correct answer is: **80**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know the rink has 12 red cars. Now, for the green cars, it says there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. So, we subtract 2 from the number of red cars:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \]
So, there are 10 green cars.

Next, for the blue cars, it says there are 3 times as many blue cars as green cars. So, we multiply the number of green cars by 3:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]
So, there are 30 blue cars.

Now, we add up the red, green, and blue cars:
\[ 12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \]
So, there are 52 cars that are either red, green, or blue.

The rink has a total of 75 cars. To find out how many yellow cars there are, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[ 75 - 52 = 23 \]

So, the number of yellow cars is 23.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that together Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

First, let's say Anne has \( A \) books. Then Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books, and Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is:
\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Subtract 37 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 48 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Now, to find out how many books Fawn has, we add 12 to the number of books Anne has:
\[ 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{28}

"Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. She also bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, so the sweet potatoes weighed 2 times 5 pounds, which is 10 pounds. Then, she bought a bag of carrots that weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weighed 10 pounds minus 3 pounds, which is 7 pounds. 

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots. 

The correct answer is: **7 pounds**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Greg wants to make jello cups for 30 kids, and each kid should have 4 jello cups. So, we need to find out how many jello cups in total:
   \[
   30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups}
   \]

2. We know that one box of jello makes 10 jello cups. To find out how many boxes are needed for 120 jello cups, we divide the total number of jello cups by the number of jello cups one box makes:
   \[
   \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. Each box of jello costs $1.25. To find out the total cost for 12 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:
   \[
   12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello. The answer is $15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The seller bought 5 phones, and each phone cost $700. So, we need to find out the total cost of the 5 phones:

\[ 5 \times 700 = 3500 \]

The seller got $4000 in dollar bills. To find out how much change the seller will get back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the $4000:

\[ 4000 - 3500 = 500 \]

So, the seller will give back $500 in change.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{500}

"To find out how much Keenan spends per week, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 per month.
2. Madeline pays 60% of this amount, so:
   \[
   \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The rest of the money goes to Keenan, so:
   \[
   \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4 to find out how much he spends per week:
   \[
   \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week. The correct answer is 40 dollars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step like I'm explaining it to a primary school student.

Tobias had a big pizza with 60 pieces. He ate some pieces on the first day, then ate 10 more pieces on the second day, and then ate some more on the third day.

1. On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the pizza. To find out how many pieces that is, we do:
   - 2/5 of 60 = (2 × 60) ÷ 5 = 120 ÷ 5 = 24 pieces.
   So, he ate 24 pieces on the first day.

2. After the first day, he had 60 - 24 = 36 pieces left.

3. On the second day, he ate 10 more pieces. So, he ate 10 pieces on the second day.

4. After the second day, he had 36 - 10 = 26 pieces left.

5. On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. To find out how many pieces that is, we do:
   - 7/13 of 26 = (7 × 26) ÷ 13 = 182 ÷ 13 = 14 pieces.
   So, he ate 14 pieces on the third day.

Now, to find out how many pieces he ate in total, we add up all the pieces he ate:
- First day: 24 pieces
- Second day: 10 pieces
- Third day: 14 pieces

So, the total number of pieces he ate is 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

Therefore, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is 48."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for buying soda and water.

First, we find out how much one bottle of soda costs. If 7 bottles cost $21.00, then one bottle costs:
\[ \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]
So, one bottle of soda costs $3.00.

Next, we find out how much one bottle of water costs. If 4 bottles cost $8.00, then one bottle costs:
\[ \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]
So, one bottle of water costs $2.00.

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. The cost for 3 bottles of soda is:
\[ 3 \times 3.00 = 9.00 \]
And the cost for 2 bottles of water is:
\[ 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 \]

Adding these together, the total cost is:
\[ 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."
"To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we first need to calculate the total cost of 16 bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so:

\[
16 \times 0.03 = 0.48
\]

David started with $12.48. After spending $0.48 on the bolts, the money he has left is:

\[
12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00
\]

So, David has $12.00 left. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{12.00}
\]"
"To find out how much Ella earns for 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to know how much she earns per hour. She earned $33 for 3 hours, so we divide $33 by 3 to find her hourly rate.

\[
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \text{ dollars per hour}
\]

Now, to find out how much she earns in 12 hours, we multiply her hourly rate by 12.

\[
\text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 11 \times 12 = 132 \text{ dollars}

"Paul started with 52 marbles and his friend gave him 28 more, so he had 52 + 28 = 80 marbles. Then he lost 1/4 of his marbles, which is 1/4 * 80 = 20 marbles. So, the number of marbles he has left is 80 - 20 = 60 marbles. 

The final answer is 60 marbles."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Amy got 80% of the multiple-choice questions right. There are 10 multiple-choice questions, so she got:
\[ 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \]
questions right.

For the true/false questions, she got 90% right. There are 20 true/false questions, so she got:
\[ 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \]
questions right.

For the long-answer questions, she got 60% right. There are 5 long-answer questions, so she got:
\[ 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \]

Julie sold 14 glasses of lemonade. The total number of glasses sold by Julie, Micah, and Mitchell is 32. So, Micah and Mitchell together sold:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses} \]

Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2:
\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \text{ glasses} \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The answer is:

First, we know Iris spent $400 on her hair.

Next, she spent 1/4 as much on a manicure. To find out how much that is, we do:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent 3/4 as much on a pedicure as she did on the manicure. To find out how much that is, we do:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total amount spent, we add up the cost of the hair, the manicure, and the pedicure:
\[ 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long and she sells it for $2 per meter. So, she gets:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

With $40, she wants to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide $40 by $1.5 per meter:

\[ \frac{40}{1.5} = 26.67 \text{ meters} \]

Since she can only buy whole meters, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[ 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the money left over after buying the new rope is:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the money left over is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, to find out how old she is now, we subtract 10 from 18:
\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]
So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. If her current age is 8, then three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]
This means in the future, Melanie's age will be 24. We already know that in 10 years, she will be 18. So, we need to find out how many more years it will take for her to be 24. We do this by subtracting 18 from 24:
\[ 24 - 18 = 6 \]
So, in 6 more years, Melanie will be 24 years old.

Therefore, the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be three times her present age is 6.

The final answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Kelly has:
- 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. So, each pack of bacon costs $10 ÷ 5 = $2.
- 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. So, each packet of chicken costs $2 × 2 = $4. The total cost for chicken is 6 packets × $4 = $24.
- 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4. So, the total cost for strawberries is 3 packs × $4 = $12.
- 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. So, each pack of apples costs $4 ÷ 2 = $2. The total cost for apples is 7 packs × $2 = $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: $24
- Strawberries: $12
- Apples: $14

Total cost = $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly's budget is $65. So, the money left in her budget is $65 - $60 = $5.

The answer is: $5"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

We know the final concert is twice as long as usual and also has a 15-minute encore. So, the total time for the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's say the usual concert time is \( x \) minutes. Then the final concert time is \( 2x \) minutes. Adding the 15-minute encore, we get:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Now, we need to find out what \( x \) is. First, we subtract 15 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual concert runs for 25 minutes.

The answer is: **25 minutes**"
"Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives some toys to friends. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has left, we need to subtract the toys he gave away from the total he had.

First, let's add up the toys he gave away:
40 (to Alyssa) + 80 (to Bonnie) + 30 (to Nicky) = 150 toys

Now, we subtract the toys given away from the total toys Argo had:
200 (total toys) - 150 (toys given away) = 50 toys

So, Argo has 50 toys left. The correct answer is 50."
"To find out how many chimichangas the shop makes, we need to add up the chimichangas made each day.

- On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
- On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
- On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is 250 chimichangas.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
\[ 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The singer has 50 microphones. He wants to pair them up, but 20% of them won't fit. First, we need to find out how many microphones can't fit. 

20% of 50 is calculated as:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit. That means:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ microphones can fit in pairs.} \]

Now, to find out how many pairs of microphones can be arranged, we divide the 40 microphones by 2:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes. He also sees 2/3 of that number flying overhead. So, we calculate 2/3 of 6:

\[
2/3 \times 6 = 4
\]

So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:

\[
3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Now, we add all the birds together:

\[
6 \text{ (in the bushes)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34.

The final answer is 34."
"Lani baked 55 cookies and ate 5 of them, so she had 50 cookies left. She put these 50 cookies into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide 50 by 5.

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar. The number of cookies in each jar is 10."
"To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the total number of petals on the orchids. Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals:
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of petals on the daisies. Joelle has 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals:
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
\[ 40 \text{ petals (daisies)} - 25 \text{ petals (orchids)} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in her garden. One-fourth of these are indoor plants. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

After removing the indoor plants, we have:

\[ 100 - 25 = 75 \text{ plants left} \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

So, the number of flowering plants is:

\[ 75 - 50 = 25 \]

To find out what percentage of the plants are flowering plants, we use:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of flowering plants is 25%.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to start by figuring out how fast a thingamabob spins. We know that a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob and that it spins at 121 meters per second. So, to find the speed of a thingamabob, we divide 121 meters per second by 11:

\[ 121 \div 11 = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now we know a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second. A whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob, so we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[ 11 \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second. The correct answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half of that, so the yogurt costs $3.

If we add up the cost of the salad and the yogurt, it's $6 + $3 = $9.

Ellen pays a total of $11 for all her food every day. So, the cost of the two carrots must be $11 - $9 = $2.

Since she eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 ÷ 2 = $1.

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1.

The correct answer is: **$1**"
"Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so he works 40 hours in a week. His pay was raised from $10 an hour to $12 an hour.

To find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the number of hours he works by his new hourly wage:
\[ 40 \text{ hours} \times 12 \text{ dollars/hour} = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mark makes $480 a week. The correct answer is:
\[ 480 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she mowed Joe's lawn 6 times because Joe paid her $6 for it. So, if she mowed Joe's lawn 6 times, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times, which is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) times. And she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's lawn, which is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) times.

Now, let's add up all the money she made from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: $6
- Kamala's lawn: $6 \times 3 = $18
- Alba's lawn: $6 \times 5 = $30

So, the total money she made from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \]

Since she made a total of $80, the money she made from selling lemonade is:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

So, the amount she made from lemonade sales is $26.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight:

3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:
   \[ 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:
   \[ 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

So, Harry's weight is 74 kg.

The final answer is: 74 kg."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John rents his car 10 times a month, and each time he rents it for 3 hours. So, in one month, he rents his car for:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

He gets $25 for each hour he rents his car. So, his total earnings in one month are:
\[ 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

John's car payment is $500 a month. To find out how much profit he makes, we subtract his car payment from his earnings:
\[ 750 - 500 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John makes a profit of:
\[ \boxed{250} \text{ dollars} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Martha originally had some notebooks, and we don't know exactly how many, but we know she bought 5 more notebooks and ended up with 7 notebooks in total. So, if we subtract the 5 notebooks she bought from the 7 she has now, we can find out how many she originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Now, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, we multiply the number of notebooks Martha originally had by 3:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Joseph had 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks, so:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

So, the answer is that Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The correct choice is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"On Sunday, Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed 50 + (1/5 * 50) = 50 + 10 = 60 miles. So, the total distance they rowed together is 50 + 60 = 110 miles. 

The total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles. 

So, the final answer is 110 miles."

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Denise and Daniel were reading the same book. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel did yesterday, so she read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today. Daniel didn't read any pages today.

Now, let's add up how many pages each of them read:
- Denise read \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages in total.
- Daniel read \(13\) pages in total.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read:
- \(28 - 13 = 15\)

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The answer is 15."

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

William bought 5 notebooks and each notebook costs $1.50. So, we need to find out how much 5 notebooks cost. We do this by multiplying:

\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

William also bought 1 ballpen and each ballpen costs $0.50. So, we need to find out how much 1 ballpen costs. We do this by multiplying:

\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Now, to find out how much William spent in all, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together:

\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, William spent a total of $8.00.

The final answer is $8.00."
"To find out how much material Jo needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. So, to make 1 small mask, she needs:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} \]

Next, we know that Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. So, to make 1 large mask, she needs:
\[ \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} \]

Now, we need to find out how much material she needs for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

For 20 small masks:
\[ 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards} \]

For 8 large masks:
\[ 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards} \]

Adding these together:
\[ 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards} \]

So, Jo needs \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."

"To find out how much free time Harold has, let's break it down step by step.

1. Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
2. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
3. He also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up all the time he spends on these activities:
- Sleeping: 10 hours
- Working: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

Total time spent = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

A day has 24 hours in total. So, the free time he has is:

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day. The answer is 5."
"Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes. He uses 3 blue shoe boxes, so he has:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ blue shoe boxes left.} \]

He also uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes. So, he uses:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ red shoe boxes.} \]

This means he has:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \text{ red shoe boxes left.} \]

Now, adding the blue and red shoe boxes left, we get:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know Duncan's current age is 60 years. Eight years ago, Duncan was:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \text{ years old} \]

We are told that eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, four years ago, Adam was:
\[ \text{Adam's age four years ago} = \frac{52}{2} = 26 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find out Adam's current age, we add 4 years to his age four years ago:
\[ 26 + 4 = 30 \text{ years old} \]

So, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm. So, first, we need to find out how big Farmer Smith's farm is.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add 100 acres to this:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

So, Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, to find out the total number of acres for both farms together, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

So, the total number of acres for both farms together is 700 acres.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John drinks one bottle of water every half hour. A normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. Since 45 minutes is three half-hours (because 45 divided by 15 equals 3), he drinks 3 bottles of water for the normal Sudoku.

Now, an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal one. So, an extreme Sudoku takes 45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes.

To find out how many half-hours are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30 (since 30 minutes is a half-hour). So, 180 divided by 30 equals 6.

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water for the extreme Sudoku.

The number of bottles of water John drinks in that time is 6."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. We know there are 20 red balloons.

First, we calculate how many pieces of bologna were used for the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the pieces used for the red balloons from the total pieces to find out how many pieces were used for the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow balloons} \]

Since each yellow balloon uses 3 pieces of bologna, we can find out how many yellow balloons there are by dividing the pieces used for yellow balloons by 3:
\[ 18 \text{ pieces} \div 3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many times Jon needs a tune-up, we first calculate the total miles he drives in a month. He drives 100 miles each day for 30 days, so:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Now, since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total miles by 1000 to find out how many tune-ups he needs:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The answer is 3."
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice as many hours as Tuesday, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so that's \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add up all the hours:
\[5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours}\]

So, Bruce works a total of 23 hours over the three days. The final answer is 23."
"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to add up all the money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's add up the cost of everything they bought:
- The cake costs $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, each balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. So, 12 balloons cost 12 * $0.25 = $3.
- They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so 2 tubs cost 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add these costs together:
\[ \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[ \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The correct answer is:

   18 + 38 = 56 \text{ students}
   \]

So, the total number of students is 56. The correct answer is 56."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops were sold in total. There are 30 students, and each student sold 10 lollipops. So, we multiply the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we need to know how much money was made from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8. So, we multiply the total number of lollipops by the price per lollypop:
\[ 300 \times 0.8 = \$240 \]

Now, we need to know how much it cost to buy all these lollipops. Each lollypop cost $0.5. So, we multiply the total number of lollipops by the cost per lollypop:
\[ 300 \times 0.5 = \$150 \]

To find out how much money the class made, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the money made from selling them:
\[ 240 - 150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from selling the lollipops."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits. He has three times as many fish as rabbits, so he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish. He also has 7 gerbils, which is 1/3 the number of fish he has.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

If we count them, we get \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

So, Larry has 47 pets in total. The answer is 47."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

A loaf of bread has 24 slices. Abby can eat 2 slices a day, and Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat:
2 slices (Abby) + 4 slices (Josh) = 6 slices a day.

Now, we need to find out how many days the bread will last if they eat 6 slices a day from a loaf that has 24 slices.

To find the number of days, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together each day:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices per day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days. The answer is 4 days."
"Martha starts collecting shells when she is 5 years old and she collects one shell every month. By the time she is 10 years old, that's 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 5 years is 5 times 12, which is 60 months. So, Martha has collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday. 

The number of shells Martha has collected is:
\[ 60 \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She uses 15 of these cups to make cinnamon tea. So, the remaining cups are:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
These 12 cups are split equally between chamomile and mint tea. So, she makes:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea.

Now, she divides these 27 cups into 3 rows equally. So, each row has:
\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]
cups of tea.

Since the 6 cups of mint tea are split equally between the 3 rows, each row has:
\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]
cups of mint tea.

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. The sloth takes 4 hours to go down to the ground and back up to the tree. So, in 8 hours, he can make 2 trips because 8 hours divided by 4 hours per trip equals 2 trips.

2. He wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he makes 2 trips in 8 hours, we need to find out how many berries he picks up in one trip.

3. To find out how many berries he picks up in one trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips. So, 24 berries divided by 2 trips equals 12 berries per trip.

Therefore, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 12 berries.

The answer is: **12 berries**"
"To find out how much water is left in the tank after 6 days, we start by figuring out how much water is in the tank. The tank has half the amount of water in the pool, so:

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to know how much water is removed from the tank in 6 days. The tank loses 500 gallons of water each day, so in 6 days, it loses:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the amount of water left in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is 2000 gallons. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Colby has $150 to spend on movies. He wants to buy a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) first. So, he spends $8 + $2 = $10 on these.

Now, after buying the popcorn and candy, he has $150 - $10 = $140 left.

On Fridays and Saturdays, a movie ticket costs $10. On other days, it costs $7. Colby has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays and 8 movies on other days. That's a total of 5 + 8 = 13 movies.

Since it's the last day of the month and it's a Friday, he can only see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday. So, he can see 1 more movie.

So, the number of movies he can see is 1.

The answer is: **1**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for mini pastries.

First, we need to find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini one has one-third of that, so:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Similarly, a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini one has one-third of that, so:
\[ \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls:
\[ 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins:
\[ 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries:
\[ 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total calories from all the pastries Andrew baked is 85000 calories. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{85000} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita picks per day, we first need to add up all the Junebugs she picked over the week.

On Monday, she picked 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she picked twice as many as Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also picked twice as many as Monday, so that's another 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she picked 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she picked 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Adding them step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, she picked a total of 299 Junebugs over the week.

To find the average number of Junebugs picked per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[299 \div 5 = 59.8\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs picked per day is 59.8.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the bus and the car.

For the bus:
- The bus travels at 60 miles per hour.
- The bus travels for 5 hours.

To find out how far the bus travels, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

For the car:
- The car travels at 30 miles per hour.
- The car travels for 8 hours.

To find out how far the car travels, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The answer is 60 miles."
"To find out how many bouncy balls Sophie bought, we need to know how many toys she had before and how many she has now.

Sophie had:
- 31 building blocks
- 8 stuffed animals
- 9 stacking rings

So, the total number of toys she had before buying the bouncy balls is:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Now, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, Sophie bought 14 bouncy balls.

The number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the total age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

First, let's say Jean's age is \( J \). Then Paul's age is \( J + 10 \) because Paul is 10 years older than Jean.

Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 \).

Now, we know the total age is 100, so:
\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ J + J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

So Jean is 20 years old. Now we can find Paul's age:
\[ J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

And Peter's age:
\[ 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So Peter is 50 years old.

The answer is: \(\boxed{50}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Maria invited 4 friends, and she gave each of them 2 water balloons. So, that's 4 friends × 2 balloons = 8 balloons.
2. Maria also got 1 water balloon.
3. So, before her mom gave more balloons, they had 8 + 1 = 9 water balloons.
4. Her mom then gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so that's 5 people × 3 balloons = 15 balloons.
5. Adding the balloons before and after, we get 9 + 15 = 24 water balloons.

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is 24. The answer is 24."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total. There are 10 people who each donate 5 boxes, so that's:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

They also have 10 boxes already. So, the total number of boxes is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff. To find out how many tables they need, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes each table can hold:
\[ 60 \div 2 = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

So, they need 15 new tables. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we add the total distances they both spat:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet} = 820 \text{ feet} \]

To find the average, we divide the total distance by 2:
\[ \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet. The answer is \(\boxed{410}\)."
"To find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total number of widgets each machine can make in a month and then find out the total money made from selling those widgets.

First, let's calculate how many widgets each machine makes in a day:
- Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and it works 24 hours a day, so it makes \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets a day.
- WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, and it also works 24 hours a day, so it makes \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets a day.

Next, let's calculate how many widgets each machine makes in a month (30 days):
- Widgeteer 3000 makes \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) widgets in a month.
- WidgetMaster 9000 makes \(1080 \times 30 = 32400\) widgets in a month.

Now, let's find out how much money each machine makes from selling the widgets:
- Widgeteer 3000 makes \(43200 \times 6 = 259200\) dollars.
- WidgetMaster 9000 makes \(32400 \times 6 = 194400\) dollars.

To find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the money made by the WidgetMaster 9000 from the money made by the Widgeteer 3000:
\[259200 - 194400 = 64800\]

So, Fern will make $64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{64800}
\]"
"To find out how much Cameron would save, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the hotel charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. Cameron wants to stay from 5 pm to 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.

If Cameron chooses the 24-hour option, he pays 1600 pesos.

Now, let's look at the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- After 12 hours, he can add 70 pesos for every hour. Since he stays for 17 hours, he adds 5 more hours (17 - 12 = 5).
- So, for the extra 5 hours, he pays 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, to find out how much Cameron saves, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option from the cost of the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

So, Cameron would save 250 pesos.

The correct answer is: **250 pesos**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the goats and sheep.

First, we know each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. If there are 15 goats, then the total hay for the goats is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, each sheep needs:
\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

If there are 12 sheep, then the total hay for the sheep is:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find out how much hay Nate needs in total, we add the hay for the goats and the sheep:
\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{159}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

John earns $50 an hour and works 6 hours. So, his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

After spending $50 on gas, he has:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

He wants to put $100 in the bank, so he has:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each. So, the cost of the pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, he has:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Each pen costs $25, so the number of pens he can buy is:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

So, the number of pens John can buy is 4. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Craig spelled out 20 words, and each word had 15 letters. So, we multiply 20 by 15 to find out how many letters Craig spelled out:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]
So, Craig spelled out 300 letters.

Craig's brother spelled out 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to the 300 letters Craig spelled out:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]
So, Craig's brother spelled out 350 letters.

Now, to find out the total number of letters they both spelled out, we add Craig's letters to his brother's letters:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters they spelled out is 650. The correct answer is 650."
"To find out how many children can be in the drill, we need to calculate it step by step.

1. First, we know there are 8 children in each row.
2. There are 7 rows for each school.
3. There are 5 different schools.

So, we first find out how many children are in one school:
- Children in one school = Number of children in one row × Number of rows for one school
- Children in one school = 8 × 7
- Children in one school = 56

Now, we find out how many children are in all the schools:
- Total children = Children in one school × Number of schools
- Total children = 56 × 5
- Total children = 280

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be used to get 100 bottles of apple juice. So, with all 9 coupons, the teacher gets:

\[ 9 \times 100 = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

There are 29 students in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:

\[ 29 \times 2 = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher got:

\[ 900 - 58 = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{842}
\]"
"To find out how much Patty charged, we need to add up all the costs for the job.

First, we have a fixed visit fee of $40.

Next, we calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, and the cost is $35 per hour. So, we multiply 2.25 by 35:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add the cost of parts, which is $60.

So, the total charge is:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

Therefore, Patty charged **$178.75**."
"James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost of the CDs is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

He gets them for 40% off, so the discount is:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 150 = 0.40 \times 150 = 60 \]

After the discount, the cost of the CDs is:
\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The cost of these 5 CDs is:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]

So, the money he lost from selling these CDs is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money James was out is:
\[ 35 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Jen has different types of root crops to sell. She has 6 yams, 10 sweet potatoes, and 4 carrots. Let's calculate how much money she can make from each type of crop.

First, for the yams:
- She has 6 yams.
- Each yam is sold for $1.5.
- So, the total money from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

Next, for the sweet potatoes:
- She has 10 sweet potatoes.
- Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
- So, the total money from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

Then, for the carrots:
- She has 4 carrots.
- Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
- So, the total money from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

Now, let's add up all the money she can make:
- Total money = Money from yams + Money from sweet potatoes + Money from carrots
- Total money = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

So, if Jen sells all her root crops, she will earn $34. The correct answer is $34."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

James has to swim across a 20-mile lake. He swims 60% of the distance, which is:
\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, so the time it takes him to swim 12 miles is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming 12 miles, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is:
\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Then he swims the remaining distance, which is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

He swims at half the speed, so his speed is:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \]

So, the time it takes him to swim the remaining 8 miles is:
\[ \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the times:
\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had. So, we first find out how many loaves seven times Sam's loaves would be:

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Now, we need to take 40 less than 490:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread.

The final answer is:
\[ 450 \]"
"Jasmine started with 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers, so she had:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers, so she had:

\[ 8 + 5 = 13 \]

So, at the end, Jasmine has 13 stickers. The answer is 13."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Cayley sells newspapers and gets money for each one he sells. He gets different amounts of money for different newspapers.

For the New York Times, he gets 10 cents for each one he sells. He sells 6 of them, so:
10 cents × 6 = 60 cents

For the Wall Street Journal, he gets 8 cents for each one he sells. He sells 10 of them, so:
8 cents × 10 = 80 cents

Now, to find out how much money he gets in total, we add the money from both newspapers:
60 cents + 80 cents = 140 cents

Since 100 cents is the same as 1 dollar, 140 cents is the same as 1 dollar and 40 cents.

So, the total commission Cayley earns is 1 dollar and 40 cents.

The answer is: 1 dollar and 40 cents."
"Okay, let's think through this step by step:

1. We know Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo must be twice as old as Marcus.
4. Therefore, Leo is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.

So, the answer is 42."
"Let's break it down step by step.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar. So, if we let the points Azibo scored be \( A \), then Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points, and Dinar scored \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \) points.

The total points scored by all three is 45. So we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Now, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 3A = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The answer is 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We know that 1 inch of paper has 100 pages because each page is printed on both sides and there are 100 pages in that inch.

Now, the book is 1.5 inches thick. So, if 1 inch has 100 pages, then 1.5 inches will have:
\[ 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \text{ pages} \]

So, the book has 150 pages. 

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Vince starts stapling reports at 8:00 AM and stops at 11:00 PM. That's a long time, isn't it? Let's count the hours:

- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM is 3 hours.
- From 11:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 13 hours.
- So, the total time is 3 hours + 13 hours = 16 hours.

Now, we need to change 16 hours into minutes because Vince can staple reports in 15-minute intervals. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

- 16 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 960 minutes.

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 960 minutes:

- 960 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 64 intervals.

Since he staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by 30:

- 64 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1920 reports.

So, Vince stapled a total of 1920 reports. The answer is 1920."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. We need to convert this to minutes because the other times are given in minutes. 

8 hours = 8 × 60 minutes = 480 minutes.

One day, she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. That's 15 minutes earlier. Also, she sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m., which is 23 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time she was awake:
- From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes.
- 7 hours and 55 minutes = 7 × 60 + 55 = 420 + 55 = 475 minutes.

She was awake for 475 minutes, but she also sleepwalked for 23 minutes and woke up 15 minutes early. So, the total time she was not sleeping is 23 + 15 = 38 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time she was not sleeping from her total sleep time:
- Total sleep time = 480 minutes
- Time not sleeping = 38 minutes
- Actual sleep time = 480 - 38 = 442 minutes.

So, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 442 minutes. The closest option to 442 minutes is 440 minutes.

The answer is \(\boxed{440}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups. Since 1 dozen is 12, 2 dozen is:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]
So, Jonathan has 24 measuring cups.

Jonathan has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, the number of measuring spoons he has is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \]
So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

Jonathan gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so he has:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]
measuring spoons left.

Now, we add the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils:
\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. The hospital has 1000 beds.
2. At first, 1/5 of the beds are taken. So, 1/5 of 1000 is 200 beds are taken.
3. That means 1000 - 200 = 800 beds are empty.
4. Now, 50 new patients are coming in every day. In 2 weeks, which is 14 days, 50 patients will come in 14 times. So, 50 x 14 = 700 new patients will come in.
5. Now, the total number of patients in the hospital will be the initial 200 plus the 700 new patients, which is 200 + 700 = 900 patients.
6. So, the number of empty beds will be the total beds minus the number of patients, which is 1000 - 900 = 100 beds.

The number of empty beds after 2 weeks is 100. So, the answer is 100."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the rest are:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]
emails that are not work emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]
emails.

Now, we subtract the emails sent to her family from the total non-work emails:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]
emails left.

One-third of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]
email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know Aliya is 3 years old. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old. 

The final answer is: **45**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. Kelly said Courtney might have made a mistake and that the number of people was actually 20% less than what Courtney said.

First, we need to find out what 20% of 48 is:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = \frac{20}{100} \times 48 = 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

So, if Courtney overcounted by 9.6, we need to subtract this from the 48 to find the actual number of people:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round this to the nearest whole number. But in this case, the options given are whole numbers, so we look for the closest whole number to 38.4, which is 38.

So, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jason carried 2 balls. According to the problem, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried \(2 \div 2 = 1\) ball.

Now, let's add up all the balls they carried:
- Jeffrey carried 1 ball.
- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jordan carried 4 balls.

So, the total number of balls is \(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\).

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step in a simpler way:

1. On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
2. On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
3. On the third day, they dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes. So, the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

By the end of the third day, the total number of holes they had dug is:
\[10 + 13 + 6 = 29\]

Now, the problem says that by the end of the third day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes. So, four times 10 is:
\[4 \times 10 = 40\]

This means that by the end of the third day, the island had 40 holes. Since they had 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is:
\[40 - 29 = 11\]

So, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. That's 70 + 70 = 140 corn chips for them together.

Collins got 15 more than Amora and Lainey. So, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, to find out the total number of corn chips, we add the chips Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:
140 (Amora and Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225 corn chips.

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"The cost of the supplies is $400. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. To find out how much the travel tickets cost, we first need to calculate 50% of $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than $400. Adding this to the cost of the supplies:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokemon. We also know that:
1. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan.
2. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.
3. The total number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe is 339.

Let's use A for the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught, S for the number Stan has caught, and X for the number Alex has caught.

From the information given:
- \( X = S + 5 \)
- \( S = 4A - 13 \)
- \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, we substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon. To find out how many Stan has caught, we use \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[
S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The number of Pokemon Stan has caught is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Each episode is 20 minutes long. The problem says there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, if each episode is 20 minutes, then the number of episodes is half of 20, which is 10 episodes.

Now, if each episode is 20 minutes and there are 10 episodes, then the total time John will spend watching the show is:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes/episode} \times 10 \text{ episodes} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes. The answer is 200."
"To find the total distance the bird flew, we need to add up the distances of each part of her journey.

1. The bird flew 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, so:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Then, the bird flew 2 hours at 18 miles per hour, so:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flew 5 hours at 22 miles per hour, so:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}
   \]

Now, we add all these distances together:
\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{446}
\]"
"Let's count the brownies step by step.

First, Greta made 1 dozen brownies for herself. Since 1 dozen is 12, she had 12 brownies.

At her office party, she got 1/2 dozen brownies. Since 1/2 dozen is half of 12, she got 6 brownies.

When her friends threw her a surprise party, they gave her 4 dozen brownies. Since 1 dozen is 12, 4 dozen is 4 times 12, which is 48 brownies.

Now, let's add all the brownies together:
12 (from herself) + 6 (from the office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies in total.

During the party, they ate 1 1/2 dozen brownies. Since 1 1/2 dozen is the same as 1.5 dozen, and 1 dozen is 12, 1.5 dozen is 1.5 times 12, which is 18 brownies.

Now, we subtract the brownies eaten from the total:
66 (total brownies) - 18 (brownies eaten) = 48 brownies left.

So, the number of brownies Greta had left over is 48. The correct answer is:

\boxed{48}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Nani's family members.

Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find the total age of all three family members, we add their ages together:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

So, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years. The correct answer is:

30"
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to add up the time for each type of racquet.

First, let's look at the synthetic gut racquets:
- Andy has 3 racquets to string with synthetic gut.
- It takes him 15 minutes to string each one.
- So, for 3 racquets, it will take \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes.

Next, let's look at the polyester string racquets:
- Andy has 5 racquets to string with polyester string.
- It takes him 22 minutes to string each one.
- So, for 5 racquets, it will take \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes.

Finally, let's look at the hybrid sets:
- Andy has 4 racquets to string with a hybrid set.
- It takes him 18 minutes to string each one.
- So, for 4 racquets, it will take \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Time for synthetic gut: 45 minutes
- Time for polyester string: 110 minutes
- Time for hybrid sets: 72 minutes

Adding these together: \(45 + 110 + 72 = 227\) minutes.

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets. The correct answer is 227 minutes."
"John buys phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. So, he needs 4 phones in total. The first two phones cost $600 each, and each of the other two phones costs half of $600, which is $300.

First two phones cost:
\[ 600 + 600 = 1200 \]

The next two phones cost:
\[ 300 + 300 = 600 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, John paid \(\boxed{1800}\) for all the phones."
"To find out how many players are in both teams combined, we start with the number of players in Carlton's team, which is 13. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, so we add 7 to 13 to find out how many players are in Zeke's team.

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players. Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players in both teams together:

\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33. The correct answer is 33."
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we first need to know the total length of the fence. The fence is a rectangle that is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. The total length of the fence is the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

So, we calculate the perimeter:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Now, Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of the fence. So, we multiply the total length of the fence by 2 to find out how many slats he needs:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away 4 boxes in total. That means she kept 12 - 4 = 8 boxes. She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she kept 8 boxes. The rest she sold. The number of boxes she sold is 12 - 8 = 4 boxes. Since each box has 20 oranges, the number of oranges she sold is 4 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges. So, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is 80. The answer is 80."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the USA has 50 states. The problem says India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, let's find out how many states India has.

Half of the USA's states is:
\[ \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, India has 4 more than this number:
\[ 25 + 4 = 29 \]

So, India has 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA and India:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. He has saved $14 from his allowance. He earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to afford his books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The total cost is:
$18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

He has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:
$39 - $14 = $25

Since he earns $5 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work to earn $25 is:
$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I have a primary school education.

1. We have a total of 60 cherries to share.
2. Robert has 30 cherries.
3. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard. So, Richard has \(30 - 10 = 20\) cherries.
4. Now, to find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the cherries Richard and Robert have from the total. So, Jerry has \(60 - 30 - 20 = 10\) cherries.
5. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has. So, Robert has \(30 - 10 = 20\) more cherries than Jerry.

Therefore, the number of cherries Robert has more than Jerry is 20.

The final answer is: **20**"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

On Saturday, Sunny sold:
- 10 boxes of gingerbread
- 6 boxes of apple pie

On Sunday, Sunny sold:
- 15 boxes of gingerbread
- 15 boxes of apple pie

Now, let's add up how many boxes he sold in total:
- Total gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

Next, we calculate the money he made:
- Each box of gingerbread costs $6, so for 25 boxes, he made 25 * $6 = $150
- Each box of apple pie costs $15, so for 21 boxes, he made 21 * $15 = $315

Now, we add the money from both types of pies:
- Total money made: $150 (gingerbread) + $315 (apple pie) = $465

So, Sunny earned $465 in total. The answer is $465."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour she's outside. She plans to be outside for 4 hours each day for 8 days. So, we need to find out how many ounces of sunscreen she will use in total and then how many bottles she needs.

First, let's find out how many hours she will be outside:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Since she uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour, she will use:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"The blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, so it costs 60% of $100.

\[ 60\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.60 \times 100 = \$60 \]

So, the red car costs $60. To find the total cost of both cars, we add the cost of the blue car and the red car together.

\[ \$100 + \$60 = \$160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160. The correct answer is:

\[ \$160 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Emil is 19 years old now. We need to find out how old his dad and his brother are now.

1. When Emil turns 24, he will be 5 years older than he is now.
2. At that time, he will be half the age of his dad. So, if Emil is 24, his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old.
3. Also, at that time, he will be twice the age of his brother. So, if Emil is 24, his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old.
4. Now, we need to find out how old his dad and his brother are now. Since his brother will be 12 when Emil is 24, his brother is currently \(12 - 5 = 7\) years old.
5. And since his dad will be 48 when Emil is 24, his dad is currently \(48 - 5 = 43\) years old.
6. So, the sum of their current ages is \(43 + 7 = 50\).

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 50. The answer is 50."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
2. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
3. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so that's 2 × 20 = 40 beads.

Now, let's add all these beads together:
20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

So, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, so:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up all the crawfish he caught:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Each serving of crawfish is 3 pounds. To find out how many servings he has, we divide the total amount by the amount per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, the number of servings Joe has is 7."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a class of 30 students.

First, we find out how many students are football players. 20% of 30 students are football players:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]
So, 6 students are football players.

Next, we find out how many students are not football players. We subtract the number of football players from the total number of students:
\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]
So, 24 students are not football players.

Now, we need to find out how many of these 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. 25% of the 24 students are cheerleaders or part of the band:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]
So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band.

To find out how many students are leaving early, we add the number of football players to the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band:
\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

So, the number of students leaving early is 12. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes Charlie and Sophie are wearing, we first need to know the size of Charlie's boots. Since Sophie's boots are size 5 and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, Charlie's boots are size 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add the sizes of their boots together and then divide by 2. So, we add 5 and 25 to get 30, and then divide 30 by 2 to get 15.

So, the average size of the shoes they are wearing is 15.

The correct answer is: 15"
"Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long. Each flower plant is 1 foot wide, and there's 1.5 feet space between each plant. Pat already has 17 plants.

First, let's figure out how many plants Pat needs in total. If we put 1 foot of space for each plant, we need 111 feet for the plants themselves. But we also need space between the plants. If we put 1.5 feet between each plant, we need to add this space too.

Let's say Pat needs \( n \) plants. The total space for the plants and the spaces between them is:
\[ n \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ foot/plant} + (n-1) \text{ spaces} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/space} = 111 \text{ feet} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ n + 1.5(n-1) = 111 \]
\[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n = 112.5 \]
\[ n = \frac{112.5}{2.5} \]
\[ n = 45 \]

So, Pat needs 45 plants in total. Since she already has 17 plants, she needs to buy:
\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost is:
\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $168 at the store. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we start by figuring out how many he eats in one day. Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many, we divide 18 by 2:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day. Now, to find out how many he eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in one day by the number of days in a week:

\[ 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week. The correct answer is 63."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for filling one basket first.

Katherine wants to put 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines in each basket. 

The cost of 3 petunias is:
\[ 3 \times \$3.00 = \$9.00 \]

The cost of 2 sweet potato vines is:
\[ 2 \times \$2.50 = \$5.00 \]

So, the total cost for one basket is:
\[ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 \]

Now, since Katherine has 5 baskets, we need to find out how much she will spend for all 5 baskets:
\[ 5 \times \$14.00 = \$70.00 \]

So, Katherine will spend \$70.00 to fill all 5 hanging baskets. 

The final answer is: **\$70.00**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. They use some of it for sunflowers and carnations first.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, they use:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, they use:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total soil used for sunflowers and carnations is:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with 30 pounds, so the soil left for roses is:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so with 3 pounds left, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the number of roses they can plant is 3. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month. She saves 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we need to do some simple math.

First, let's find out how much she saves each month for shoes:
- 25% of $2,000.00 is $500.00.

Now, to find out how much she saves in a year, we multiply the monthly savings by 12 (months in a year):
- $500.00 x 12 = $6,000.00.

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide her yearly savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:
- $6,000.00 ÷ $1,000.00 = 6 pairs.

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The answer is 6."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute, so we divide 90 by 6:

\[ 90 \div 6 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp. The problem tells us she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. So, to sauté 90 shrimp, we need to do:

\[ 90 \div 30 = 3 \]
Then, we multiply by the time it takes for 30 shrimp:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to sauté:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes Emily to peel and sauté 90 shrimp is 45 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step like we're in primary school.

1. The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees every hour when it's on low. It was on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room by:
   \[
   2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]

2. When the air conditioner is on high, it cools the room by 3 degrees every hour. It was on high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room by:
   \[
   3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. When the air conditioner is off, the room warms up by 2 degrees every hour. It was off for 2 hours, so it warmed up the room by:
   \[
   2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the cooling and warming:
- Cooling from low: 6 degrees
- Cooling from high: 12 degrees
- Warming up: 4 degrees

So, the net change in temperature is:
\[
6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}
\]

This means the room is 14 degrees warmer than it was at the start. So, the final temperature is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. Bill saw the comet the next time when he was three times the age his dad was when he saw it. So, Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet the second time.
3. Since the comet comes around every 75 years, Bill must have seen it the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. So, if he was 90 years old the second time, he must have been \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old the first time.

Therefore, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time. The answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Buford writes a check for his electric bill once a month, so that's 12 checks a year. He also writes a check for his gas bill once a month, so that's another 12 checks a year. He writes a check to the church twice a month, so that's 24 checks a year. And he writes a check to the pest and lawn service once every 3 months, so that's 4 checks a year. If we add all these up, we get:

12 (electric bill) + 12 (gas bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52 checks a year.

So, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is 52. The answer is 52."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. So, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane. That means the first plane makes:

\[ 44 \times 2 = 88 \text{ trips in a day} \]

Now, out of these 88 trips, three-quarters of them are to Greece. So, the number of trips to Greece is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \text{ trips} \]

The remaining trips are split equally between France and Germany. Since the total trips are 88 and 66 are to Greece, the remaining trips are:

\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \text{ trips} \]

These 22 trips are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of trips to France is:

\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \text{ trips} \]

But we need to check the options given. The correct number of trips to France is actually 22, not 11. So, the correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for \(20 \times 2 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's add up the total time they howl:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Total time = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 120 seconds to minutes:
- 120 seconds ÷ 60 = 2 minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

The answer is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"Adam spent $30 on new trousers. His mother gave him $6 and his father gave him twice as much as his mother, which is $12. So, his parents gave him a total of $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on trousers, and his parents gave him $18. To find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the money his parents gave him from the cost of the trousers:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To find Wilfred's age, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the total age of all four children is 20 years.
2. Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.
3. So, the total age of Akbar and Alessandro is \(3 + 4 = 7\) years.
4. This means the total age of Helene and Wilfred is \(20 - 7 = 13\) years.
5. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.
6. The average age of the group is \(20 \div 4 = 5\) years.
7. So, Helene is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) years old.
8. If Helene is 10 years old, then Wilfred must be \(13 - 10 = 3\) years old.

Therefore, Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\) years old."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from his online fund. So, he has $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Then, his friend gave him $200. So, the total amount he has now is $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Walter's lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Everyone else has donated $2200, so the lawyer will donate 3 times $2200, which is $6600.

So, the lawyer is going to contribute $6600.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6600}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. There were 100 guests at the wedding, and each guest brought 15 cookies.
2. So, the total number of cookies is \(100 \times 15 = 1500\) cookies.
3. The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door, so \(1500 \div 2 = 750\) cookies were given to the church.
4. Each person in the church got 15 cookies.
5. To find out how many people got cookies, we divide the total cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got: \(750 \div 15 = 50\).

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50. The answer is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To solve this, let's think about the watermelon slices like pieces of a pie.

We have a watermelon that we need to share among 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

If we say each kid gets a slice that is \( x \) part of the watermelon, then each adult gets \( 2x \) part of the watermelon.

So, the total parts of the watermelon are:
- 4 kids getting \( x \) each: \( 4x \)
- 2 adults getting \( 2x \) each: \( 2 \times 2x = 4x \)

Adding these together, the total parts of the watermelon are \( 4x + 4x = 8x \).

This means the whole watermelon is divided into 8 equal parts. Each adult gets 4 parts out of these 8 parts.

To find out what percentage this is, we do:
\[ \frac{4}{8} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The correct answer is: **50%**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Doctor Jones has 9 hours in total for the day.

He spends 3 hours checking on the inpatients. He has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes for each one. So, 9 inpatients times 20 minutes equals 180 minutes, which is 3 hours.

He also has 10 appointments, and each appointment takes 30 minutes. So, 10 appointments times 30 minutes equals 300 minutes, which is 5 hours.

Now, if he spends 3 hours on inpatients and 5 hours on appointments, that's a total of 8 hours.

So, out of the 9 hours, he spends 8 hours on inpatients and appointments. That leaves him with 1 hour to update his records.

The answer is: 1 hour."
"To figure out when Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make and serve the cake.

- Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.
- Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
- Cooling the cake takes 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
- Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.

First, let's add up all these times:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes

Now, we need to convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes. Since 180 minutes is the same as 3 hours, we know it takes 3 hours to make and serve the cake.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find out when she can start, we need to subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm

So, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.

The answer is: 2:00 pm"
"To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to solve the problem step by step.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars.

First, we add the number of boxes sold by Lisa and Peter:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \]

This means they sold 8 boxes in total. Since they sold 64 chocolate bars in these 8 boxes, we can find out how many chocolate bars are in one box by dividing the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in one box.

The number of chocolate bars in a box is:
\[ 8 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The studio rents the studio for $25 each time.
2. For each student, it costs $1.50.
3. With 10 students, the cost for students is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
4. So, the total cost for one session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.
5. The studio rents the studio 3 days a week.
6. In a month, there are about 4 weeks, so the studio rents the studio \(3 \times 4 = 12\) times in a month.
7. Therefore, the total earnings in a month are \(40 \times 12 = 480\) dollars.

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and the total is 64. So, if we divide 64 by 4, we get:
\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \]
So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and the total is 56. So, if we divide 56 by 7, we get:
\[ 56 \div 7 = 8 \]
So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number in each of Peter's boxes:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We start with 50 porcupines in the park.
2. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]
   So, there are 30 female porcupines.
3. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of babies born each month is:
   \[
   30 \times 4 = 120
   \]
4. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:
   \[
   120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]
5. After a year, the total number of porcupines in the park will be the original number plus the babies born:
   \[
   50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much water the pool can hold in cubic feet. The pool is shaped like a big box, and we can find out how much space it has by multiplying its length, width, and depth.

The pool is 25 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 4 feet deep. So, we multiply these numbers together:
\[ 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to know how many gallons of water this is. The pool company said to multiply the cubic feet by 5.9. So we do:
\[ 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we know we need 8260 gallons of water. The pool company charges $0.10 for each gallon. So, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:
\[ 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826. 

The answer is: **$826**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 9 red sticks.
2. There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, we add 5 to the number of red sticks:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
   So, there are 14 blue sticks.
3. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, we subtract 3 from the number of blue sticks:
   \[
   14 - 3 = 11
   \]
   So, there are 11 yellow sticks.
4. Now, we add up all the sticks:
   \[
   9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34
   \]

So, the total number of sticks is 34. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"To find out how many more miles Shandy drove than Matteo, we first calculate the distance each person traveled.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. So, the distance Matteo traveled is:
\[ 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. So, the distance Shandy traveled is:
\[ 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many more miles Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 more miles than Matteo. The answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know the school has 3000 students. Half of them are older than 16 years, so that's 1500 students. Out of these 1500, one-fourth are boys, so that's 375 boys. That means the rest, 1125, are girls who are older than 16.

The other half of the students are younger than 16. So, that's also 1500 students. One-half of these are boys, so that's 750 boys. That means the rest, 750, are girls who are younger than 16.

To find out how many girls are in the school, we add the girls who are older than 16 to the girls who are younger than 16. So, 1125 + 750 = 1875.

Therefore, the total number of female students at the school is 1875.

The answer is: **1875**"
"To find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey runs \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn runs \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn runs \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn runs from the number of laps Bethany runs:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The answer is 5 laps."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

We have a tank that can hold 18000 gallons of water. Wanda and Ms. B are filling the tank over two days.

**Day 1:**
- Wanda fills 1/4 of the tank.
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B fills 3/4 as much as Wanda.
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Total water filled on Day 1:
  \[
  4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
  \]

**Day 2:**
- Wanda fills 2/3 of what she filled on Day 1.
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B fills 1/3 of what she filled on Day 1.
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Total water filled on Day 2:
  \[
  3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}

**Total water filled in two days:**
\[
7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
\]

**Remaining capacity of the tank:**
\[
18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
\]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is **6000 gallons**."
"Let's solve this step by step.

Maria's power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank has:
\[ 100\% - 9\% = 91\% \]
of its original charge left. So, after 5 hours, the power bank is at:
\[ 91\% \]
of its original charge.

Then, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after another 3 hours, the power bank has:
\[ 91\% - 7\% = 84\% \]
of its charge left from the 91% it had after the first 5 hours.

We know that after these 8 hours, the power bank is at 28%. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 84\% \times \text{remaining charge} = 28\% \]

To find the original charge, we need to reverse the calculation. If 84% of the original charge is 28%, then the original charge is:
\[ \text{Original charge} = \frac{28\%}{84\%} \times 100\% = \frac{28}{84} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{3} \times 100\% = 33.33\% \]

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 33.33%.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{33.33\%} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Janet earns $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips. So, she earns a total of $25 an hour. If she works 40 hours a week, her total earnings for the week are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

She wants to save up 20% of $10,000 for a down payment. So, she needs to save:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

So, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Jamaar has $10 to spend. He already bought some fruits and we need to find out how much money he has left to buy plums.

He bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each, so 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- 2 kiwis at $1.0 each, so 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:
$1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

So, he spent $9.25. Now, let's see how much money he has left:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75:
$0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3

Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The answer is 3."
"Anne bought a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

She gave these 13 packs to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend got, we divide the 13 packs by 10 friends:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \]

Since each pack has 60 pieces, each friend got:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for carrots in Mrs. Tatiana's grocery store.

The price of carrots starts at $120 and increases by 5% each year. We need to find the price after 3 years.

First, let's calculate the price after the first year:
- The price increases by 5% of $120.
- 5% of $120 is \( \frac{5}{100} \times 120 = 0.05 \times 120 = 6 \).
- So, the price after the first year is \( 120 + 6 = 126 \).

Next, let's calculate the price after the second year:
- The price increases by 5% of $126.
- 5% of $126 is \( \frac{5}{100} \times 126 = 0.05 \times 126 = 6.30 \).
- So, the price after the second year is \( 126 + 6.30 = 132.30 \).

Now, let's calculate the price after the third year:
- The price increases by 5% of $132.30.
- 5% of $132.30 is \( \frac{5}{100} \times 132.30 = 0.05 \times 132.30 = 6.615 \).
- So, the price after the third year is \( 132.30 + 6.615 = 138.915 \).

Rounding $138.915 to the nearest integer, we get $139.

So, the price of carrots after three years is $139."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Olivia uploaded 72 pictures into 8 albums. She put the same number of pictures into each album. So, each album has:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Now, we know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. So, the total number of pictures in selfies and portraits is:
\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} + 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]
\[ = 27 + 18 \]
\[ = 45 \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is 45. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we first need to know how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can find out how many minutes it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages. So, it takes him \( \frac{10}{3} \) minutes to read one page.

Now, if he reads 18 pages, we multiply the time it takes to read one page by 18. That means \( 18 \times \frac{10}{3} \) minutes. Simplifying this, we get \( 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \) minutes.

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The answer is 60 minutes."
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early. So, we subtract 24 from 100:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. 15 guests checked out late. So, we subtract 15 from 76:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late. Since 15 checked out late, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, we add 30 to 61:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in. So, we add 7 to 91:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98
   \]

So, the hotel now has 98 guests.

The final answer is 98."
"To find out how many bananas John has, we need to add up the bananas he picks each day.

- On Wednesday, he picks 4 bananas.
- On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
- On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add the bananas from each day:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

So, John has 22 bananas in total. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

We have a quiz with 60 questions in total.

1. **Easy questions**: 40% of 60 is 24 questions.
2. Aries is sure to get 75% of these easy questions correct. So, she gets \(75\%\) of 24 questions right:
   \[
   75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18
   \]
3. **Average and difficult questions**: The rest are equally divided into average and difficult questions. So, we have:
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 60 = 36 \text{ questions}
   \]
   Since they are equally divided, we have:
   \[
   \text{Average questions} = \text{Difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ questions each}
   \]
4. Aries is sure to get half of these average and difficult questions correct. So, she gets \(50\%\) of 18 questions right:
   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 18 = 0.50 \times 18 = 9
   \]
5. Now, we add up all the questions Aries is sure to get right:
   \[
   18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36
   \]

So, Aries is sure to get \(\boxed{36}\) points."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. Today, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned a total of $120.

First, let's find out how much money Teresa made from selling large stuffed animals. If she sold twice as many small ones as large ones, and the total earnings are $120, we can figure out how much she made from the large ones.

If she sold 6 large stuffed animals, each at $12, then:
\[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \]
So, she made $72 from the large stuffed animals.

Now, to find out how much she made from the small ones, we subtract the $72 from the total $120:
\[ 120 - 72 = 48 \]
So, she made $48 from the small stuffed animals.

Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, we can find out how many small ones she sold by dividing the total money from small ones by the price of one small one:
\[ 48 \div 4 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to know how many sandwiches they eat in a day.

- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is:
\[5 + 4 + 2 = 11\]

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week (7 days), we multiply the number of sandwiches they eat in one day by 7:
\[11 \times 7 = 77\]

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week. The correct answer is 77."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Suzanne sold cookies and cupcakes and then gave some money to her sisters. Here's how we can figure out how much money she has left:

1. She sold 80 cookies at $1 each:
   \[ 80 \times 1 = 80 \]
   So, she got $80 from cookies.

2. She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each:
   \[ 60 \times 4 = 240 \]
   So, she got $240 from cupcakes.

3. Now, let's add the money from cookies and cupcakes:
   \[ 80 + 240 = 320 \]
   So, she got a total of $320.

4. She gave $10 to each of her two sisters:
   \[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \]
   So, she gave away $20 to her sisters.

5. Now, let's subtract the money she gave to her sisters from her total earnings:
   \[ 320 - 20 = 300 \]

So, Suzanne has $300 left. The correct answer is $300."
"The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 60 eggs. That leaves 40 eggs for the rest of the friends to find. But 10 of those eggs were not found by the friends. So, the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

The number of eggs the friends found is 30. 

So, the final answer is 30."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way:

1. A dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. A dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine twice as much as an iron pickaxe dwarf, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. A dwarf with a steel pickaxe can also mine 50% more than an iron pickaxe dwarf. So, \(24 + (0.5 \times 24) = 24 + 12 = 36\) pounds per day.
4. Now, if we have 40 dwarves all mining with steel pickaxes, they can mine \(40 \times 36 = 1440\) pounds of ore per day.
5. In a month with 30 days, they can mine \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) pounds of ore.

So, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month is 43200 pounds. 

The correct answer is: **43200 pounds**."
"To find out how much the package with 8 sandwiches costs, we need to use the information that the prices are the same for the same number of sandwiches.

First, let's look at the first package:
- It has 2 sandwiches for $3.
- So, each sandwich costs $3 ÷ 2 = $1.5.

Next, let's look at the second package:
- It has 4 sandwiches for $6.
- So, each sandwich costs $6 ÷ 4 = $1.5.

Since the prices are the same for the same number of sandwiches, we can use the price per sandwich to find the cost of the third package:
- The third package has 8 sandwiches.
- So, the cost will be 8 sandwiches × $1.5 per sandwich = $12.

Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \boxed{12} dollars."
"Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that money to pay part of the new bedroom set. So, the new bedroom set costs him $3000 - $1000 = $2000. He has to pay 10% of $2000 each month. To find out how much he pays each month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = \frac{10}{100} \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Sally starts with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.
2. A gust of wind bursts 40% of the red balloons. So, 40% of 25 red balloons burst:
   \[
   0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst}
   \]
   This means the number of red balloons left is:
   \[
   25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons}
   \]
3. Sally then accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons. So, half of 12 yellow balloons are released:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released}
   \]
   This means the number of yellow balloons left is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons}
   \]
4. Sally finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her collection. So, 75% of 8 blue balloons are added:
   \[
   0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added}
   \]
5. Now, we add up all the balloons Sally has left:
   \[
   15 \text{ red} + 7 \text{ green} + 6 \text{ yellow} + 6 \text{ blue} = 34 \text{ balloons}
   \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 34. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}
\]"
"To figure out the chance that Marcus has to turn in his homework, we need to look at all the different ways he might not have to turn it in.

1. There's a 50% chance he'll have a substitute teacher. If he has a substitute teacher, he doesn't have to turn in his homework.
2. If the normal teacher comes, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, 60% of the time, he doesn't get an extension and has to turn in his homework.
3. Even if he doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance he can convince the teacher his dog ate his homework and get a personal extension. So, 80% of the time, he still has to turn in his homework.

Now, let's add up the chances he doesn't have to turn in his homework:
- 50% chance with a substitute teacher
- 60% chance with the normal teacher (since 40% get an extension, 60% don't)

So, the total chance he doesn't have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 50\% + 60\% = 110\% \]

But since probabilities can't be more than 100%, we need to adjust. The 110% means he has a 100% chance of not having to turn it in because the 50% chance of a substitute teacher and the 60% chance of not getting an extension add up to 100%.

Therefore, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework is:
\[ 100\% - 100\% = 0\% \]

So, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To find out how many tickets each graduate gets, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we add up the seats for graduates and faculty:
   - Seats for graduates: 950
   - Seats for faculty: 300
   - Total seats accounted for: 950 + 300 = 1250

2. Now, we subtract the seats accounted for from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center:
   - Total capacity: 6000
   - Remaining seats: 6000 - 1250 = 4750

3. Finally, we divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate gets:
   - Number of graduates: 950
   - Tickets per graduate: 4750 ÷ 950 = 5

So, each graduate gets 5 tickets. The answer is 5."
"To find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat, let's break it down step by step:

1. Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
2. He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, he can eat \(2 \times 75 = 150\) medium-sized beans.
3. Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans are in 150 medium-sized beans, we multiply 150 by 3.

So, \(150 \times 3 = 450\) small beans.

Therefore, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is 450. The correct answer is 450."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she spends:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

She gets paid $15 each day for 3 days, so her total pay is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

She also has to pay $3 each day for parking for 3 days, so her total parking cost is:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

So, her net pay after expenses is:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much she gets paid per hour, we divide her net pay by the total hours she worked:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes 2 dollars per hour after expenses. The answer is 2 dollars per hour."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Ted starts with $200. He buys 3 books, and each book costs $16. So, the total cost for the books is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, he buys 3 pencils, and each pencil costs $6. So, the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much he spent in total, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Ted spent a total of $66. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"Richard wants to make a video of a science experiment where he drops a specific branded candy into a bottle of diet soda every 3 feet along his driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, so he needs to place a bottle every 3 feet. That means he needs 8 bottles (1 at the start, 1 every 3 feet until the end).

To set off each bottle, it takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next and drop the candy. Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle, he has to go through 7 intervals (from the first to the second, second to the third, and so on, until the seventh to the eighth).

So, the total time is 7 intervals times 5 seconds per interval, which equals 35 seconds.

The total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is **35 seconds**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Uncle Franky has two boxes of apples. Each box has 40 apples. So, if we add the apples from both boxes, we get:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} + 40 \text{ apples/box} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Now, Uncle Franky wants to pack these apples into packs of 8 apples each. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound. So, the cost for Parmesan cheese is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 11 \text{ dollars/pound} = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, she buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound. So, the cost for mozzarella cheese is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add the cost of both cheeses:
\[ 22 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from her initial amount:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Amor will have \(\boxed{10}\) dollars left to buy meat."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Jim borrowed $50,000 each year for 4 years, so he borrowed a total of:
\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Before college, Jim had a job that paid $25,000 a year. After college, his job paid three times as much, so it paid:
\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

If Jim worked for 8 years (4 years in college and 4 years after college), he would have earned:
\[ 75,000 \times 8 = 600,000 \]

But he also borrowed $200,000 during his college years, so he needs to earn back the $200,000 he borrowed. That means he needs to earn:
\[ 600,000 - 200,000 = 400,000 \]

To earn $400,000 at his new job that pays $75,000 a year, it would take him:
\[ \frac{400,000}{75,000} = \frac{400}{75} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \]

Since Jim can't work a fraction of a year, he needs to work for 6 years to earn enough money.

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first figure out the size of each piece of fabric. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, each piece of fabric will be:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Now, to find the area of one piece of fabric, we multiply the length by the width:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, Jim needs to buy \(\boxed{160}\) square feet of fabric."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

On Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters.

On Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's letters. To find one-fifth of Monday's letters:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85 \]
Then add 17:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]
So, on Tuesday, they delivered 102 letters.

On Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice Tuesday's letters. First, find twice Tuesday's letters:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]
Then add 5:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]
So, on Wednesday, they delivered 209 letters.

Now, to find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the letters from each day:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736.

The final answer is \(\boxed{736}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the chicken salad and pasta salad.

First, we calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- 10 people want chicken salad.
- Each person's chicken salad costs $6.50.
- So, the total cost for chicken salad is \(10 \times 6.50 = 65\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- 6 people want pasta salad.
- Each person's pasta salad costs $6.
- So, the total cost for pasta salad is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) dollars.

Now, we add the two costs together to find the total amount Molly will pay:
- Total cost for chicken salad: $65
- Total cost for pasta salad: $36
- Total amount: \(65 + 36 = 101\) dollars.

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is \(\boxed{101}\) dollars."
"Let's break down the problem step by step in a simpler way.

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Twice the amount lost in the first race: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   So, Johnny's dad won $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race: $11
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)
   So, Johnny's dad lost $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's add up the total amount lost:
- Amount lost in the first race: $5
- Amount lost in the third race: $16.5
- Total amount lost: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average amount lost per race: \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667\)

So, the average amount lost per race is $7.1667.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.1667}
\]"
"To find out how many people live in South America, we need to do a few simple steps:

1. First, we know there are 26 countries in South America.
2. Each of these countries has 5 cities.
3. Each city has 1000 people living in it.

So, to find the total number of cities in South America, we multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Now, to find the total number of people, we multiply the number of cities by the number of people in each city:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier, let's start by converting everything to inches for easier calculation.

Xavier was 4 feet tall. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, Xavier's height in inches is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 + 3 = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 + 2 = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find out how much taller Cole is than Xavier, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height:
\[ 52 - 51 = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, Cole is 1 inch taller than Xavier. The difference in their heights is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have three people dividing $1920. Let's say the first person took \( x \) dollars. The second person took $80 more than the first person, so they took \( x + 80 \) dollars. The third person took twice what the second person took, so they took \( 2(x + 80) \) dollars.

The total amount they took together is $1920. So we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Now, let's simplify the left side:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, we subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person took $420. 

The answer is: **420**"
"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to follow these steps:

First, we calculate the total number of days the painters worked. They worked for 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days. So, 3 weeks is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Next, we know they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. So, the total number of days they worked is:
\[ 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to find out how many hours they worked in total. Since there are 24 hours in a day, the total number of hours worked is:
\[ 7.875 \times 24 = 190.5 \text{ hours} \]

There are 4 painters, so the number of hours each painter worked is:
\[ \frac{190.5}{4} = 47.625 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter worked 47.625 hours. The answer is:
\[ 47.625 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. We also know that in the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, and in the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set.

Let's say the second set had \( x \) balls. Then the first set had \( x + 4 \) balls, and the third set had \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

So, the total number of balls is:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To make it easier, let's convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[ 2x = \frac{4x}{2} \]
\[ \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]
\[ \frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 15 \]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, the second set had 6 balls. Now, for the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the year 2010.

In 2007, the car cost $20,000. It loses 21% of its value each year, so it keeps 79% of its value each year.

1. In 2008, the car's value is:
   \[
   20000 \times 0.79 = 15800
   \]

2. In 2009, the car's value is:
   \[
   15800 \times 0.79 = 12522
   \]

3. In 2010, the car's value is:
   \[
   12522 \times 0.79 = 9830.18
   \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is $9830.18.

The closest option to $9830.18 is $9800.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9800}
\]"
"To find out how many Spanish books there are, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know there are 50 books in total.
2. Half of these books are in English. So, we calculate half of 50:
   \[
   \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]
   So, there are 25 English books.
3. Next, we know that 10% of the books are in German. To find out how many that is, we calculate 10% of 50:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{10}{100} \times 50 = 5
   \]
   So, there are 5 German books.
4. Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
   \[
   50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]
   So, there are 20 Spanish books.

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is 20."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we start by noting the total distance from San Diego to New York City is about 1955 kilometers. Bernice has already driven 325 kilometers.

So, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance:
\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

The correct answer is 1630 kilometers."
"To find out how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we first need to know how many cups she drinks in total. She drinks 8 cups every day, so in 30 days, she drinks:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we know that 16 cups make up 1 gallon. So, to find out how many gallons 240 cups make, we divide:

\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days. The answer is 15 gallons."
"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people get off the train. Twice that number, which is 100 people, get on the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people get off the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]
   So, there are 110 people on the train at the final stop.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"Alison bought a tank top for $10, running shorts for $5 more than the tank top, so that's $10 + $5 = $15. She also bought tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so that's $48 / 2 = $24. And she bought a pair of athletic socks for $8 with a $2 off coupon, so that's $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

So, the total cost is $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55.

Therefore, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear. The correct answer is $55."
"To find out how much it will cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to figure out how many tiles we need and then multiply that by the cost of each tile.

The kitchen floor is 200 square feet big, and each tile is 1 square foot because it's a square tile with each side being 1 foot. So, we need 200 tiles to cover the whole floor.

Each tile costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400.

The final answer is $2400."
"To find out how much James pays for insurance in a year, we first need to know how much more the insurance costs because of the accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, and it's 60% more than that.

First, let's find out how much more the insurance costs:
- 60% of $120 is calculated as \(120 \times 0.60 = 72\).

So, the cost of the insurance with the accident is $120 (normal cost) + $72 (extra cost) = $192 a month.

Now, to find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
- $192 a month times 12 months equals $2304.

So, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance.

The final answer is: **$2304**."
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

Greg needs to wash sheets for:
- 4 twin beds, and each load can wash 2 twin sets, so that's 4 / 2 = 2 loads for the twin beds.
- 1 king size bed, and each load can wash 1 king set, so that's 1 load for the king bed.

So, in total, he needs to do 2 loads for the twin beds + 1 load for the king bed = 3 loads of laundry per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 3 loads/week × 52 weeks/year = 156 loads of laundry in a year.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{156}
\]"
"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step:

1. They watch 4 movies on Saturday.
2. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, so they watch \(4 \div 2 = 2\) movies on Sunday.
3. In one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch \(4 + 2 = 6\) movies.
4. Since there are 4 weekends in 4 weeks, they watch \(6 \times 4 = 24\) movies in 4 weeks.

So, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 24. The answer is 24."
"Let's break it down step by step:

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers.

Last year, he collected 50 more stickers. So, before last year, he had:
\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \]
stickers.

This year, he collected twice the number of stickers he collected last year. Since he collected 50 stickers last year, this year he collected:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]
stickers.

Now, let's add up all the stickers he has now:
- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 50 stickers
- This year: 100 stickers

So, the total number of stickers Leo has now is:
\[ 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 \]

Therefore, the total number of stickers Leo has in his collection is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we first need to know how much cat food the cats eat in one day.

- Imma has 3 cats.
- Each cat gets 60 grams of food twice a day, so each cat eats \(60 \times 2 = 120\) grams of food per day.
- So, 3 cats eat \(120 \times 3 = 360\) grams of food per day.

Now, we need to see how many days 720 grams of food will last for these 3 cats. We do this by dividing the total amount of food by the amount the cats eat in one day:

\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days. The answer is 2 days."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Becky ate 10 slices. Jake ate 3 slices less than Becky, so:
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we add up all the slices they ate:
\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know Donovan's part took some time, let's call this time \( D \) minutes. Betsy's part took 18 minutes more than Donovan's part, so it took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time for both parts is 98 minutes. So, we can write the equation:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Now, Betsy's part took 18 minutes more than Donovan's part, which is:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The answer is \(\boxed{58}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out the total cost of the doctor's visit.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300 for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The doctor charges $4 for each painkiller and there are 30 painkillers, so:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. The doctor charges $6 for parking for 2 hours, so:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

James gets 80 emails a day. Out of these, 20% don't need a response. So, we first find out how many emails do need a response.

1. Calculate 20% of 80 emails:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{20}{100} \times 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16 \text{ emails}
   \]
   So, 16 emails don't need a response.

2. Now, subtract the emails that don't need a response from the total emails to find out how many do need a response:
   \[
   80 - 16 = 64 \text{ emails}
   \]
   So, 64 emails need a response each day.

3. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails that need a response each day by 5:
   \[
   64 \times 5 = 320 \text{ emails}
   \]

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week. The answer is 320."
"To find out how many classes visited the Science Center last week, let's add up the number of classes for each day:

- Monday: 32 classes
- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, so \(32 \times 2 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, so \(32 \times 3 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, let's add these numbers together:
\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

First, add 32 and 64:
\[32 + 64 = 96\]

Next, add 96 to 96:
\[96 + 96 = 192\]

Then, add 192 and 30:
\[192 + 30 = 222\]

Finally, add 222 and 25:
\[222 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests he took.

First, let's add up all his scores:
- He scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so that's 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.
- He scored 80 on his 4th test.

Now, let's add the score from the 4th test to the previous total:
- 300 + 80 = 380

John took 4 tests in total. To find the average, we divide the total score by the number of tests:
- 380 ÷ 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95. The correct answer is 95."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. So, they ate:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]
That means they have:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas left} \]

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas} \]
They ate 80% of their pizzas, so they ate:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \text{ pizzas} \]
That means they have:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas left} \]

Now, to find out how many pizzas are left in total, we add the pizzas left by both groups:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the number of pizzas left is 14."
"Anthony wants to send 700 small coupons and 1400 big coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and each big coupon costs 15 cents.

First, let's find out how much it costs to mail all the small coupons:
- He sends 700 small coupons.
- Each small coupon costs 5 cents.
- So, the total cost for small coupons is \(700 \times 5 = 3500\) cents.

Next, let's find out how much it costs to mail all the big coupons:
- He sends 1400 big coupons.
- Each big coupon costs 15 cents.
- So, the total cost for big coupons is \(1400 \times 15 = 21000\) cents.

Now, let's add the cost of mailing the small and big coupons together:
- Total cost = \(3500 + 21000 = 24500\) cents.

To convert cents to dollars, we know that 100 cents make 1 dollar. So, \(24500\) cents is \(24500 \div 100 = 245\) dollars.

So, Anthony spends \(\boxed{245}\) dollars on postage."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So, Sidney ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches left.
3. Then, Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches. So, Sidney now has 3 + 3 = 6 meatball sub sandwiches.
4. Each meatball sub sandwich has 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the 6 meatball sub sandwiches is 6 × 4 = 24 meatballs.

Therefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24."

Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser. But two hours after they left, 5 trucks had problems and couldn't deliver. So, the number of trucks that could deliver is:

20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks

Each of these 15 trucks carried 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

15 trucks × 20 tons per truck = 300 tons

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons. The answer is 300."
"Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants. The store has a promotion where you get 1 pound of butter for half off if you buy 2 pounds. The butter costs $4.00 a pound.

First, Dennis needs to buy 2 pounds of butter to get the promotion. For 2 pounds, he pays:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

But he gets 1 pound for free. So, for \$8.00, he gets 2 pounds of butter.

To get 6 pounds, Dennis needs to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds:
\[ 3 \times \$8.00 = \$24.00 \]

So, the total cost for Dennis to get 6 pounds of butter is \$24.00.

The correct answer is: **\$24.00**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \text{ guests} \]

But 4 people couldn't come, so the number of guests who will come is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \text{ guests} \]

The theater rental fee is $125 for the first 20 guests. For the extra guests, there's an extra $6 for each guest. So, for the 21 extra guests, the cost is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the base fee to the extra fee:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the party is $251."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Maggie had $60 and she spent a quarter of it. A quarter of $60 is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas. He needs these bananas to feed his three monkeys for a week. 

One monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So, in a week, the first monkey eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day. So, the second monkey eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we add the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week:
\[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

So, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas in a week:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the third monkey eats these 147 bananas in 7 days, we find out how many bananas he eats each day:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."

Jenny had five $5 bills, so she had:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

To pay for the roses, she needs:

\[ 30 - 25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the florist gives change in quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters she gets is:

\[ \frac{5}{0.25} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny leaves with 20 quarters. The correct answer is:

"Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so she has saved 120 toothpicks. She needs 200 toothpicks in total. To find out how many more toothpicks she needs, we subtract the number of toothpicks she has from the total number she needs:

\[ 200 - 120 = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks she still needs by the number of toothpicks she saves each week:

\[ 80 \div 10 = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the 200 toothpicks. The answer is:

4. Now, to find out the discount percentage, we need to see how much less the friend paid compared to the original price. The difference is:
   \[
   2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]
5. The discount percentage is:
   \[
   \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\%

So, the percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got from the original price is 10%.

The answer is: \boxed{10\%}"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step:

1. We know that one spring makes one jellyfish every second.
2. In one hour, there are 3600 seconds (60 seconds per minute and 60 minutes per hour).
3. So, in one hour, one spring makes 3600 jellyfish.
4. Now, we want to know how many jellyfish 5 springs can make in 4 hours.
5. First, let's find out how many jellyfish one spring makes in 4 hours. Since one spring makes 3600 jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours it will make \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.
6. Now, if one spring makes 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours, then 5 springs will make \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

So, the number of jellyfish 5 springs can make in 4 hours is 72000. The answer is \(\boxed{72000}\)."

We know Binkie's score is 90. Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. So, we first find out what twice Binkie's score is:

\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, we add 15 to that to get Frankie's score:

\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195.

The final answer is:
\[ 195 \]"
"James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then he had to walk back home, another 2 miles. So he walked a total of 4 miles. If he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, the time it took him to walk 4 miles is:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the store. The answer is 1 hour."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, she gets a total of:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, if she buys the bananas individually at $0.80 each, the total cost would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

But if she buys the bananas in bunches, each bunch costs $3.00, so for 10 bunches, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money she saves, we subtract the cost of buying in bunches from the cost of buying individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saves:
\[ \boxed{2} \] dollars."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. If we let the amount of fence Sam gets be \( S \) feet, then Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet.

The total fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get:
\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount left over for Sam is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to know how much it grows in one year. If the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, then in one year it grows:

\[ \text{Growth per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now, to find out how much it grows in 13 years, we multiply the growth per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so:
\[ \text{Number of Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

15% of the bikes were BMX bikes, so:
\[ \text{Number of BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45 \]

The rest were MTB bikes:
\[ \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 \]

Now, let's find out how much money Marcel made from each type of bike:
- Each Trekking bike costs $450, so:
\[ \text{Money from Trekking bikes} = 150 \times 450 = 67500 \]

- Each BMX bike costs half the price of an MTB bike, which is $250, so:
\[ \text{Money from BMX bikes} = 45 \times 250 = 11250 \]

- Each MTB bike costs $500, so:
\[ \text{Money from MTB bikes} = 105 \times 500 = 52500 \]

Now, let's add up all the money Marcel made:
\[ \text{Total money} = 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250 \]

So, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. So in 6 hours, the farmer makes:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. So in 6 hours, the truck picks up:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, to find out how many bales are left, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is 12.

The answer is: **12**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. **Number of periods John takes each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - So, John takes \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Time spent in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Time spent in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - First, find the total weekly minutes:
     \[
     1600 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Then, calculate the extra learning time:
     \[
     \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Total time spent learning each week:**
   - Total time in class each week: 1600 minutes.
   - Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday: 100 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is:
     \[
     1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning in hours is:
     \[
     \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning. The closest option to 28.33 hours is 28 hours.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{28}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. So, the ball starts at 72 feet high because:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ feet} \]

When the ball bounces, it goes up to 2/3 of its height. So, after the first bounce, the ball goes up to:
\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Now, the ball bounces again, and it goes up to 2/3 of 48 feet:
\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the ball goes up to 32 feet on its second bounce. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
   \[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child:
   \[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child:
   \[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child:
   \[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

So, the fourth child is 72 inches tall. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to figure out how many bags of apples they sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. So, we can find out how many bags they sold by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples in each bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. So, to find out the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000. The answer is:

1000"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the triceratops, so the other half was left.
2. The velociraptors then ate half of what was left, so they left half of the half, which is a quarter.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which is the quarter of the meat.

So, if 270 kilograms is a quarter, then the whole was four times that. Let's calculate:

\[
270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the Tyrannosaurus rex ate.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1080}
\]"
"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total area of the walls. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two such walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 40 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we add the areas of all the walls together to get the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how many gallons of paint are needed. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. Ellen starts with 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them and leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken.
2. Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.
3. Ellen's friend now has to choose 1 soda from the 4 sodas left (2 shaken and 2 unshaken).

To find out the chance that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda, we look at how many shaken sodas are left and how many sodas in total are left.

- Number of shaken sodas left: 2
- Total number of sodas left: 4

The chance is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, which is 2 out of 4. This can be simplified to 1 out of 2, or 50%.

So, the chance that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is 50%.

The answer is: **50%**"
"To find out how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then add those distances together.

1. The first train travels at 60 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. The second train travels at half the speed of the first train, so it travels at 30 miles per hour. In 3 hours, it will travel:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each has traveled:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles}
   \]

So, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 270 miles. The correct answer is 270 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

First, we need to find out how many days are from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days, so that's 31 + 19 = 50 days in total.

Billy takes 20% of these days off, so he works 80% of the days. That means he works 80% of 50 days, which is 50 * 0.80 = 40 days.

Billy works 3 hours each day, so in 40 days, he works 40 * 3 = 120 hours.

Billy can help 2 people in one hour, so in 120 hours, he helps 120 * 2 = 240 people.

So, the number of people Billy helps is 240. The answer is 240."
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.

So, the total number of people in the buses is:
\[ 12 \times 35 = 420 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.

So, the total number of people in the cars is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Now, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 + 60 = 480 \]

So, the total number of people inside the church is 480.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Mike is 24 years old. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we can find out Martha's age by subtracting 4 from 24. 

\[ 24 - 4 = 20 \]

So, Martha is 20 years old. Now, Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age.

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old. The answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest slide:
- The biggest slide is 300 feet long.
- People slide down at 60 feet per minute.

To find the time, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:
\[
\text{Time for the biggest slide} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest slide:
- The second biggest slide is 240 feet long.
- People slide down at 80 feet per minute.

To find the time, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:
\[
\text{Time for the second biggest slide} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time:
\[
\text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. The answer is 2 minutes."
"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many minutes Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks in one day.
   - His lunch is 30 minutes.
   - He has 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.
   - So, in one day, he spends 30 + 30 = 60 minutes on his lunch and breaks.

2. Now, we need to find out how many minutes he spends on his lunch and breaks in 5 days.
   - In one day, he spends 60 minutes.
   - So, in 5 days, he spends 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.

3. Finally, we need to convert the total minutes into hours.
   - There are 60 minutes in one hour.
   - So, 300 minutes is 300 / 60 = 5 hours.

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Ahito.

We know the total miles run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so:

\[ 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:

\[ 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step like I'm explaining it to a primary school student.

1. Sheila starts with $85.00 on her credit card.
2. She returns an item that cost $15.00. So, we subtract $15.00 from $85.00:
   \[ 85 - 15 = 70 \]
   Now, Sheila's credit card balance is $70.00.

3. Next, she buys a frying pan that is 20% off $20.00. To find out how much she pays for the frying pan, we calculate 20% of $20.00 and subtract it from $20.00:
   \[ 20 - (20 \times 0.20) = 20 - 4 = 16 \]
   So, she pays $16.00 for the frying pan.

4. Then, she buys a set of towels that is 10% off $30.00. To find out how much she pays for the towels, we calculate 10% of $30.00 and subtract it from $30.00:
   \[ 30 - (30 \times 0.10) = 30 - 3 = 27 \]
   So, she pays $27.00 for the towels.

5. Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to her new balance:
   \[ 70 + 16 + 27 = 113 \]

So, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00.

The final answer is: **$113.00**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light. When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. We need to find out how many jellyfish are in the tank.

First, let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( T \).

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We are told that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The correct answer is 90."

So, Caroline is 24 years old. The correct answer is:

24"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 salary each year. So, she saves:
\[ 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \text{ dollars per year} \]

She plans to live with 40% of her current salary in retirement. So, her living expenses in retirement will be:
\[ 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \text{ dollars per year} \]

She wants to save enough for 20 years of living expenses in retirement. So, the total amount she needs to save is:
\[ 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $20,000 each year, we need to find out how many years it will take her to save $800,000:
\[ \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \text{ years} \]

So, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

The answer is: **40 years**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Marty has a ribbon that is 100 centimeters long. He wants to cut this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find out how long each part will be, we divide 100 by 4:
\[ 100 \div 4 = 25 \text{ cm} \]
So, each part of the ribbon is 25 centimeters long.

Now, each of these 25 centimeter parts needs to be cut into 5 equal parts. To find out how long each of these smaller parts will be, we divide 25 by 5:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \text{ cm} \]
So, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

The length of each final cut is:
\[ \boxed{5 \text{ cm}} \]"
"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to figure out the total number of students in the school. We know that 40% of the students are boys and that number is 240 boys.

If 40% of the students is 240, we can find the total number of students by dividing 240 by 40% (or 0.40 in decimal form).

\[ \text{Total number of students} = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

So, there are 600 students in total in the school.

Now, to find out how many girls there are, we know that 60% of the students are girls (since 100% - 40% = 60%).

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 60\% \times 600 = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

The correct answer is: **360**"
"To find out how much my mom spent, we need to add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil, and then subtract the coupon.

\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

Now, we use the $7 coupon:
\[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

So, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop. The answer is:
\[ 38 \]"
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add up all the heel heights and then divide by the number of women.

We have:
- Three women wearing 4-inch heels, so that's \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women wearing 2-inch heels, so that's \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Adding these together gives us the total height of all the heels:
\[12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches}\]

There are 6 women in total, so we divide the total height by the number of women to find the average:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

So, the average height of the heels is 3 inches.

The correct answer is: 3 inches."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

June has 30 days. Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. She plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, so that's 250 miles per day.

To find out how many miles she needs to hike each day to complete her journey on time, we divide the total miles by the number of days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Soledad plans to hike 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we subtract the planned miles from the required miles:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles each day to complete her journey on time.

The answer is: **60 miles/day**"
"To find out how much the store will have received after selling all the balls, we need to add up the money made from selling each color of ball.

First, let's look at the red balls:
- There are 3 red balls.
- Each red ball costs $9.
- So, the money from red balls is \(3 \times 9 = 27\) dollars.

Next, let's look at the blue balls:
- There are 11 blue balls.
- Each blue ball costs $5.
- So, the money from blue balls is \(11 \times 5 = 55\) dollars.

Now, let's look at the green balls:
- There are 25 green balls.
- Each green ball costs $3.
- So, the money from green balls is \(25 \times 3 = 75\) dollars.

To find the total money the store will have received, we add up the money from all the balls:
- Money from red balls: $27
- Money from blue balls: $55
- Money from green balls: $75

Adding these together: \(27 + 55 + 75 = 157\)

So, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Pierre wants a quarter of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg} \]

Paul wants one-third of 12 kg, which is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg} \]

Now, let's add the amounts Pierre and Paul want:
\[ 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg} \]

The total amount of apples they bought is 12 kg. So, the amount left for James is:

So, James will have \boxed{5} kilograms left."
"The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius. It went down by 8 degrees, so we do 2 - 8 = -6 degrees. Then it went up by 3 degrees, so we do -6 + 3 = -3 degrees. So, in the morning, the temperature was -3 degrees Celsius.

The temperature in the morning was \boxed{-3} degrees Celsius."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Raymond started with $21.
2. He saved $11 more, so he had $21 + $11 = $32.
3. He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, so he spent a total of $5 + $19 = $24.
4. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total spent from the amount he had after saving: $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left. 

The final answer is: **$8**"
"Anna had a budget of $16 and spent $4 on other things. So, she had $16 - $4 = $12 left for the books. She bought 2 books and had $2 left after buying the books, so she spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books. Since she bought 2 books for $10, each book cost $10 ÷ 2 = $5. 

So, the cost of each book is $5. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To find out how many students are in the calligraphy class this year, we need to calculate a 20% increase on the 50 students from last year.

First, we find out what 20% of 50 is. We do this by multiplying 50 by 20 and then dividing by 100:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 20% of 50 is 10. This means there are 10 more students this year than last year.

Now, we add this 10 to the 50 students from last year:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60.

The correct answer is 60."
"To find out how long it takes for the lighthouse to blink 459 times, we first need to know how many times it blinks in one minute. We know it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, so we can calculate the number of blinks per minute:

\[
\text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Now, to find out how many minutes it takes to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by the number of blinks per minute:

\[
\text{Time in minutes} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take the lighthouse 9 minutes to blink 459 times. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"Let's count the fish Tate has now.

Initially, Tate had:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

Then, Tate bought:
- 2 more male guppies
- 1 more female guppy
- 2 more male goldfishes
- 3 more female goldfishes

Now, let's add these to the initial counts:
- Male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

So, Tate now has:
- 6 male fish
- 8 female fish

To find out how many more female fish there are than male fish, we subtract the number of male fish from the number of female fish:
\[ 8 - 6 = 2 \]

So, Tate has 2 more female fish than male fish. The answer is 2."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
Megan took 2 hours more than Amalia, so she took 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
Dior took more than 4 hours, but the problem says she took 12 hours.

Now, we add up all the hours:
4 (Amalia) + 6 (Megan) + 12 (Dior) = 22 hours.

So, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 22 hours.

The final answer is: **22 hours**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a simpler understanding.

John visits his parents twice a month. It takes him 2 hours to drive one way. We need to find out how many miles he drives in a month.

1. First, we calculate the distance for one way:
   - He drives for 2 hours at 70 miles per hour.
   - So, the distance for one way is \(70 \times 2 = 140\) miles.

2. Since he visits twice a month, the round trip (going and coming back) is:
   - \(140 \times 2 = 280\) miles.

So, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents. The answer is 280 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. In 7 days, she will walk:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

The problem says that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if we let \( B \) be the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we can write:
\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we divide 70 by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have 400 toys to make, and by the end of the shift, we still need 20 toys. So, the workers made 400 - 20 = 380 toys in total.

There are 5 workers in total, and 4 of them make toys at different rates. Two workers make 6 toys each hour, so together they make 6 + 6 = 12 toys per hour. Another two workers make 4 toys each hour, so together they make 4 + 4 = 8 toys per hour. So, the first four workers make 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.

In 10 hours, the first four workers make 20 toys/hour * 10 hours = 200 toys.

To make up the 380 toys they need to make, the fifth worker must make 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.

So, the fifth worker makes 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

The answer is 18 toys per hour."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add Kory's dog to Elijah's dogs:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds.

The final answer is: **105 pounds**"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So if Seth had \( S \) stickers, Luis got \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. So Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris got \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total.
4. Since Kris got 16 stickers, and that's half of what Luis gave him, we know \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
5. To find \( S \), we solve \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

So, Seth originally had 64 stickers.

The number of stickers Seth had in the beginning is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"John buys 3 large bags of M&Ms, and each bag weighs 10 ounces. So, the total weight of M&Ms is 30 ounces. If 1 ounce of M&Ms has 30 M&Ms, then 30 ounces will have:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, John can make 90 small bags of M&Ms. The answer is 90."
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we first need to calculate half of the Earth's circumference. The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth. The answer is 50 days."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step in a simple way.

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), then we have:
\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago, Vince was 7 years old. Now, we need to find out how old Vince is now. Since two years have passed, we add 2 to Vince's age two years ago:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs. Let's say they each painted \( A \) eggs.
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. So if Sarah painted \( S \) eggs, then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.
3. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. So we have:
   \[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
   Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[ A + S = 22 \]
4. We also know:
   \[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
   Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[ 2S = 18 \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[ S = 9 \]
5. Now we know Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since \( A + S = 22 \), we can find \( A \):
   \[ A + 9 = 22 \]
   So:
   \[ A = 13 \]
6. Now we know:
   - Arnold painted 13 eggs
   - Madeline painted 13 eggs
   - Sarah painted 9 eggs
   - Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs
7. To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
   \[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The answer is 8."
"Nik has 200 crayons and he wants to put them into groups of 8 crayons each. So, he can make 25 groups. Each group of crayons goes into one box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. So, 25 boxes will weigh 25 times 8 ounces, which is 200 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 200 crayons will weigh 200 ounces. Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together, we get 200 ounces from the crayons and 200 ounces from the boxes, which is 400 ounces in total. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide 400 ounces by 16 to get the weight in pounds. So, 400 divided by 16 is 25 pounds. 

The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds. 

So, the answer is 25 pounds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. John has a 80-foot tree. He can make logs from 80% of it. So, he can make logs from:
   \[ 80 \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

2. Each log is 4 feet long. So, from 64 feet, he can make:
   \[ \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

3. From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, from 16 logs, he can make:
   \[ 16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks} \]

4. He sells each plank for $1.2. So, the total money he makes is:
   \[ 80 \times 1.2 = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John makes $96. The correct answer is 96."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Valerie earns $5000 a month. Her brother earns twice that amount because she earns half of what he does. So, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add Valerie's and her brother's salaries together:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:

\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, to find out how much money they all have together, we add Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's salaries:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000.

The final answer is: **$45000**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Grandma walks 3 miles a day. She walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. On the beach, she walks for 40 minutes. We need to find out how long it takes her to walk the whole 3 miles.

First, we know she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. So, to find out how long it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach, we divide 40 minutes by 2:
\[ 40 \div 2 = 20 \text{ minutes per mile on the beach} \]

Now, since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, it will take her:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time she spends walking is the time on the beach plus the time on the sidewalk:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 60 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Jane has been saving $4 each week for 8 weeks, so she has saved $32. She needs to save $60 in total. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract $32 from $60:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Jane saves $4 each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining $28, we divide $28 by $4:

\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The answer is:

7 weeks"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We have:
- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. So, \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds.
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. So, \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds.
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, we add all these together:
\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

So, the total number of blue birds is 32."
"Bob starts with some marbles and if he gets 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. So, if we take away the 24 marbles he got, he originally had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles. Now, if he loses 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left. 

So, the number of marbles Bob will have is 26. 

The correct answer is 26."
"Donny needs to drink water that is at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other mug is an unknown temperature, let's call it T degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. This leaves 29 degrees in the 33-degree mug. He also pours 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. The temperature of the water he pours from the other mug is T - 1 degrees.

The average temperature of the water in his water bottle is the sum of the temperatures of the water from both mugs divided by the total volume (5 ounces):

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5}
\]

For Donny to be able to drink the water, this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees:

\[
\frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the inequality:

\[
29 + T - 1 \geq 200
\]

\[
28 + T \geq 200
\]

\[
T \geq 172
\]

So, the second mug must be at least 172 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{172}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

At the start, Melanie's father has 50 cows and 20 chickens. Every day, 20 more cows and 10 more chickens come to the farm. We need to find out how many animals there are after 21 days (which is three weeks).

First, let's see how many cows come in 21 days:
- 20 cows/day × 21 days = 420 cows

Now, let's see how many chickens come in 21 days:
- 10 chickens/day × 21 days = 210 chickens

So, after 21 days, the farm will have:
- 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows
- 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Now, let's add all the animals together:
- 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

So, after three weeks, there are 700 animals on the farm. The answer is 700."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Russell orders 4 packs of bagels. Each pack costs $10.00, so 4 packs cost:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

But he gets a 10% discount on the total. So, the discount is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after the discount, the total cost is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he gets 4 packs of bagels, and each pack has 9 bagels, so he gets:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find out how much each bagel costs, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, each single bagel costs:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we do:

23 - 5 = 18 scoops

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. The problem tells us that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops. So, we do:

6 - 3 = 3 potatoes for 2 scoops

Now, to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a simple ratio:

3 potatoes for 2 scoops
? potatoes for 18 scoops

We can solve this by setting up a proportion:

3/2 = x/18

To find x, we cross-multiply:

2x = 3 * 18
2x = 54
x = 54 / 2
x = 27

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The answer is 27."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate how many eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.
- So, \(3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs}\).

Next, we calculate how many eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days:
- Chester eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.
- So, \(5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs}\).

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs:
- Total eggs = 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
- \(240 \, \text{eggs} \div 12 = 20 \, \text{dozen}\).

So, Chester will need 20 dozen eggs for 60 days. The answer is 20."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We know there are 17 green jellybeans and twice as many red jellybeans. So, the number of red jellybeans is:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Now, we add the green and red jellybeans together:
\[ 17 + 34 = 51 \]

The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. To find out how many are blue, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total:
\[ 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Tim grows 5 trees, and each year he gets 6 lemons from each tree. So, to find out how many lemons he gets in one year, we do this:

\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Now, a decade is 10 years. So, to find out how many lemons he gets in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in one year by 10:

\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

So, Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade. The answer is 300."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. Together, they make 14 parts in total.

First, we need to find out how many parts each number represents. We do this by dividing the total number of passengers by the total parts:
\[ \text{Each part} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find out how many men and women there are:
- Number of men = 5 parts = 5 × 6 = 30
- Number of women = 9 parts = 9 × 6 = 54

So, there are 30 men and 54 women on the bus.

Next, we are told that 20 women alight from the bus. To find out how many women remain, we subtract 20 from the total number of women:
\[ \text{Women remaining} = 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34.

The correct answer is: **34**"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Sunflower Sales:**
   - Faraday earns $2 for each sunflower.
   - He earned $26 from selling sunflowers.
   - So, the number of sunflowers sold per day = \(\frac{26}{2} = 13\) sunflowers.

2. **Bouquet Sales:**
   - Faraday earns $8 for each bouquet.
   - He earned $56 from selling bouquets.
   - So, the number of bouquets sold per day = \(\frac{56}{8} = 7\) bouquets.
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, so the number of sunflowers in 7 bouquets = \(7 \times 12 = 84\) sunflowers.

3. **Total Sunflowers Sold Per Day:**
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers from sunflowers + Sunflowers from bouquets = \(13 + 84 = 97\) sunflowers.

4. **Total Sunflowers Sold After 3 Days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold after 3 days = \(97 \times 3 = 291\) sunflowers.

So, the number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is 291."
"Adam starts with $100. He buys rocks at $5 each. If he spends all his money, he can buy:

He then sells 60% of these rocks. So, he sells:

\[
20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
\]

Each rock is sold for $7, so he gets:

\[
12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}

"To find out how many days Lauren will need to complete the project, we need to calculate the days for each type of picture scene and then add them up.

1. For the large-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized scenes.
   - To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total scenes by the scenes she can draw per day: \(45 \div 5 = 9\) days.

2. For the medium-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized scenes.
   - To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total scenes by the scenes she can draw per day: \(36 \div 6 = 6\) days.

3. For the small-sized picture scenes:
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized scenes.
   - To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total scenes by the scenes she can draw per day: \(49 \div 7 = 7\) days.

Now, we add up the days for all the picture scenes:
- Large-sized: 9 days
- Medium-sized: 6 days
- Small-sized: 7 days

So, the total number of days is \(9 + 6 + 7 = 22\) days.

Therefore, the answer is 22 days."

Now, she has to share these 36 eggs equally among her 4 children. To find out how many eggs each child gets, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. So, we do \(36 \div 4 = 9\).

Each child gets 9 eggs. So, the answer is 9 eggs."
"To find out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in May, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, we know that each fish needs $1 worth of food every day. Jen has 3 fish, so the total cost of food for all the fish each day is:
\[ 3 \text{ fish} \times \$1 \text{ per fish per day} = \$3 \text{ per day} \]

May has 31 days. So, to find out the total cost for the whole month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May:
\[ \$3 \text{ per day} \times 31 \text{ days} = \$93 \]

So, Jen spends \(\boxed{93}\) dollars on food in the month of May."
"Patricia started with 30 roses. She gave 24 roses to her mother, so she had:

\[ 30 - 24 = 6 \]

roses left. Then she bought 15 more roses, so she now has:

\[ 6 + 15 = 21 \]

roses.

So, Patricia now has 21 roses. The answer is 21."
"To find the average speed, we need to add up the total distance Sid traveled and then divide by the total time he spent traveling.

Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. So, the total distance is:

\[ 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

The total time is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour. The correct answer is:

\[ \text{50 miles per hour} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Mark has two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. That means if he buys 10 tickets, he might win 2 times.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one. So, if the first ticket has a 20% chance, the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning. That's because 20% times 3 equals 60%.

Now, we want to know the chance that both tickets win. To find this, we multiply the chances of each ticket winning:
- First ticket wins: 20% or 0.20
- Second ticket wins: 60% or 0.60

So, we do:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To change 0.12 to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Jim collected 27 seashells. The problem says Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. So, if we let the number of seashells Carlos collected be \( C \), then:
\[ C + 5 = 27 \]
To find \( C \), we subtract 5 from 27:
\[ C = 27 - 5 = 22 \]
So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Next, the problem says Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If we let the number of seashells Carrey collected be \( R \), then:
\[ C = 2R \]
Since we know \( C = 22 \), we can find \( R \) by dividing 22 by 2:
\[ R = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]
So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we add up all the seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:
\[ 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \]
They divided these seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 of them, each person gets:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]
So, each person got 20 seashells.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to add up the carrots he eats on weekdays and the carrots he eats on weekends.

First, let's look at the weekdays. Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, let's look at the weekend. Mason eats 5 carrots each day on Saturday and Sunday. There are 2 days in the weekend, so:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the carrots eaten on weekdays and the carrots eaten on the weekend:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week. The correct answer is 30."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we start with the first song which is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. So, we need to find out how much longer the second song is and then add that to the first song's time.

First, let's find out how much longer the second song is:
- 60% of 5 minutes is calculated as \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) minutes.
- So, the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song.

Now, we add the extra 3 minutes to the 5 minutes of the first song:
- \(5 + 3 = 8\) minutes.

So, the second song is 8 minutes long.

Now, we add the time of the first song and the second song together:
- \(5 + 8 = 13\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The answer is: 13 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice that amount. So, he sells it for $40.

Last Monday, he bought 2 devices, so the cost for those 2 devices is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices, so the cost for those 4 devices is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for all the devices he bought is:
\[ 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

He sold all the devices for:
\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much profit he made, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Linus made is:
\[ 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Isabel is 7 feet tall.
2. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is \(7 - 2 = 5\) feet tall.
3. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is \(5 + 1 = 6\) feet tall.
4. Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the cane is \(6 \div 2 = 3\) feet long.

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet. The answer is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many bottles are needed for 2300 people. Since each person needs 5 bottles (because 20% of a bottle covers 1 person's daily energy need), we multiply 2300 by 5:
   \[
   2300 \times 5 = 11500 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. Now, we know Hortex can produce 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the number of bottles they can produce from the number of bottles needed:
   \[
   11500 - 4200 = 7300 \text{ bottles}
   \]

So, Hortex needs to produce 7300 more bottles of juice to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7300}
\]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

Carla has 8 babies in total. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue.

First, we find out how many babies are dressed in purple:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \]
So, 6 babies are dressed in purple.

Next, we find out how many babies are dressed in blue:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]
So, 2 babies are dressed in blue.

Now, we know that all the babies dressed in blue also wear bows. So, 2 babies wear bows.

Also, 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple wear bows:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \]
So, 2 babies dressed in purple also wear bows.

Now, we have a total of 3 babies wearing bows (2 in blue and 1 in purple).

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the number of purple-wearers wearing bows and the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 100 = 66.67\% \]

So, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 66.67%.

The final answer is:
\[ 66.67\% \]"
"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total reports received last week.

The total number of reports received last week is 5168.

The number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.

The number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

So, we calculate the reports received on Wednesday as follows:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Abraham has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it first. Half of 80 is 40, so he sold 40 square meters for $50. That means he got $50 for 40 square meters, so the price per square meter was $50 / 40 = $1.25 per square meter.

Next, he sold another 1/4 of his land. 1/4 of 80 is 20, so he sold 20 square meters for $30. That means he got $30 for 20 square meters, so the price per square meter was $30 / 20 = $1.50 per square meter.

Now, he has 20 square meters left, and he sold these for $3 per square meter. So, he got 20 * $3 = $60 from these.

Adding up all the money he got:
$50 (from the first sale) + $30 (from the second sale) + $60 (from the remaining land) = $140.

So, the total money Abraham will earn is $140. The answer is C."
"To find Geb's age, we start with Haley's age, which is 26 years.

Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age. So, we first find half of Haley's age:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

Then, we subtract 10 from 13 to find Geb's age:
\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

So, Geb is 3 years old.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Tyrion goes out 3 times a day and changes his face mask 2 times each time he goes out. So, each time he goes out, he uses 2 face masks. If he goes out 3 times a day, then in one day he uses:
\[ 3 \text{ times} \times 2 \text{ masks/time} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \]

Now, we want to know how many masks he uses in 2 days. So we multiply the number of masks he uses in one day by 2:
\[ 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks} \]

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days. The answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since a dozen is 12, 3 dozen is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Lamar found 5 eggs.
Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add up all the eggs they found:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs still hidden is:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first two apartment complexes each have 200 apartments. So together, they have:
   \[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

2. The third apartment complex has 60% more apartments than the first two combined. So we calculate 60% of 400:
   \[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]
   Adding this to the 400 from the first two complexes:
   \[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

3. John collects garbage 3 times a week from each of the three complexes. So the total number of collections in a week is:
   \[ 3 \times (200 + 200 + 640) = 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

4. John gets paid $0.40 for each collection. So his total earnings in a week are:
   \[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John makes $1248 in a week. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To find out how many fruits an avocado tree can produce in 10 years, let's add up the fruits year by year:

- In the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the 6th year, it produces 3 times 50 fruits, which is 150 fruits.
- In the 7th year, it produces 7 times 50 fruits, which is 350 fruits.
- In the 8th year, it produces 10 times 50 fruits minus 200, which is 500 - 200 = 300 fruits.
- In the 9th year, it doesn't produce any fruits.
- In the 10th year, it produces 20 times 50 fruits, which is 1000 fruits.

Now, let's add all these up:
50 (5th year) + 150 (6th year) + 350 (7th year) + 300 (8th year) + 0 (9th year) + 1000 (10th year) = 1850 fruits.

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce in 10 years is 1850."
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $20. Jack originally had $100. So, if we add the $20 Sophia gave him to the $100 he already had, Jack now has $120. 

So, the final amount of money Jack has now is $120. 

The correct answer is: **$120**"
"Let's solve this step by step.

We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so if we let the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters, the red rope \( R \) is \( 4B \) centimeters.

We also know the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so if we let the yellow rope be \( Y \) centimeters, then \( B = Y - 7 \).

The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we have:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the total length equation:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Now, we know \( B = Y - 7 \), so we can substitute \( B \) in the equation:
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now we can find \( B \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And the red rope:
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Ronnie got $5. Rissa got three times what Ronnie got, so Rissa got $15.

They each gave the same amount of money, $3, to their sister. So, we need to find out how much money Ronnie has left.

Ronnie started with $5 and gave $3 to his sister, so:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, Ronnie is left with $2.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. The mural has four different colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. It's given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and half the mural is yellow.

First, we know that half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

This means the red, white, and purple paint together make up the other half of the mural:
\[ R + W + P = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can say:
\[ R = W = P \]

So, if we add these together:
\[ R + R + R = 3R = 6 \text{ pints} \]

To find \( R \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ R = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ pints} \]

So, the amount of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to add up the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house.

First, let's find the area of one bedroom:
- One bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet.
- So, the area of one bedroom is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of the bedrooms is:
- \(4 \times 240 = 960\) square feet.

Next, we know the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, the area of the living room is:
- \(5 \times 240 = 1200\) square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add up all these areas to get the total area of the house:
- Total area = area of bedrooms + area of living room + area of the rest of the house
- Total area = \(960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160\) square feet.

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for Alice's cloud counting.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, so that's \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.

On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so that's \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.

On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.

On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, so that's \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, let's add all these up:
\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48\]

Adding them step by step:
\[3 + 6 = 9\]
\[9 + 12 = 21\]
\[21 + 24 = 45\]
\[45 + 48 = 93\]

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted a total of 93 puffs of clouds. The final answer is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. The original box has 100 dishwasher pods and costs $12.
2. The new box has 20% more pods than the original box. So, 20% of 100 is 20, and adding that to 100 gives us 120 pods.
3. The new box also costs $12, so each pod costs $12 divided by 120, which is $0.10 per pod.
4. If each cycle uses 1 pod, then for $1, you can buy 10 pods because $1 divided by $0.10 per pod equals 10.

So, the number of cycles you can run for $1 is 10.

The answer is: **10**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he gets, we divide $1000 by $20:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. He loses 10 bills on the way home. So, he has:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   So, he has:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills left}
   \]

4. He then triples his money. Since each bill is $20, his total money is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Tripling this amount gives:
   \[
   3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Finally, he converts all his money to $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, Thomas has 240 $5 bills. The final answer is 240."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

In the first half:
- Team A scored 4 goals.
- Team B scored 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scored 2 goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scored 4 times what it scored in the first half, so Team B scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals.
- Team A scored 1/4 of what Team B scored in the second half, so Team A scored 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

Now, let's add up all the goals:
- Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals in total.
- Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals in total.

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.

The final answer is 16."
"Let's break down the problem step by step in a simpler way.

1. The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday.
2. By the end of Monday, he used 45% of the chalk. So, he used:
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   This means he has:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]
   of chalk left.

3. The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, each day he uses:
   \[
   0.20 \times \text{remaining chalk}
   \]

4. Let's calculate how much chalk is left each day:
   - **Tuesday**: 
     \[
     0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he has:
     \[
     2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Wednesday**:
     \[
     0.20 \times 2.20 = 0.44 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he has:
     \[
     2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Thursday**:
     \[
     0.20 \times 1.76 = 0.352 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he has:
     \[
     1.76 - 0.352 = 1.408 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Friday**:
     \[
     0.20 \times 1.408 = 0.2816 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he has:
     \[
     1.408 - 0.2816 = 1.1264 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Saturday**:
     \[
     0.20 \times 1.1264 = 0.22528 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he has:
     \[
     1.1264 - 0.22528 = 0.90112 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Sunday**:
     \[
     0.20 \times 0.90112 = 0.180224 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he has:
     \[
     0.90112 - 0.180224 = 0.720896 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. Since the chalk remaining on Sunday is 0.720896 inches, it is not recycled yet.

6. Let's check the next day:
   - **Monday of next week**:
     \[
     0.20 \times 0.720896 = 0.1441792 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he has:
     \[
     0.720896 - 0.1441792 = 0.5767168 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Tuesday of next week**:
     \[
     0.20 \times 0.5767168 = 0.11534336 \text{ inches}

     0.2952790016 - 0.05905580032 = 0.23622320128 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Saturday of next week**:
     \[
     0.20 \times 0.23622320128 = 0.047244640256 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he has:
     \[
     0.23622320128 - 0.047244640256 = 0.188978561024 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Sunday of next week**:
     \[
     0.20 \times 0.188978561024 = 0.0377957122048 \text{ inches}
     \]
     So, he has:
     \[
     0.188978561024 - 0.0377957122048 = 0.1511828488192 \text{ inches}
     \]

Since the chalk remaining on Sunday of the next week is 0.1511828488192 inches, which is still greater than 2 inches, the teacher will continue to use the chalk until it is recycled.

7. The teacher has 7 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

So, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls. We need to find out how many students are not on varsity.

First, we find out how many girls are on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

Next, we find out how many boys are on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Now, we calculate the number of girls and boys not on varsity.

- Number of girls not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

- Number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

To find the total number of students not on varsity, we add the number of girls and boys not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

So, the number of students not on varsity is 17."
"Okay, let me explain it simply:

Mike bought 5 face masks. Johnny bought 2 more than three times what Mike bought. So, we first find out how many face masks three times what Mike bought is. Three times 5 is 15. Then we add 2 to 15, which gives us 17.

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

The answer is: 17"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

James has 30 teeth. His dentist does two things:
1. Drills 4 teeth.
2. Caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so that's 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

So, the dentist fixes 4 teeth by drilling and 11 teeth by capping. That's a total of 4 + 11 = 15 teeth fixed.

To find out what percentage of his teeth this is, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk from the company. Each gallon cost $3.5. So, the total cost was:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

Mr. Marcellus found that 2/5 of the milk had gone bad and couldn't be sold. So, the amount of bad milk is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The company will give back the money for the bad milk. Since each gallon costs $3.5, the refund amount is:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's use a simpler way to understand these.

First, let's say Colin's current age is \( C \) and Wendy's current age is \( W \).

From the first piece of information:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
This means Wendy's age is five times Colin's age in seven years.

From the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]
This means in 25 years, Colin's age will be a third of Wendy's current age.

Now, let's try to find out Colin's current age. We know:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
So, Wendy's age is \( 5C + 35 \).

Now, we use the second piece of information:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]
To make it simpler, let's solve this step by step:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5C + 35}{3} \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]
Now, let's move the terms involving \( C \) to one side and the numbers to the other:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is 20.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Bob gets $27,000 to buy books. He can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we divide $27,000 by $500:

\[ 27000 \div 500 = 54 \]

So, for every $500, he can buy 100 books. Now, to find out how many books he can buy with $27,000:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

He can buy 5400 books in total. Since he has to share these books equally among 3 schools, we divide 5400 by 3:

\[ 5400 \div 3 = 1800 \]

So, each school gets 1800 books. The answer is 1800 books per school."
"Let's count the apples step by step:

1. First, two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 2

2. Newton picked up these two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 1 (remaining apple)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1 (pocketed apple) + 1 (thrown apple) = 2

3. Newton picked up the remaining apple, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 0 (all apples thrown)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 2 (pocketed apples) + 1 (thrown apple) = 3

4. Another 6 apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 3 (pocketed apples) + 6 (picked up apples) = 9

So, Newton brought home 9 apples. The answer is 9."
"To find out how much Ali's order costs, we need to figure out how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. 

First, we divide the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[
850 \text{ kg} \div 50 \text{ kg/bag} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Now, we know Ali is buying 17 bags, and each bag costs $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is $306. 

The correct answer is: **306**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs. Each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, and her 6 friends each eat 6 slices. So, we calculate:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since each cheese pizza has 12 slices, we need:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pepperoni pizzas Kate needs. Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, and her 6 friends each eat 4 slices. So, we calculate:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza has 8 slices, we need:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. In total, she needs to buy:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is 6."
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, the total miles are:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}
  \]

- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, the total miles are:
  \[
  5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}
  \]

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days:
\[
9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"To find out how long it will take Jay to make 60 snowballs, we need to consider how many he makes and how many melt.

Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. Let's see how many snowballs he actually makes in an hour after accounting for the ones that melt.

First, let's find out how many 15-minute intervals are in an hour:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 4 \text{ intervals} \]

In each 15-minute interval, 2 snowballs melt, so in 4 intervals, the number of snowballs that melt is:
\[ 2 \text{ snowballs/interval} \times 4 \text{ intervals} = 8 \text{ snowballs} \]

So, the number of snowballs Jay actually makes in an hour is:
\[ 20 \text{ snowballs} - 8 \text{ snowballs} = 12 \text{ snowballs} \]

Now, to find out how many hours it takes to make 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs by the number he makes in an hour:
\[ 60 \text{ snowballs} \div 12 \text{ snowballs/hour} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to make 60 snowballs."
"When Digimon came out, John was 28 years old and he was twice as old as Jim. So, if John was 28 when the show came out, Jim must have been half that age. 

\[ \text{Jim's age when the show came out} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Since no time has passed since then, Jim is still 14 years old now.

So, the answer is 14."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

Doxa cut an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 piece. Her sister ate 1 more piece than Doxa, so her sister ate 2 pieces. Her brother ate 1 more piece than her sister, so her brother ate 3 pieces.

Now, let's add up how many pieces they ate together:
- Doxa ate 1 piece
- Her sister ate 2 pieces
- Her brother ate 3 pieces

So, \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)

They all ate 6 pieces of apple together. 

The final answer is 6."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 + 100 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used \(81 - 78 = 3\) bandages more than they needed to reach 78 bandages.

Since they had 81 bandages after ordering and using 25, and they ended up with 78, it means they used 3 more bandages than necessary. This confirms the calculations.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{62}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

May's hair was originally 10 inches long and she ended up with 8 inches of hair. So, she had 2 inches of hair cut off. The cost to cut her hair is $30 for every inch. So, for 2 inches, it would cost:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars/inch} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The color cost is $40. So, the total cost is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for May's haircut and color is $100."
"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her earnings from her work and her bonus for being on time.

First, let's see how much Jen earns in a day:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings:
- Jen works 6 days a week.

So, her weekly earnings are:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270.00 \]

Jen also gets a $10 bonus for being on time each week. Since she didn't miss any days in April, she gets this bonus for 4 weeks:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we add her total earnings for the month and her total bonus:
\[ \$270.00 + \$40.00 = \$310.00 \]

So, Jen will receive:
\[
\boxed{310}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money Jason earned.

First, we look at what Jason earns each week:
- Doing laundry: $3.00
- Cleaning his room: $1.50
- Taking the trash out: $0.75
- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.50

Now, let's add up what Jason did in the two-week period:
- He did laundry once, so that's $3.00.
- He cleaned his room once, so that's $1.50.
- He took the trash out twice, so that's $0.75 x 2 = $1.50.
- He emptied the dishwasher 6 times, so that's $0.50 x 6 = $3.00.

Now, let's add all these amounts together:
- $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (taking trash) + $3.00 (emptying dishwasher) = $9.00

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood.
2. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale. So, a shark has \(3 \times 40 = 120\) gallons of blood.
3. Now, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. Since each shark has 120 gallons, ten sharks will have \(10 \times 120 = 1200\) gallons of blood.

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is 1200 gallons.

The correct answer is: **1200 gallons**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On a particular day, 50 people came to eat in the morning. Then, at 10:00, 40 more people came. That's 50 + 40 = 90 people in the morning and at 10:00.

After that, twice as many people as those who came at 10:00 came later. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people came later.

By evening, 3 times as many people as those who came in the morning came. So, \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people came in the evening.

Now, let's add all these up:
- Morning: 50 people
- 10:00: 40 people
- Later: 80 people
- Evening: 150 people

So, the total number of people who came is 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 260.

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 260."
"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack has 5 pens, so she bought 5 × 5 = 25 red pens. She also bought twice as many black pens as red pens, so she bought 2 × 25 = 50 black pens. To find out how many pens Alain has in total, we add the red pens and the black pens together: 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens. So, Alain has 75 pens. The answer is 75."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. So, each bottle of scotch costs:
\[ \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch. So, he buys:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than each bottle of scotch. So, the cost of each bottle of cognac is:
\[ 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:
\[ 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:
\[ 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. On the same day, he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, so that's 20 plus 10, which is 30 trees. For the Lodgepole Pine trees, he planted 1/4 more than the first day, so that's 40 plus 1/4 of 40, which is 40 plus 10, making it 50 trees.

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted:
- White Oak trees: 20 (first day) + 30 (second day) = 50 trees
- Lodgepole Pine trees: 40 (first day) + 50 (second day) = 90 trees

So, the total number of trees he planted is 50 (White Oak) + 90 (Lodgepole Pine) = 140 trees.

The total number of trees Mr. Julius planted in the two days is 140."
"Let's work through the problem step by step to find out how much root beer is left for the party.

1. Fred starts with 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drink 4 gallons, so:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. Barbie spills 7 gallons, so:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have the equation: \(4x + 8 = 40\).

First, we need to get rid of the 8. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8\]
\[4x = 32\]

Now, to find \(x\), we divide both sides by 4:
\[\frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4}\]
\[x = 8\]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The answer is: \(\boxed{8}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We start with 66 fish in the tank.

1. One-third of the fish have red stripes. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]
   So, 22 fish have red stripes.

2. Now, we need to find out how many fish are left after taking out the 22 fish with red stripes:
   \[
   66 - 22 = 44
   \]
   So, 44 fish are left.

3. Out of these 44 fish, 5/11 have blue stripes. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]
   So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

4. To find out how many fish have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:
   \[
   22 + 20 = 42
   \]

So, the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes is 42.

The final answer is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Amy starts with two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors. So, that's 2 × 4 = 8 colors.
2. She also has three makeup sets, each with 6 colors. So, that's 3 × 6 = 18 colors.
3. Adding these together, she has 8 + 18 = 26 colors in total.

Now, her sister takes one of the eyeshadow palettes, which has 4 colors. So, she loses 4 colors:
26 - 4 = 22 colors left.

Next, Amy uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Each makeup set has 6 colors, so half of that is 6 ÷ 2 = 3 colors.
So, she uses 3 colors, and that leaves her with:
22 - 3 = 19 colors.

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is 19."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Mattison is 60 inches tall. His house is 7 times as tall as he is, so:
\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor of the house is 3 times as high as Mattison, so:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

The total height of the house is 420 inches, and the first floor is 180 inches, so the second floor must be:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is 240 inches.

The answer is: **240 inches**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. First, we find out how many shells team Alphas got. They got 40% of 700 shells.
   - 40% of 700 is the same as 40 out of 100, so we do 700 * 40 / 100 = 280 shells.

2. Now, we subtract the shells team Alphas got from the total. That leaves us with 700 - 280 = 420 shells.

3. Team The finders got 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
   - 60% of 420 is the same as 60 out of 100, so we do 420 * 60 / 100 = 252 shells.

4. Now, we subtract the shells team The finders got from the remaining 420 shells. That leaves us with 420 - 252 = 168 shells.

So, team Gogetters got 168 shells. The answer is 168."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by adding up the miles the first three dogs need to walk:
- The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
- The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
- The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

So, the total miles for the first three dogs is:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

We know the average distance all four dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total distance they need to walk together is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total miles the first three dogs need to walk from the total miles all four dogs need to walk:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. The correct answer is:
4 miles"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. John's house is worth $250,000.
2. He gets a loan worth 40% of that. So, the loan amount is:
   \[
   0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
   \]
3. He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts. So, the amount used to pay off debts is:
   \[
   0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
   \]
4. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount:
   \[
   100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
   \]

So, the money John has leftover after paying off his debts is $40,000. The correct answer is:

- First tuna: 56 kilograms
- Second tuna: 46 kilograms
- Third tuna: 26 kilograms

First, let's add these weights together:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, we know that each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. So, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars per kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Deandre will earn **64 dollars**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Trinity buys magazines for $72 each. She sells them for 11/8 of that price. First, we need to find out how much she sells each magazine for.

To do this, we multiply $72 by 11/8:
\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 99 \]

So, she sells each magazine for $99.

Now, to find out her profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[ 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Brian's dehumidifier has three settings:
- Low setting: 1 liter of water removed per day.
- Medium setting: 2 liters of water removed per day (twice the low setting).
- High setting: 4 liters of water removed per day (twice the medium setting).

Brian used the dehumidifier for different days:
- 3 days on the low setting.
- 3 days on the medium setting.
- 5 days on the high setting.

First, let's calculate how much water was removed each time:
- For the low setting: 1 liter/day × 3 days = 3 liters.
- For the medium setting: 2 liters/day × 3 days = 6 liters.
- For the high setting: 4 liters/day × 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, let's add up all the water removed:
3 liters (low setting) + 6 liters (medium setting) + 20 liters (high setting) = 29 liters.

So, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters. The answer is \boxed{29}."
"To find out how many balloons were thrown, we start by calculating the total number of balloons they had at the beginning. They had 10 packs, and each pack had 30 balloons. So, we multiply 10 by 30:

\[ 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the 12 balloons that were left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 - 12 = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the number of balloons thrown is 288. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{288}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much medicine is in one dose. We know that for one dose, Saanvi uses 14 mL of the first medicine and 3 times that amount of the second medicine. So, the second medicine is:

\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL} \]

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in one dose, we add the first and second medicines together:

\[ 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL} \]

So, one dose has 56 mL of medicine.

Next, we need to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses. We do this by multiplying the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \text{ mL} \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL} \]

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL.

The final answer is \(\boxed{448}\) mL."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Ali's class can have 120 students.
2. Each of John's classes can have \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class. So, \( \frac{1}{8} \) of 120 is 15 students.
3. Since John has two classes, the total number of students in John's classes is \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \).
4. Now, to find the total capacity of both schools, we add Ali's class and John's classes together: \( 120 + 30 = 150 \).

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students.

The correct answer is: **150**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an extra 2%. First, we need to find out how much the extra 2% is. We do this by multiplying $300 by 2% (or 0.02):

\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]

So, the extra amount is $6. Now, we add this to the original $300 to find out the total amount Stephen will return:

\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Stephen will pay $25 each month for 11 months. So, we calculate the total amount he will pay in 11 months:

\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid over the first 11 months from the total amount he needs to return:

\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we start by calculating the total number of diaper changes for both children. Each child needs 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children, so the total is:

\[ 5 \text{ changes/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of the diaper changes. So, she changes:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

This means Jordan changes the other half, which is also:

\[ 5 \text{ changes} \]

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day. The answer is:

5"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar is a square box with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for the jelly beans:**
   Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we use:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans:**
   Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The real number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off. The answer is 36."
"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The bus starts with 20 people on it.
2. At the first stop, 40 more people get on the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who got on at the first stop get on the bus. So, the number of people who get on at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
   Adding these to the bus, the total number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
4. At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubles. So, the number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people can get on the bus, we subtract the number of people already on the bus from the bus's capacity:
   \[
   200 - 180 = 20
   \]

So, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. The cost of one visit to the museum is $2.
2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. So, the new cost is $2 plus 150% of $2.
   - 150% of $2 is $2 * 1.5 = $3.
   - So, the new cost is $2 + $3 = $5.
3. Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. Over 5 years, she visits 3 * 5 = 15 times.
   - The cost for these 15 visits is 15 * $2 = $30.
4. For the next 3 years, she visits 3 * 3 = 9 times.
   - The cost for these 9 visits is 9 * $5 = $45.
5. The total cost for all visits is $30 + $45 = $75.

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $75."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We have students in grades 4, 5, and 6. That's 10 students in each grade, and there are 3 grades, so we have 10 students/grade * 3 grades = 30 students in total.

2. Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. So, we need to figure out how many groups of 8 students we can make from 30 students. We do this by dividing 30 by 8, which gives us 3.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to the next whole number, which is 4 groups.

3. Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, if we have 4 groups, the total time will be 4 groups * 45 minutes/group = 180 minutes.

So, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room. The answer is 180 minutes."
"John made 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. To find out how much Ali has to pay, we first calculate the cost of the tables and frames separately.

The cost of the tables is:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times \$20 \text{ per table} = \$80 \]

The cost of the roof frames is:
\[ 2 \text{ frames} \times \$10 \text{ per frame} = \$20 \]

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the frames together:
\[ \$80 + \$20 = \$100 \]

So, Ali has to pay John \$100. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have a board that is 40 feet long. We need to cut it into two pieces where one piece is 4 times longer than the other.

Let's say the shorter piece is \( x \) feet long. Then the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet long.

The total length of the board is the sum of these two pieces:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet long."
"To find out how much of Aiden's secret seasoning he needs, we can follow these steps:

First, we need to know how much meat Aiden needs to make 80 meatballs. We know that 1 pound of meat makes 16 meatballs. So, to find out how many pounds of meat are needed for 80 meatballs, we divide 80 by 16:

\[ \text{Pounds of meat} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat. So, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is:

\[ \text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find out how much fabric Luke should buy, we first need to know the total width of all the windows. There are five windows, and each window is 35 inches wide. So, we add up the widths of all the windows:

\[ 35 + 35 + 35 + 35 + 35 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Now, Luke needs to buy fabric that is 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric. The correct answer is 350 inches."
"To find out how much a 36-minute call costs, we need to break it into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the rest of the call.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, we calculate:
\[ 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

After 16 minutes, the cost drops to $0.2 per minute. So, for the next 20 minutes, the cost is:
\[ 20 \times 0.2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the first 16 minutes and the next 20 minutes:
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00.

The final answer is:

"To find out how much rain there will be on Tuesday, we start with the rain on Monday, which is 2 inches. The problem says that Tuesday's rain will be 1 inch more than twice the amount of rain on Monday.

First, we calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday:
- Twice 2 inches is 4 inches.

Then, we add 1 inch to that amount:
- 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches.

So, the amount of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Carly makes cupcakes and brownies for her class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. There are 5 people in her class, and each person gets 2 treats. So, the total number of treats is 5 times 2, which is 10.

Let's say Carly made \( C \) cupcakes. Then she made \( 3C - 2 \) brownies because she makes 2 less than three times the number of cupcakes.

The total number of treats is the cupcakes plus the brownies, so:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]

Adding 2 to both sides gives:
\[ 4C = 12 \]

Dividing both sides by 4 gives:
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. Let's check:
- If she made 3 cupcakes, then she made \( 3 \times 3 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \) brownies.
- The total number of treats is \( 3 + 7 = 10 \), which matches the number of people in the class.

Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is 3. The answer is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost of a basic manicure is $35.
2. The cost of a basic pedicure is $40.
3. So, the total cost for both services without any discount is $35 + $40 = $75.
4. The salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. So, the discount amount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 × $75 = $15.
5. After applying the discount, the total cost is $75 - $15 = $60.
6. Karen also wants nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers, and each nail art costs $3. So, the total cost for nail art is 10 × $3 = $30.
7. Adding the cost of nail art to the discounted total cost of the manicure and pedicure, we get $60 + $30 = $90.

So, Karen would pay $90 in all. The correct answer is:

\boxed{90}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Susan has 3 magazines that send 12 issues each year. So, that's:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

She also has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, that's:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues} \]

The last magazine sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's add all the issues together:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since each issue is one magazine, Susan gets:
\[ \boxed{66} \text{ magazines every year} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Samantha has 27 paintings. The problem tells us that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to Samantha's paintings, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has. 

\[ 27 + 12 = 39 \]

So, Shelley has 39 paintings. Now, the problem also says that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from Shelley's paintings.

\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]

So, Kim has 31 paintings. 

The final answer is: \(\boxed{31}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way:

1. In November, the toy costs $40.
2. In December, the price goes up by 80%. To find out how much it goes up, we calculate 80% of $40:
   \[
   80\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.80 \times 40 = 32
   \]
   So, the price in December is:
   \[
   40 + 32 = 72
   \]
   The price in December is $72.
3. In January, the price goes down by 50%. To find out how much it goes down, we calculate 50% of $72:
   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 72 = 0.50 \times 72 = 36
   \]
   So, the price in January is:
   \[
   72 - 36 = 36
   \]
   The price in January is $36.

So, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 each. So, for these lessons, he makes:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he has 2 lessons for veterans at a reduced rate. The reduced rate is 25% less than $80, so:
\[ 80 - (80 \times 0.25) = 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ dollars per lesson} \]

For the 2 veteran lessons, he makes:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in total for the day, we add the money from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons:
\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:
\[ \boxed{440} \]"
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her scores and then divide by the number of scores she got.

First, let's add up all her scores: 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60.

Adding these step by step:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

So, the total sum of her scores is 630.

Now, we count the number of scores she got, which is 9.

To find the mean, we divide the total sum by the number of scores:
Mean = 630 ÷ 9 = 70

So, Sally's mean score is 70.

The correct answer is \boxed{70}."
"Eve originally had 20 pomelos. After giving some away, she has 1/4 of them left, which is 5 pomelos. To find out how many she gave away, we subtract the number she has left from the original number:

20 (original number) - 5 (number left) = 15 (number given away)

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos. The answer is 15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many he ate, we do:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, he ate 24 apples. Now, we subtract the apples he ate from the total:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, he gave 25% of the remaining apples to his sister. To find out how many that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, he gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, we subtract the apples he gave to his sister from the remaining apples:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Finally, he sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he got, we multiply:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Walter received 81 dollars. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{81}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Regina wrote 9 novels last year. The problem says that 9 is 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. 

To find out how many novels she wrote this year, we can set up the equation:
\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{number of novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels this year, we need to divide 9 by \(\frac{3}{4}\). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So, we multiply 9 by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year. The answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"To find out what percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we first need to know how far he travels in 3 days. If he travels at 50 km/hr, we need to know how many hours he travels in 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are 72 hours.

If he travels 50 km in one hour, in 72 hours he will travel:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Now, we need to find out what part of the total distance (6000 km) this 3600 km represents. We do this by dividing 3600 by 6000 and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:
\[ \left( \frac{3600}{6000} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas. The answer is:
\[ 60\% \]"
"To find out how many grapes were there at the beginning, let's break it down step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie uses 12 grapes. So, for 4 pies, she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. To find out how many grapes were there at the beginning, we add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother to the grapes used for the pies: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

So, there were 84 grapes at the beginning. The correct answer is 84."
"To find out how many teachers were at school, we start with the total number of teachers, which is 82. Out of these, 13 were sick, so we subtract those from the total. That leaves us with 82 - 13 = 69 teachers. Then, 9 substitute teachers came in to help. So, we add those 9 to the 69 teachers who were not sick.

69 + 9 = 78

So, the number of teachers at school that day was 78. The correct answer is 78."
"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how much Bud spends on making it each week. Here's what we know:
- The pasta costs $1.00.
- The cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- The gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, so it costs $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add up these costs to find out how much Bud spends each week:
- $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Bud makes this macaroni and cheese once a week, so in one year (which has 52 weeks), he spends:
- $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

So, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is $520.00."
"To find out what percentage of their day the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total time required to clean all the classrooms.

The custodian has to clean 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes for each classroom. So, the total time needed is:
\[ 80 \times 15 = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert this time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find out what percentage of their day they spend cleaning, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total cleaning time}}{\text{Workday time}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

So, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms. This means they spend more than one full workday cleaning the classrooms in the given 5 days.

The final answer is:
\[ 250\% \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Elly has 110 books to organize. She has bookcases with shelves that can hold books like this:

- The bottom shelf can hold 20 books.
- Each of the middle shelves can hold 10 books.
- The top shelf can hold 15 books.

So, if we add up the capacity of all the shelves in one bookcase:
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Middle shelf 1: 10 books
- Middle shelf 2: 10 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

Total capacity of one bookcase = 20 + 10 + 10 + 15 = 55 books.

Now, to find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
- 110 books ÷ 55 books per bookcase = 2 bookcases.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books. The answer is 2."

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The eggs cost her $2.40 for each dozen. So for 5 dozens, she spent:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, she will make:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much profit she makes, we subtract the cost from the selling price:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

Skyler has 100 hats in total. Half of these hats are red, so he has 50 red hats.

After taking out the red hats, he has 50 hats left. Out of these 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. So, he has 3/5 * 50 = 30 blue hats.

The rest of the hats are white. So, the number of white hats is 50 (remaining hats) - 30 (blue hats) = 20 white hats.

Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and it usually costs $18.00. But now, it's $3.00 off, so the bag now costs $15.00.

Now, we need to find out how much each stick costs. There are 30 sticks in a bag, and the bag now costs $15.00.

To find out how much each stick costs, we divide $15.00 by 30 sticks:
\[ 15.00 \div 30 = 0.50 \]

So, each stick costs $0.50. Since we need the answer in cents, we know that $0.50 is the same as 50 cents.

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky in cents is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, Audrey needs to get 70% of the total questions right to pass. The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110. So, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right, which is 110 * 0.70 = 77 questions.

On the first test, she got 60% of 70 questions right. So, she got 70 * 0.60 = 42 questions right.

To find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she got right on the first test from the total number of questions she needs to get right. So, 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to pass. The answer is 35."
"Mary made some strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. The total number of ice cubes is 116.

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \). Then the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, the number of strawberry cubes is 20. Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes:
\[ 5S - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96.

The correct answer is 96."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Ara has been playing 40 games every year for 4 years. So, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Now, she scores 21 points in each game. So, the total points she has scored is:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is:
\[ \boxed{3360} \]"
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he came up with 3 marbles, he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. But one of the marbles he found was not a marble, it was a bead, so he got rid of that. So he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The number of marbles Brendan ended up with is 7. 

The options to choose from are:
A) 5
B) 6
C) 7
D) 8

So the correct answer is C) 7."
"To find out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer to come to the dealership. To sell 15 cars, he needs 8 customers because 15 cars divided by 2 cars per customer equals 7.5, and we round up to 8 customers.

Now, to get 8 customers, we need to do 25 telephone calls for each customer. So, we multiply 25 by 8:

25 calls/customer × 8 customers = 200 calls

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars. The answer is 200."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

They have 4 people in the house, and each person gets 2 flashlights. So, the total number of flashlights is:
\[ 4 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ flashlights per person} = 8 \text{ flashlights} \]

Now, let's look at the candles:
- There are 8 rooms in the house.
- Half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each.
- The other half (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.

For the 4 rooms with small candles:
\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ candles per room} = 16 \text{ small candles} \]

For the 4 rooms with medium candles:
\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ candles per room} = 20 \text{ medium candles} \]

So, the total number of candles is:
\[ 16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles} \]

Now, adding the flashlights and candles together:
\[ 8 \text{ flashlights} + 36 \text{ candles} = 44 \]

So, the total number of candles and flashlights is 44. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{44}

"Mitchell bought two bags of chips, and each bag has 55 chips. So, he has a total of 2 times 55 chips, which is 110 chips. His family has 5 members, and they want to share the chips equally. To find out how many chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members.

So, we do 110 chips divided by 5 people, which equals 22 chips per person.

The answer is: 22 chips per person."
"To find out how long it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to add up the time he spends on each side.

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
- The third side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes another 10 minutes.
- The fourth side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(0.5 \times 5 = 2.5\) minutes.
- The fifth side also takes half as long as the first side, so it takes another 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add all these times together:
\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

We know there are 20 helmets. The problem says there are half as many robots as helmets, so we divide the number of helmets by 2 to find the number of robots:
\[ \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, the problem also says there are half as many helmets as footballs. So, we need to find out how many footballs there are by doubling the number of helmets:
\[ \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Now, to find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together:
\[ \text{Total number of items} = 10 \text{ (robots)} + 20 \text{ (helmets)} + 40 \text{ (footballs)} = 70 \]

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"Tim works 6 hours a day at his job. That's 6 x 60 = 360 minutes a day because there are 60 minutes in an hour. He spends 15 minutes on each call.

To find out how many calls he can handle in a day, we divide the total minutes he works in a day by the time it takes to handle one call: 360 / 15 = 24 calls a day.

Now, if he works 5 days a week, we multiply the number of calls he handles in a day by 5: 24 calls/day x 5 days/week = 120 calls/week.

So, the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week is 120. The answer is 120."
"To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish, we can follow these steps:

First, we calculate the drying time for 6 paintings using the old varnish:
- It takes 7 minutes for one painting to dry.
- So for 6 paintings, it would take \(7 \times 6 = 42\) minutes.

Next, we calculate the drying time for 6 paintings using the new varnish:
- It takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.
- So for 6 paintings, it would take \(12 \times 6 = 72\) minutes.

Now, we find the difference in drying times:
- The difference is \(72 - 42 = 30\) minutes.

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Crista has 20 plants in total. Some of these plants need different amounts of water each day.

- 4 plants need half a cup of water each day. So, for these plants, Crista needs \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups of water.
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water each day. So, for these plants, Crista needs \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups of water.
- The rest of the plants need a quarter of a cup of water each day. Since Crista has 20 plants in total and 4 + 8 = 12 plants have been accounted for, the rest are \(20 - 12 = 8\) plants. So, for these plants, Crista needs \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups of water.

Now, let's add up all the water needed:
- Water for the first group: 2 cups
- Water for the second group: 8 cups
- Water for the third group: 2 cups

So, the total water Crista needs every day is \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups.

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{12}\) cups of water."
"To find out how long it will take Phineas to return home, we need to break his journey into two parts: hopping on land and swimming in water. The total distance is 200 yards, so half of that is 100 yards for each part of the journey.

Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute. To hop 100 yards, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, Phineas swims in water at a speed of 10 yards per minute. To swim 100 yards, we use the same formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for hopping and swimming to find the total time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Phineas 15 minutes to return home. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. Each box has 8 popsicle sticks and costs $2.00. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of sticks by the number of sticks in each box:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ sticks}}{8 \text{ sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$14.00 \]

So, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00. The answer is:

\(\boxed{14}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the main phone costs $20. The problem says the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. So, if the main phone costs $20, each additional phone must cost half of that. 

\[ \text{Cost of each additional phone} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

There are five phones in total, and one of them is the main phone. So, there are four additional phones. 

\[ \text{Total cost of additional phones} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones.

\[ \text{Total cost of the whole phone plan} = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

So, the total cost of the whole phone plan is $60. 

The correct answer is: **60**"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

First, we calculate how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. He makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and since one dozen is 12 doughnuts, we do:

\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts he makes in June is:

\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Each doughnut is sold for $2, so the total money he makes is:

\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total money Derrick makes in June is $7200. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{7200} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Jade took 210 photos. She wants to upload them on Instagram. She can upload 7 photos in one batch, and she does 6 batches each day.

First, we need to find out how many photos she can upload in one day. She uploads 6 batches each day, and each batch has 7 photos. So, we multiply 6 by 7:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Now, we know she can upload 42 photos each day. To find out how many days she needs to upload all 210 photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload each day:
\[ 210 \div 42 = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need \(\boxed{5}\) days to upload all of her photos."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for easier understanding.

Alicia has clothes to send to the dry cleaners every week. Here's what she has:
- 5 blouses
- 2 pairs of pants
- 1 skirt

The dry cleaners charge:
- $5.00 for each blouse
- $6.00 for each skirt
- $8.00 for each pair of pants

First, we calculate the cost for each type of clothing for one week:
- Cost for blouses: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 \text{ per blouse} = \$25.00\)
- Cost for pants: \(2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 \text{ per pair} = \$16.00\)
- Cost for skirt: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 \text{ per skirt} = \$6.00\)

Now, we add these costs together to find the total cost for one week:
\[
\$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00
\]

Alicia needs to pay this amount every week. If we want to know how much she pays in 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
\[
\$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00
\]

So, Alicia spends \(\boxed{235.00}\) on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

John's normal speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, he can talk 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:
\[ 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages, so the total number of words is:
\[ 10 \times 450 = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, to find out how long it takes him to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM, we divide the total words by his new speed:
\[ \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take him 12 minutes to speak 10 pages. The answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step in a simpler way.

1. On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.
2. On the second day, 20 more people were there than on the first day. So, the number of people on the second day is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. On the third day, the number of people was twice the number on the second day. So, the number of people on the third day is:
   \[
   2 \times 70 = 140
   \]
4. For the rest of the week (fourth, fifth, and sixth days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. So, the total number of people for these three days is:
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180
   \]
5. Now, we add up all the people Conor saw over the week:
   \[
   50 + 70 + 140 + 180 = 440
   \]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 440. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{440}

"Let's break down the popcorn popping step by step:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the total number of kernels that popped is:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"Tim wants to make lemonade for a party. His recipe says he needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice for every gallon of lemonade. He needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade, so he needs:
\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart. This extra gallon also needs 1 cup of lemon juice.

So, the total lemon juice needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups} \]

Since each cup of lemon juice needs 6 lemons, Tim needs:
\[ 5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, Tim needs \(\boxed{30}\) lemons."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

The kennel has 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food a day, and each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of dog food a day.

First, let's find out how much dog food the German Shepherds eat in a day:
- 3 German Shepherds × 5 kg each = 15 kg

Next, let's find out how much dog food the Bulldogs eat in a day:
- 2 Bulldogs × 3 kg each = 6 kg

Now, let's add the dog food eaten by the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs in a day:
- 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

This means the kennel needs 21 kg of dog food per day. To find out how much they need for a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7:
- 21 kg/day × 7 days = 147 kg

So, the kennel needs 147 kg of dog food in a week. The correct answer is 147 kg."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. We have 10 animals that are 2-legged. So, if we multiply 10 by 2, we get 20 legs from these animals.
2. We also have 15 animals that are 4-legged. So, if we multiply 15 by 4, we get 60 legs from these animals.
3. Now, we add the legs from both types of animals: 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs in total.
4. Since we need to know how many pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2: 80 legs ÷ 2 = 40 pairs.

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40. The answer is \boxed{40}."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the tower has:
- 4 blue blocks
- Twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so 8 yellow blocks
- An unknown number of red blocks

The total number of blocks is 32.

First, let's add the blue and yellow blocks together:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 8 \text{ (yellow)} = 12 \text{ blocks} \]

Now, we subtract this number from the total number of blocks to find out how many red blocks there are:
\[ 32 \text{ (total blocks)} - 12 \text{ (blue and yellow blocks)} = 20 \text{ red blocks} \]

So, the number of red blocks is 20.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in both directions and then find the difference.

Elvis drove west for 5 hours at 18 mph. So, the distance he traveled west is:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ mph} = 90 \text{ miles} \]

Then, he drove east for 8 hours at 18 mph. So, the distance he traveled east is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ mph} = 144 \text{ miles} \]

Since he drove west first and then east, the net distance from his house is the difference between the distance he traveled east and the distance he traveled west:
\[ 144 \text{ miles} - 90 \text{ miles} = 54 \text{ miles} \]

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now. The answer is:
54 miles"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the boat's depreciation.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   - The boat originally costs $9000.
   - It loses 30% of its value in the first year.
   - So, it loses $9000 * 0.30 = $2700.
   - After the first year, the boat is worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   - In the second year, the boat loses another 30% of its value.
   - So, it loses $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.
   - After the second year, the boat is worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   - In the third year, the boat loses 20% of its value.
   - So, it loses $4410 * 0.20 = $882.
   - After the third year, the boat is worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

So, after three years, the boat is worth **$3528**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We know the bag has 232 pieces of Starbursts candy. We also know there are 54 red candies. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so that's 54 * 2 = 108 orange candies. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so that's 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189 candies.

To find out how many are pink, we subtract the total of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 (total) - 189 (red, orange, yellow) = 43 pink candies.

So, the number of pink candies is 43."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the trip.

First, we know Helen stayed in a hotel for 3 nights. Each night costs $80. So, for 3 nights, the cost is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]
So, the hotel cost is $240.

Next, Helen rode the bus 7 times. Each bus trip costs 10% of the hotel cost. So, the cost of one bus trip is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \]
So, each bus trip costs $8. For 7 trips, the total cost is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]
So, the bus cost is $56.

Now, to find the total cost for the trip, we add the hotel cost and the bus cost:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \]

So, Helen paid a total of $296 for the hotel and bus travels during the trip. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"

"To find out how many feet of crepe paper James needs, we first need to know the total length of the fence. The fence is a rectangle, so we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

The length of the fence is 20 feet and the width is 15 feet. So we add the length and the width together:

\[ 20 + 15 = 35 \]

Then we multiply by 2:

\[ 2 \times 35 = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To find the average age of Mia and Emma, we first need to know Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and they are 16 years apart in age, and Mia is younger, Emma must be 40 + 16 = 56 years old.

Now, to find the average of their ages, we add their ages together and then divide by 2:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48 \]

So, the average of their ages is 48.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{48} \]"
"To find out how many good seashells they found together, we first add up all the seashells they found:

Tom found 214 seashells.
Nancy found 432 seashells.
Benny found 86 seashells.

So, we add these numbers together:
\[ 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 \]

They found a total of 732 seashells. But they discovered that 67 of these were cracked. So, to find out how many good seashells they have, we subtract the cracked seashells from the total:
\[ 732 - 67 = 665 \]

So, the number of good seashells they found together is 665. The correct answer is 665."
"Avery needs to buy a 3-piece place setting for her holiday dinner. This place setting includes a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl. The dinner plate costs $6.00, the salad plate costs $4.00, and the bowl costs $5.00.

First, let's find out how much one 3-piece place setting costs:
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

Adding these together:
\[ 6.00 + 4.00 + 5.00 = 15.00 \]

So, one 3-piece place setting costs $15.00.

Now, Avery is having 12 people over for dinner. To find out how much she will spend in total, we multiply the cost of one place setting by the number of people:
\[ 15.00 \times 12 = 180.00 \]

Therefore, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings.

The final answer is: **$180.00**"
"To find out how long it took Anna to finish the puzzle, we start with the time Steve took, which is 10 hours.

Half of Steve's time is:
\[
10 \div 2 = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Anna took 2 more hours than that, so:
\[
5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the puzzle. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Dexter has 5 pigs, and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. So, each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, for 5 pigs:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

In a week (7 days), the total feed eaten by all pigs is:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. So, the amount of feed left after a week is:
\[ 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

John invited 20 people to a party and each person will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/person} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs from a previous party. So, he needs to buy:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2. To find out how many packs he needs to buy, we divide the number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs in each pack:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Now, to find out how much he needs to spend, we multiply the number of packs by the cost of each pack:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Frances.

First, we calculate how much money Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies:
- She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so she makes \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars from cupcakes.
- She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so she makes \(40 \times 1 = 40\) dollars from cookies.
- Adding these together, she makes \(40 + 40 = 80\) dollars in total.

Next, we calculate how much money she spends on the trays of cookies:
- She buys 5 trays at $4 each, so she spends \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars on the trays.

Now, to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the money she spent from the money she made:
- She made $80 and spent $20, so she has \(80 - 20 = 60\) dollars left.

So, the amount of money Frances has left is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. On the first street, there are 5 children.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child. So, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. So, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

By the time the truck reaches the end of the third street, there are 30 children following it. Then, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, the number of children remaining is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

The final number of children following the truck is 25.

So, the answer is 25."
"To find out how many meals Mamou has left to give out, we need to subtract the meals she has already given from the total meals she planned to give.

First, let's add up the meals she gave out:
- On Friday, she gave out 64 meals.
- On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals.
- On Sunday, she gave out 48 meals.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has given out 142 meals in total.

Next, we need to find out how many meals are left. She was supposed to give out 1,360 meals. So, we subtract the meals she has already given from the total meals:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, the number of meals left for Mamou to give out is 1,218.

The correct answer is 1,218."
"James finds a quarter, which is 25 cents. He also finds two nickels. Each nickel is 5 cents, so two nickels are 2 times 5 cents, which is 10 cents. He finds seven dimes. Each dime is 10 cents, so seven dimes are 7 times 10 cents, which is 70 cents.

Now, let's add all these up:
- 25 cents (quarter) + 10 cents (nickels) + 70 cents (dimes) = 105 cents.

So, James has 105 cents in total. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{105}
\]"
"To find the total age of all the siblings, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old. So, the total age of the sisters is:
   \[
   3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ years}
   \]

2. One of the brothers is 12 years old. The older brother is twice the age of the younger brother, so the older brother is:
   \[
   12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. Now, we add the ages of all the siblings together:
   \[
   48 \text{ (sisters)} + 12 \text{ (younger brother)} + 24 \text{ (older brother)} = 84 \text{ years}
   \]

So, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years. The correct answer is 84."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night. So, she meditates for 30 minutes each day. She does this 5 days a week. So, in one week, she meditates for 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes. Over 4 weeks, she meditates for 150 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 600 minutes.

She also does yoga for 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) each day. She does yoga 5 days a week. So, in one week, she does yoga for 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes. Over 4 weeks, she does yoga for 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes.

Now, to find out how much time she spends on both meditation and yoga in 4 weeks, we add the time she spends on meditation and the time she spends on yoga. So, 600 minutes (meditation) + 1200 minutes (yoga) = 1800 minutes.

To convert 1800 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 because 60 minutes make 1 hour. So, 1800 minutes / 60 = 30 hours.

Therefore, the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga in 4 weeks is 30 hours."
"To find out how many square feet the quilt is, we need to add up the square feet from all the t-shirts Octavia is using.

First, we calculate the square feet from the small t-shirts:
- Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
- Octavia uses 11 small t-shirts.
- So, \( 11 \times 3 = 33 \) square feet from the small t-shirts.

Next, we calculate the square feet from the medium t-shirts:
- Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
- Octavia uses 8 medium t-shirts.
- So, \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \) square feet from the medium t-shirts.

Then, we calculate the square feet from the large t-shirts:
- Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
- Octavia uses 6 large t-shirts.
- So, \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) square feet from the large t-shirts.

Now, we add up all the square feet:
- \( 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 \) square feet.

So, the quilt is 101 square feet. The answer is 101."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen is 12, a small sunflower has:
   \[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

2. A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find 50% of 36 seeds:
   \[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

3. So, a large sunflower has:
   \[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

4. Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower:
   \[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is 90. The correct answer is 90."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Sarah's pens.

We know George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times as many pens as George, so:

\[
\text{Timothy's pens} = 3 \times 18 = 54
\]

Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so:

\[
\text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Albert is 36 inches tall.
2. Anne is twice as tall as Albert, so Anne is \(2 \times 36 = 72\) inches tall.
3. Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie is \(72 - 2 = 70\) inches tall now.
4. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer to reach 70 inches, so before the summer, she was \(70 - 3 = 67\) inches tall.

So, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer. The answer is 67 inches."
"To find out how much money the company will get for selling chocolate bars in two weeks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the company makes 5000 chocolate bars each day. In one week, which has 7 days, they make:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35000 \text{ bars/week} \]

Now, for two weeks, they will make:
\[ 35000 \text{ bars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Since they sell each bar for $2, the total money they will get is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the company will receive 140000 dollars. The correct answer is 140000."
"Jake buys 2 T-shirts at $8 each, but he gets the second one at 50% off. So, the first T-shirt costs $8 and the second T-shirt costs $8 * 0.5 = $4. That means the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price of $40. So, he pays 60% of $40, which is $40 * 0.6 = $24.

Adding the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes together, Jake spends $12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36. The answer is C."
"Ryan earns $6 for each week he does his chores. If he does his chores for 3 weeks, he earns:

\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, Ryan buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so for 4 people, the cost is:

\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the ice cream cones, Ryan has:

\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ryan wants to buy movie tickets that cost $6.50 each. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the money he has by the cost of one movie ticket:

\[ 13 \div 6.5 = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for easier understanding.

Ellen bought:
- Leggings for $100
- A photo frame for $5

So, Ellen spent $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought:
- Sunglasses for $30
- Two bathrobes, each costing $100, so 2 * $100 = $200

So, Lani spent $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, to find out how much they spent in all, we add what Ellen spent and what Lani spent:
$105 + $230 = $335.

So, the total amount they spent is $335."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his mix.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to make one jar of the mix. Here's how we do it:

- For 1 jar, Tim needs 2 pounds of passion fruit. Passion fruit costs $6 per pound.
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- For 1 jar, Tim needs 1.5 pounds of jackfruit. Jackfruit costs $8 per pound.
  \[
  1.5 \text{ pounds} \times 8 \text{ dollars/pound} = 12 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- For 1 jar, Tim needs 2 pounds of special honey. Honey costs $10 per pound.
  \[
  2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we add up all the costs for one jar:
\[
12 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} + 20 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, it costs $44 to make one jar of the mix. If Tim sells 10 jars, the total cost for 10 jars is:
\[
44 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 440 \text{ dollars}
\]

Tim sells each jar for $50. So, the total money he makes from selling 10 jars is:
\[
50 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 500 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total money made:
\[
500 \text{ dollars} - 440 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $60. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To find the total amount of money in the jar, we need to add up the value of all the coins Justin has.

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- Quarters: Justin has 32 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25. So, the total value of the quarters is \(32 \times 0.25 = 8\) dollars.
- Dimes: Justin has 95 dimes. Each dime is worth $0.10. So, the total value of the dimes is \(95 \times 0.10 = 9.50\) dollars.
- Nickels: Justin has 120 nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05. So, the total value of the nickels is \(120 \times 0.05 = 6\) dollars.
- Pennies: Justin has 750 pennies. Each penny is worth $0.01. So, the total value of the pennies is \(750 \times 0.01 = 7.50\) dollars.

Now, we add up all these values:
\[8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31\]

So, the total amount of money in the jar is $31.00.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{31.00}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Janet spent money on three things:
1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets: $7.50 each for herself and her sister, so that's $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
3. Bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add up all the money she spent:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from $40:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, Janet has $13.00 left. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{13.00} \]"
"Josh works 5 days a week because he doesn't work on Sunday and Wednesday. If he services 3 cars each day, then in one week he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

He gets paid $4 for each car he services. So, in one week, he makes:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

For 2 weeks, he makes:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount Josh makes in 2 weeks is $120. The correct answer is:

"Let's count the cookies step by step:

1. Randy starts with:
   - 9 oatmeal cookies
   - 4 chocolate chip cookies
   - 5 sugar cookies

2. He eats 1 oatmeal, 1 chocolate chip, and 1 sugar cookie for an early snack:
   - Oatmeal cookies left: \(9 - 1 = 8\)
   - Chocolate chip cookies left: \(4 - 1 = 3\)
   - Sugar cookies left: \(5 - 1 = 4\)

3. He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch:
   - Oatmeal cookies left: \(8 - 2 = 6\)

4. He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends:
   - Sugar cookies left: \(4 - 2 = 2\)

5. He bakes 4 oatmeal, 4 chocolate chip, and 4 sugar cookies for dinner:
   - Oatmeal cookies now: \(6 + 4 = 10\)
   - Chocolate chip cookies now: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
   - Sugar cookies now: \(2 + 4 = 6\)

Now, let's add up all the cookies he has now:
- Oatmeal cookies: 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 7
- Sugar cookies: 6

Total cookies: \(10 + 7 + 6 = 23\)

So, Randy has 23 cookies now. The correct answer is 23."
"Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He wants to sell them to a buyer who will pay $5 for half of the soldiers and $7 for the other half.

First, we find out how many soldiers are in each half:
- Half of 12 is 6 soldiers.

Now, we calculate the money from each half:
- For the first half (6 soldiers at $5 each):
  \[
  6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- For the second half (6 soldiers at $7 each):
  \[
  6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ dollars}
  \]

To find the total money Matthew will earn, we add the money from both halves:
\[
30 + 42 = 72 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Matthew will earn 72 dollars. The correct answer is:
\boxed{72}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

1. First, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate is on vacation for 14 days. So, the dog digs:
   \[
   6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. When Nate comes back, the dog keeps digging 6 holes a day, but Nate fills 9 holes a day. So, the net change in holes per day is:
   \[
   9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes. Since the dog and Nate together fill 3 holes each day, we divide the total number of holes by the net change per day:
   \[
   \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}
   \]

4. Finally, we need to find out how many weeks it takes. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of days by 7:
   \[
   \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

Norman High School has about 4000 students. Butler High School has 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. To find out how many students Butler High School has, we do:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \]

So, Butler High School has 3000 students.

Now, to find out how much greater Norman High School's enrollment is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number at Norman High School:

\[ 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

So, Norman High School has 1000 more students than Butler High School.

The final answer is 1000."
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

First, let's add the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies:
\[ 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

Now, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies:
\[ 7995 - 5670 = 2325 \]

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies they made is 2325.

\[ \text{2325} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to get:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

Igor got:
- Half as many test tubes as asked, so he got 8 test tubes.
- Two more Petri dishes than asked, so he got 16 Petri dishes.
- The same number of beakers as asked, so he got 7 beakers.

Now, let's count the total items Igor got:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

Total items Igor got: \(8 + 7 + 16 = 31\)

Dr. Grumpus asked for:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

Total items Dr. Grumpus asked for: \(16 + 7 + 14 = 37\)

So, Igor lost some items. The total items he lost is: \(37 - 31 = 6\)

Since Igor got 7 beakers and lost a total of 6 items, he must have lost 1 beaker.

The number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

James is making 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs. So, for 4 tables, he needs:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 16 \text{ legs} \]

Each leg needs 2 screws, so for 16 legs, he needs:
\[ 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left, we subtract the screws he needs from the screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, James will have 8 screws left over. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

So, the second basket has 20 eggs.

Now, to find out how many eggs are in both baskets together, we add the eggs from both baskets:

\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

- Alexandra raised $430.
- Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so she raised $430 + $320 = $750.
- Sarah raised $300.
- Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so she raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, to find out how much they all raised in total, we add up all these amounts:
- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

So, $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180.

Therefore, the total amount of money they raised is $2180."
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

Aaron and Vanessa were partners in a race. Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa. If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron took 16 minutes to finish his part, we need to find out how long Vanessa took.

First, we know Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed. If Aaron took 16 minutes to run 4 miles, we can figure out how fast Aaron was running.

Since Aaron ran 4 miles in 16 minutes, his speed is:
\[ \text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = 0.25 \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since Aaron's speed is twice Vanessa's speed, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Speed of Vanessa} = \frac{0.25 \text{ miles per minute}}{2} = 0.125 \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, Vanessa ran 4 miles. To find out how long it took her, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time Vanessa took is:
\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{0.125 \text{ miles per minute}} = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Right now, there are 200 feet of dock, so he needs:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

He already has 6 feet of new line. So, the line he needs to buy is:

\[ 600 \text{ feet} - 6 \text{ feet} = 594 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{594} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. They order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine for each reservation. We need to find out how much they make in a week if they are open 2 days a week.

First, let's find out how much one reservation costs:
- 2 meals at $5 each cost $10.
- Plus a $5 bottle of wine.
- So, one reservation costs $10 + $5 = $15.

Now, they get 6 reservations a night. If they are open 2 days a week, they get:
- 6 reservations/night × 2 nights/week = 12 reservations/week.

If each reservation costs $15, then in a week they make:
- 12 reservations/week × $15/reservation = $180.

So, the amount they make in a week is $180. The correct answer is:

\boxed{180}"
"The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold them at a 25% profit. To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price.

The cost price of the watermelons is $80. A 25% profit means he made an extra $80 * 0.25 = $20 on the total cost. So, the total selling price is $80 + $20 = $100.

Now, to find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons. So, $100 ÷ 50 = $2.

Each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. James is 18 years old now.
2. Dora is 9 years old now because she will be 12 in 3 years.
3. James is twice as old as Dora, so Dora is half of James's age, which is 9.
4. John is 18 years older than James, so John is 18 + 18 = 36 years old now.
5. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the son is 36 - 32 = 4 years old now.
6. In 3 years, the son will be 4 + 3 = 7 years old.

So, the youngest son will be 7 years old in 3 years. The correct answer is 7."
"To find out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to figure out how many oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's see how many oranges Ana can peel in one minute. Since it takes her 3 minutes to peel one orange, in one minute she can peel \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.

Next, let's see how many oranges Jane can peel in one minute. Since it takes her 4 minutes to peel one orange, in one minute she can peel \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Now, we need to find out how many oranges each can peel in 60 minutes (which is an hour).

For Ana:
- In 60 minutes, she can peel \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.

For Jane:
- In 60 minutes, she can peel \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana peeled than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number of oranges Ana peeled:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\).

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The answer is: \boxed{5}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The original cost of a new radiator is $400.
2. Mark gets it at 80% off. So, he only pays 20% of $400.
3. To find 20% of $400, we calculate:
   \[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]
   So, the radiator costs $80.
4. Now, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours.
5. The cost for the mechanic is:
   \[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]
6. Adding the cost of the radiator and the mechanic's charge:
   \[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, Mark paid $230 in total. The correct answer is $230."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have 20 animals in total, and they have 70 legs altogether. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each.

First, let's think about how many legs we would have if all 20 animals were chickens. If all 20 animals were chickens, they would have:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ legs} \]

But we know they actually have 70 legs, so there must be some cows in there. If we add cows, each cow gives us 2 extra legs (4 legs for the cow minus 2 legs for the chicken). So, we need 30 more legs to make up the difference:
\[ 70 - 40 = 30 \text{ legs} \]

Since each cow gives us 2 extra legs, we can find out how many cows there are by dividing the extra legs by 2:
\[ 30 \div 2 = 15 \text{ cows} \]

Now, we know there are 15 cows, and the total number of animals is 20. So, the number of chickens is:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many slices each person can have, we first need to know the total number of pizza slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, we multiply 7 by 8 to get the total number of slices:

\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we have 56 slices to share among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. To find out how many slices each person gets, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \div 4 = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
