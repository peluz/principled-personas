"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks per day, which is 16 eggs.
2. Subtract the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast, which is 3 eggs. This leaves us with \(16 - 3 = 13\) eggs.
3. Subtract the number of eggs used to bake muffins, which is 4 eggs. This leaves us with \(13 - 4 = 9\) eggs.
4. Since Janet sells each remaining egg for $2, the total amount she makes is \(9 \times 2 = 18\) dollars.

Therefore, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of each type of fiber required and then sum them up.

1. **Blue Fiber:**
   - The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. **White Fiber:**
   - The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.
   - Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
     \]

3. **Total Bolts of Fiber:**
   - Sum the bolts of blue and white fiber:
     \[
     2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
     \]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine Josh's profit, we first calculate the total cost of the house after the repairs. The initial cost of the house is $80,000, and he adds $50,000 in repairs, making the total cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The value of the house increases by 150% due to the repairs and subsequent work. To find the increase in value, we calculate 150% of the total cost:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the total cost gives the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost from the new value:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To determine the total distance James runs in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one session (3 sprints):**
   Since he runs 3 sprints each time, the total distance for one session is:
   \[
   60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance James runs in one week:**
   James runs 3 times a week, so the total distance for one week is:
   \[
   180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is:
\[

"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:**
   - Morning feed: 15 cups
   - Afternoon feed: 25 cups
   - Total feed for morning and afternoon: \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups

2. **Determine the total amount of feed needed for the entire day:**
   - Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day.
   - She has 20 chickens.
   - Total feed for the day: \( 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \)

3. **Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   - Total feed for the day: 60 cups
   - Feed given in the morning and afternoon: 40 cups
   - Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \)

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is 20.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost for every second glass:
- The cost of the first glass is $5.
- The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
- The cost of the third glass is $5.
- The cost of the fourth glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
- This pattern continues for every second glass.

We can see that for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can group them into 8 pairs (since 16 divided by 2 is 8).

The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle given the relationships between the number of sheep in each city.

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: We are given that Seattle has 20 sheep.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 20
   \]

2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep in Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]

4. **Total Sheep**: To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we sum the number of sheep in each city.
   \[
   \text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is:
\[
\boxed{260}

"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we can break down the process into three segments:

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update and restart:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each part:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update and restart: 20 minutes
- Time for the remaining download: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered: \( 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered: \( 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining: \( 4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \).
   - Distance covered: \( 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Now, we sum up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Earnings from regular hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   - Overtime rate = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour.
   - Earnings from overtime = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime.

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the lemon tree is $90.
2. **Revenue per Year**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue per year is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year}
   \]
3. **Cost per Year**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit per year is the revenue minus the cost:
\[
\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year}
\]

Since the initial cost of $90 is a one-time expense, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost. We set up the equation:
\[
7.5 \times \text{number of years} = 90
\]

Solving for the number of years:
\[
\text{number of years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to consider her earnings from both teaching and coaching.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

"To determine the original price of the book, we start with the information that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after receiving a 25% discount. This means that $19.50 represents 75% of the original price. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

Given that 75% of the original price is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Performing the division:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26 \]

Thus, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final numerical answer is:

12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[
50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[
\frac{17}{8.50} = 2
\]

Thus, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $59.50.

2. **Cost of pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50.

3. **Cost of shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.00.

Now, we sum up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00

Adding these amounts:
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

Thus, Mishka spent a total of $253.00 on all the clothing items.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{253}

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can break down the trip into segments:

1. The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
2. The first stop is made after 20 miles, so the distance traveled before the first stop is 20 miles.
3. The second stop is made 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles long, the second stop is at 60 - 15 = 45 miles from the start.
4. The distance traveled between the first and second stops is the difference between the distance at the second stop and the distance at the first stop: 45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles.

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 25 miles.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"To determine the cost of the boots, we start by defining the cost of the boots as \( B \). We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is $66. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:

\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:

\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Darrell and Allen in terms of a variable. Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. Given that their total age is 162, we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

To find the value of \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can determine the ages of Darrell and Allen. Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 years to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we start by determining each friend's individual guess based on the information provided:

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and adding 20 to 40 gives 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is 80 jelly beans. The correct answer is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To determine the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily time spent:**
   - Each dog requires 0.5 hours of care per day.
   - John takes care of 10 dogs.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per day is:
     \[
     0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weekly time spent:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent per week is:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

Thus, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( G = S + 30 \) (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)
2. \( G + S = 110 \) (since the total number of coins is 110)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know the number of silver coins \( S \) is 40, we can find the number of gold coins \( G \):

\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we start by finding out how many jewels Aaron has. The problem states that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Given that Raymond has 40 jewels, we first calculate half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Next, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. The problem then states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"To determine the total number of points Mike scored, we need to break down the problem into two segments based on the time he spent playing.

1. **First 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores 4 points.

2. **Second 20 minutes:**
   - He scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes. To find 25% of 4 points:
     \[
     0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point}
     \]
   - Therefore, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
     \[
     4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total points:**
   - Sum the points from both segments:
     \[
     4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points}
     \]

Thus, the total number of points Mike scored is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   \[
   \text{Total yogurts in 30 days} = 2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts}
   \]

2. **Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:**
   The yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{60 \, \text{yogurts}}{4 \, \text{yogurts/set}} = 15 \, \text{sets}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 15 sets:**
   Each set costs $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15 \, \text{sets} \times 5 \, \text{\$/set} = 75 \, \text{\$}
   \]

Thus, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"To determine how many lego sets John still has, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets:
   \[
   13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. Calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games:
   \[
   8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Determine the amount of money John has left after buying the video games:
   \[
   195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Since John has $5 left after buying the video games, the $35 he has left is the amount he had initially, which is the total amount he made from selling his lego sets. This confirms that he sold all 13 lego sets.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:

"To determine John's running speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and the total time he spends running.

Given that John runs 60 miles in a week and he runs 3 days a week, the distance he runs each day is:
\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

For the other two days, he runs half as much as the first day, which means:
\[ \text{Distance on other two days} = \frac{20 \text{ miles}}{2} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \]

The total time he spends running in a week is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find his running speed, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Therefore, John's running speed is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distances Dana can travel by running and walking, given her speeds and the time spent on each activity.

First, we know Dana can skip at a speed of 3 miles per hour. Since skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance traveled by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

Since the walking speed is one-fourth of the running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Running speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now we calculate the distance walked:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels by running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we can follow these steps:

1. **Suzy's iPhone Age**: We know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
   \[
   \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 1 \text{ year}
   \]

2. **Ben's iPhone Age**: Since Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Brandon's iPhone Age**: Given that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, we find:
   \[
   \text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:**
   - Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet.
   - With the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther: \( 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \).

2. **Compare this distance to the dragon's reach:**
   - The dragon's reach is 1000 feet.
   - To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin: \( 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \).

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, resulting in a total of \(5 \times 8 = 40\) pieces of pie. After the guests had their servings, there were 14 pieces remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

\[ 40 - 14 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat while staying within your daily calorie target, we start by calculating the calories per serving. Given that a 300g bag contains 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the calories per serving are:

\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 50 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Next, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume in a day. Your daily target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories are:

\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

To find out how many servings you can consume with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

\[ \text{Servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams of chips you can eat are:

\[ \text{Grams} = 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the number of grams of chips you can eat is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of making 20 candles:**
   - Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.
   - The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle is sold for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net profit:**
   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Net profit = $40 - $20 = $20.

Thus, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is \(\boxed{20}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we first need to calculate the number of articles she wrote each day and then sum the total hours spent writing.

1. **Monday:**
   Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.

2. **Tuesday:**
   On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. To find the number of articles written on Tuesday, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. To find the number of articles written on Wednesday, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14
   \]

Next, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
\[
\text{Total articles} = 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26
\]

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing articles over the three days is:
\[
\text{Total hours} = 26 \times 4 = 104
\]

Thus, the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days is:
\[

"To determine how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Post-it Notes**: Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.
2. **Post-it Notes Used**: She placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee, which means she used 220 Post-it notes.
3. **Remaining Post-it Notes**: After using 220 Post-it notes, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let \( x \) represent the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. The total number of Post-it notes used and remaining can be expressed as:
\[ 80 - 220 + x = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ -140 + x = 23 \]

To find \( x \), solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Thus, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"To determine the total amount John spent on ties, we start by calculating the number of blue ties he bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can find the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. Given that each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 + (0.50 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

The total cost of the red ties is then:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Adding the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties gives us the total amount John spent on ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot wire, we first convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, a 4-foot wire is equivalent to:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces she can obtain:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces Tracy obtained is \(\boxed{8}\)."

2. **Determine the number of occupied units:**
   - 3/4 of the building is occupied.
   - The number of occupied units is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \) units.

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units:**
   - The total number of units is 120.
   - The number of occupied units is 90.
   - Therefore, the number of unoccupied units is \( 120 - 90 = 30 \) units.

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day:**
   \[
   \text{Eggs per day} = 252
   \]

   \text{Dozens per day} = \frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 21 \text{ dozens}
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue per day:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue per day} = 21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars per dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the revenue per week:**
   \[
   \text{Revenue per week} = 42 \text{ dollars per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 294 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the time it takes for Tom to travel back, we need to consider the distance \( D \) he traveled to his destination. The time taken to travel distance \( D \) at 10 mph is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time to travel to the destination} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

After reaching his destination, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph. The time taken to travel back the same distance \( D \) at 6 mph is:

\[ \text{Time to travel back} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

The total time for the round trip is the sum of these two times:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{D}{10} + \frac{D}{6} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 6 is 30. So we rewrite the fractions:

\[ \frac{D}{10} = \frac{3D}{30} \]
\[ \frac{D}{6} = \frac{5D}{30} \]

Adding these fractions gives:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{3D}{30} + \frac{5D}{30} = \frac{8D}{30} = \frac{4D}{15} \text{ hours} \]

Since the problem does not specify the distance \( D \), the time it takes Tom to get back in terms of \( D \) is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{4D}{15}} \]"
"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we start by calculating the total weight of the comic books he removes. Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound, and he removes 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Thus, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to calculate the number of kittens each cat has had and then sum them up.

1. **Patchy's Kittens:**
   - Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
   - The adopted kittens are 7.
   - Therefore, Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

2. **Trixie's Kittens:**
   - Trixie has had 12 kittens.

3. **Total Kittens:**
   - Add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens Patchy and Trixie have had.
   - Total kittens = Adopted kittens + Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens
   - Total kittens = 7 + 21 + 12

Now, let's perform the addition:

\[
7 + 21 + 12 = 40
\]

Thus, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is \(\boxed{40}\)."

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the maximum allowable weight of the boxes:**
   The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum weight that can be added to the truck (the weight of the boxes) is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of boxes that can be loaded:**
   Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the maximum allowable weight of the boxes by the weight of one box:
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83
   \]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the pension structure over the duration of her employment.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Therefore, for the first 20 years, her total pension is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - Therefore, her pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000 per year:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - For the first 20 years, she earns $50,000 per year.
   - For the next 10 years, she earns $50,000 per year.
   - Therefore, her total annual pension after 30 years is:
     \[
     50,000 + 50,000 = 100,000 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

Thus, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is \(\boxed{100000}\)."
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the payments for each half of the year separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost for the first half of the year:**
   - There are 6 months in a half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 140 = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The second half of the year also has 6 months.
   - The charge for the second half is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - First, find 10% of $140:
     \[
     0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Subtract this 10% from the initial amount to get the reduced charge for the second half:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 126 = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year:**
   - Add the costs for the first and second halves of the year:
     \[
     840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars}

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **Level 4 (top level):**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = 16
   \]

2. **Level 3:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{16}{2} = 8

1. **First 180 days:**
   - The puppy consumes 1 cup of dog food per day.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \(1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups}\).

2. **Remaining days in the first year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days = \(365 \, \text{days} - 180 \, \text{days} = 185 \, \text{days}\).

3. **Dog food consumption for the remaining 185 days:**
   - The puppy consumes 2 cups of dog food per day.
   - Total dog food for the remaining 185 days = \(2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups}\).

4. **Total dog food needed for the first year:**
   - Total dog food for the first year = \(180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups}\).

5. **Number of bags of dog food needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups.
   - Number of bags needed = \(\frac{550 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = 5 \, \text{bags}\).

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the amount of laundry Sarah does, which is given as 400 pounds. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing 400 pounds by 4:

\[
\text{Laundry done by David} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Laundry done by Raymond} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does:

\[
\text{Difference} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}

"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each versus buying them in packages of 2 for $1 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- The total cost for 6 packages of 3 flowers is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- The total cost for 9 packages of 2 flowers is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9.00
  \]

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2: $9.00

Vincent saves more money by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2. The amount saved is:
\[
15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00
\]

Thus, the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is \(\boxed{6.00}\)."

\]

Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:

\[
4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we add the 6 liters of water that the boy received:

\[
8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

The initial total amount of water was 24 liters. Therefore, the amount of water left after the girls and the boy have taken their portions is:

\[
24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"Given that the football team played a total of 22 games and won 8 more games than they lost, we can set up the following equations to solve for the number of games won.

Let \( L \) represent the number of games lost and \( W \) represent the number of games won. According to the problem, we have:
\[ W = L + 8 \]
and
\[ W + L = 22 \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 7 \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games the team won is 15. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Time the Alarm Went Off:**
   - The alarm rang 4 times.

2. **Second Time the Alarm Went Off:**
   - It rang for three times as long as the first time.
   - Therefore, the second time it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.

3. **Third Time the Alarm Went Off:**
   - It rang for half as long as the second time.
   - Therefore, the third time it rang \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.

Now, we sum up the total number of times the alarm rang:

\[
4 \text{ (first time)} + 12 \text{ (second time)} + 6 \text{ (third time)} = 22
\]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang is \(\boxed{22}\)."

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.

2. **Annual Salary Increase**: The company increases the salary by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who have stayed for five years. Since Sylvie has just completed five years of service, she qualifies for this increase.

3. **Calculate the Increase**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]

4. **New Salary After First Year**:
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]

5. **Salary Increase for the Second Year**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66
   \]

6. **New Salary After Second Year**:
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$660 + \$66 = \$726
   \]

7. **Salary Increase for the Third Year**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$726 = 0.10 \times 726 = \$72.60
   \]

8. **New Salary After Third Year**:
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$726 + \$72.60 = \$798.60
   \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is \(\boxed{798.60}\)."
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald's record sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both records combined is given as 88,000. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we first calculate the potato salad consumption for the adults and the children separately.

For the adults:
- Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

For the children:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Adding the total potato salad needed for both the adults and the children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we can follow these steps:

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine Gerald's improved time for running the 400-meter hurdles after his speed improvement, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Calculate Lee's original speed:**
   Lee's speed \( S_L \) is:
   \[
   S_L = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

3. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   Since Lee is two seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald's original time \( T_G \) is:
   \[
   T_G = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Calculate Gerald's original speed:**
   Gerald's speed \( S_G \) is:
   \[
   S_G = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

5. **Calculate Gerald's improved speed:**
   With a 10% improvement in speed, Gerald's improved speed \( S_G' \) is:
   \[
   S_G' = 10 \text{ meters/second} + 0.10 \times 10 \text{ meters/second} = 10 \text{ meters/second} + 1 \text{ meter/second} = 11 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

6. **Determine Gerald's improved time:**
   Using his improved speed, Gerald's improved time \( T_G' \) is:
   \[
   T_G' = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 36.36 seconds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"Given the information provided, we can solve the problem step by step.

First, we know the number of dogs \( D \) is 60. The number of cats \( C \) is twice the number of dogs, so:
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats:
\[ R = D + C - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 \]

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we start by calculating the number of boys and girls in the Grade 5 class. Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, we can find the number of boys as follows:

\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. According to the problem, 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:

\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Thus, the number of girls who are not in the girl scout is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we start by noting that Harry slept 9 hours. James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept. Therefore, we calculate the hours James slept as follows:

\[

"To determine the number of tomatoes Freda used, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce:
     \[
     \text{Original volume of tomatoes} = 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes per can:**
   - Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.

3. **Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used:**
   - Since the original volume of tomatoes is 64 ounces and each can contains 16 ounces, the number of cans used is:
     \[
     \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

5. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Since 4 cans were used and each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
     \[
     \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. Initially, there are 30 cars on the motorway. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam, and in the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through. Additionally, 5 cars exit the motorway. The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is the sum of the cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes and the cars that drove through in the last 15 minutes.

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \). Therefore, the number of cars that drove through in the last 15 minutes is 20. After the traffic jam, 5 cars exit the motorway. The equation representing the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is:

\[ x + 20 = \text{Total cars that drove through} \]

The total number of cars that remained on the motorway after the traffic jam is:

\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = 5 - x \]

Since the remaining cars are the ones that did not drive through the traffic jam, we can set up the equation:

\[ 5 = 30 - (x + 20) \]

Simplifying the right side:

\[ 5 = 30 - x - 20 \]
\[ 5 = 10 - x \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 10 - 5 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( x = 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of potted plants Mary will remain with, we start by calculating the total number of potted plants she currently has. She has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so the initial total is:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Mary then receives 18 new potted plants from her favorite plant nursery, increasing her total to:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Next, she plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, which means she will give away:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the 40 plants she gives away from her total of 98 plants leaves her with:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings, we can break down the problem as follows:

- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a single weekend day:

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we start by determining the inner dimensions of a single box. Given that the outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches and the walls are 1 inch thick, we can calculate the inner dimensions as follows:

- The length of the inner box is \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches.
- The width of the inner box is \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches.
- The height of the inner box is \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches.

Next, we calculate the volume of one inner box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length times width times height:

\[
V_{\text{inner}} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Since there are 3 such boxes, the total inner volume \(V_{\text{total}}\) is:

First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, and this is 6 times the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Therefore, we can calculate the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as follows:
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we are told that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Let \( D \) represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Thus, we have:
\[ 300 = 50D \]

To find \( D \), we solve for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( 6 \).

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine Sasha's profit from selling her leftover lumber, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and then compare it to the total revenue from selling it.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber:
- Sasha has 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber, each costing $10. Therefore, the total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100
  \]
- Sasha also has 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber, each costing $16. Therefore, the total cost for these boards is:
  \[
  5 \text{ boards} \times \$16 \text{ per board} = \$80
  \]
- Adding these costs together gives the total cost of the lumber:
  \[
  \$100 + \$80 = \$180
  \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the lumber. Assuming the selling price is the same as the cost price, the total revenue is:
\[
\$180
\]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\$180 - \$180 = \$0
\]

Therefore, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{0}\)."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13 and the total amount used is 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water.

First, let's denote the number of teaspoons of sugar as \(7x\) and the number of cups of water as \(13x\). According to the problem, the total amount used is the sum of the teaspoons of sugar and the cups of water:

\[7x + 13x = 120\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[20x = 120\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 20:

\[x = \frac{120}{20} = 6\]

Now that we have \(x = 6\), we can find the number of teaspoons of sugar used. Since the number of teaspoons of sugar is \(7x\):

\[7x = 7 \times 6 = 42\]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:

\[
\boxed{42}
\]"

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later.

1. **Determine Adrien's initial salary:**
   Adrien's initial salary is given as $40,000.

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary of $40,000. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. Therefore, her new salary is:
   \[
   30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is:
   \[
   56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92

"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into two segments based on the given speeds and times.

First, we calculate the distance Rosie covers in the initial 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find out how much time she has left after the initial 3 hours:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Then, we calculate the distance she covers in the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding the distances from both segments gives us the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:

"To determine the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we start by noting the total number of cars available for rent is 20. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. The remaining cars are semi-automatic.

First, we calculate the number of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - (\text{Number of automatic cars} + \text{Number of manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

"Given the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( W = 2B \) (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees).
2. \( B = 2Q \) (there are twice as many baby bees as queens).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

Substituting the relationships into the total bees equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \):
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles/client} \times \$2/\text{bottle} = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = \$32 \]

Total cost for cloths for 8 clients:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack/client} \times \$5/\text{pack} = 8 \times 1 \times 5 = \$40 \]

Total expenses for all clients:
\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is given as $92.

Now, we calculate the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Thus, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of harvests John can have in a year. Since he harvests every 3 months and there are 12 months in a year, the number of harvests is:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

2. Determine the number of pineapples harvested per hectare in a year. Given that he can harvest 100 pineapples per hectare every 3 months, the number of harvests per hectare per year is:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

3. Calculate the total number of pineapples harvested from all hectares. Since John has 10 hectares, the total number of pineapples harvested in a year is:
\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Therefore, the total number of pineapples John can harvest within a year is:
\[ 4000 \]"
"To determine the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up, we need to sum the pieces from each of the three lego sets:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces.
3. The third lego set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces of the first set, which is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 \]

Thus, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees half of the 30 bees return, which is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]

4. **Bee population at the end of the first 12 hours:**
   Initially, there were no bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, and 15 bees returned, the net change is:
   \[
   0 - 30 + 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   So, at the end of the first 12 hours, there are:
   \[
   0 - 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   This means there are 15 bees that left but haven't returned yet.

5. **Bee population at the end of the day:**
   In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return to the hive. The number of bees that left in the first 12 hours is 60, and all of them return in the last 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is:
   \[
   60 \text{ bees}
   \]

Thus, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is:
\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to consider the cost of the admission tickets and the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for one adult and one child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Given that Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can deduce that Dorothy has \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) friends. James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so James has \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) friends. 

Therefore, the number of Facebook friends James has is 16. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we first need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Since there are 5280 feet in a mile, we can calculate the distances as follows:

- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel their respective distances:

- Time for Steve to bike home: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim to skateboard home: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes to reach their houses, Steve is the winner. The difference in their travel times is:

\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To calculate the total earnings from inflating tires, we need to consider the cost per tire and the number of tires for each type of vehicle.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one bicycle: \(2 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 50 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 5 bicycles: \(5 \times 50 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents}\).

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one tricycle: \(3 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 75 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 3 tricycles: \(3 \times 75 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents}\).

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one unicycle: \(1 \text{ tire} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 25 \text{ cents}\).

Summing up the total cost for all the tires:
\[
250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

Converting the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[
500 \text{ cents} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount Shawnda made that day is:
\[

"Carl buys ten packs of cookies, with each pack containing six cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[
10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for all the cookies is:

\[
60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10/\text{cookie} = \$6.00
\]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. The change he receives is:

\[
\$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{4.00}

"To determine the initial number of french fries in the pack, let's work through the problem step by step.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. After the seagull, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
5. After the pigeons, the remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
6. A raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) \) fries.
7. After the raccoon, the remaining fries are \( x - 30 - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \).
8. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
9. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6 \implies x - 30 = 18 \implies x = 48
   \]

Thus, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \( 48 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down the hours spent on different days and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Finally, we sum the hours from both types of days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"To determine the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we first need to convert all lengths to a consistent unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the lengths of the croissants and baguettes are given in inches, and the rolls are given in inches as well.

1. **Calculate the total length of the rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Total length of the rolls = \( 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \).

2. **Calculate the total length of the croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Total length of the croissants = \( 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \).

3. **Calculate the total length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is \( 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \).
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of the baguettes = \( 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \).

4. **Calculate the total length of all the baked goods:**
   - Total length = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes
   - Total length = \( 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \).

5. **Convert the total length from inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Total length in feet = \( \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \).

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is \( 280 \) feet.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly consumption for each type of ape and then sum these amounts for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monthly consumption: 200 bananas
   - For 2 months: \(200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas}\)

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Monthly consumption: 400 bananas
   - For 2 months: \(400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas}\)

3. **Baboons:**
   - Monthly consumption: 100 bananas
   - For 2 months: \(100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas}\)

Next, we sum the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over the 2 months:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how much farther Blake runs compared to Kelly, we first calculate the distance each person runs.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distance run by Blake and Kelly:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly). The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. When 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, the total number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to \(11 + 6 = 17\). However, when 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, the number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases by 2, resulting in \(17 - 2 = 15\).

Therefore, the final number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond is 15. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the water depth on Wednesday, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the depth on Tuesday:**
   - The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
   - On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday.
   - Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is \(17 + 7 = 24\) feet.

2. **Calculate the depth on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   - So, the depth on Wednesday is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16\) feet.

Thus, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we start by calculating the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the given information:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Next, we sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fish caught:

\[
15 \text{ (starfish)} + 9 \text{ (sea horses)} + 8 \text{ (clownfish)} = 32
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( P_0 = \$20 \)
   - Rate of increase: 20% every two months

2. **Calculate the price increase per two months:**
   - Increase per two months: \( 20\% \) of \( \$20 \)
   - Increase per two months: \( 0.20 \times 20 = \$4 \)

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Number of two-month periods in 36 months: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

4. **Calculate the total increase over 36 months:**
   - Total increase: \( 18 \times \$4 = \$72 \)

5. **Calculate the new price after 36 months:**
   - New price: \( P_0 + \text{Total increase} \)
   - New price: \( 20 + 72 = \$92 \)

Thus, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{92}\)."
"To find the total value of all the toys, we start by determining the cost of each type of toy based on the given information.

First, we know that one red car costs $4. Since one red car is equivalent to the cost of 3 action figures, we can find the cost of one action figure by dividing the cost of one red car by 3:
\[ \text{Cost of one action figure} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33 \]

However, the problem states that the cost of one action figure is $5. This means we should use $5 as the cost of one action figure.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the red cars:
\[ \text{Total cost of red cars} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the action figures:
\[ \text{Total cost of action figures} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Finally, the doll costs the same as 3 action figures, which is:
\[ \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to compare the missed income from freelance work to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie would lose 3 hours of freelance work if she does her taxes herself. Since she earns $35 per hour from freelance work, the missed income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

The accountant charges $90. Therefore, the difference between the missed income and the cost of hiring the accountant is:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

This means Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant. Thus, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{-15} \]"
"Elvira's total budget for the computer accessories is €1500. The cost of the accessories she has chosen includes a screen for €157, a keyboard and mouse for €74, a scanner for €102, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. Adding these costs together:

\[ \text{Total cost of accessories} = €157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509 \]

Subtracting the total cost of the accessories from her budget gives:

\[ \text{Money left for clothing} = €1500 - €509 = €991 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is €991. The correct answer is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote Brooke's current age as \( B \) and Seth's current age as \( S \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, we simplify the second equation:
\[
(S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
\]
\[
S + B + 4 = 28
\]
\[
S + B = 24
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( S = 2B \)
2. \( S + B = 24 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[
2B + B = 24
\]
\[
3B = 24
\]
\[
B = 8
\]

Now that we know Brooke's current age \( B = 8 \), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation:
\[
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to account for his walking routine on weekdays and weekends separately.

1. **Weekdays**: There are 5 weekdays in a week, and on each weekday, he walks 20 miles.
   \[
   \text{Miles walked on weekdays} = 5 \text{ days} \times 20 \text{ miles/day} = 100 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Weekends**: There are 2 days in the weekend, and on each weekend day, he walks 10 miles.
   \[
   \text{Miles walked on weekends} = 2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ miles/day} = 20 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total miles walked in a week**:
   \[
   \text{Total miles} = \text{Miles walked on weekdays} + \text{Miles walked on weekends} = 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles."
"To determine the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each component (hat, jacket, and pants) and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the hat} = \$25
   \]

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
   \]

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.
   \[
   \text{Average cost of the hat and jacket} = \frac{\$25 + \$75}{2} = \frac{\$100}{2} = \$50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the pants} = \$50
   \]

4. **Total cost of each uniform:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket} + \text{Cost of the pants}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$25 + \$75 + \$50 = \$150

2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

The total age of the four birds is the sum of the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and the Caboose. Assuming the Caboose is also 8 years old, the total age is:

\[
19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51
\]

Thus, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

The total minimum monthly payments are:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of $1000 and add it to the minimum monthly payments.

50% of $1000 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, 50% more than the minimum monthly payments is:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month} \]

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine the total time Billy will take to prep the potatoes, we first calculate the time required to peel and cut one potato. It takes Billy 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut it. Therefore, the total time for one potato is:

\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Since Billy has 60 potatoes to prepare, the total time required for all 60 potatoes is:

\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert the total time from seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:

\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:

\[ \boxed{95 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"To determine the amount Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow a step-by-step approach based on the given information.

First, we calculate the revenue generated from selling lemonade. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. Therefore, the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can set up the equation for their total revenue minus their total cost:
\[ \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$25 \]

The total revenue from selling \( x \) gallons is:
\[ \$10x \]

The total cost for \( x \) gallons includes the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is:
\[ \$3 \text{ (lemons/gallon)} + \$2 \text{ (sugar/gallon)} = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

Thus, the total cost for \( x \) gallons is:
\[ \$5x \]

Substituting the total cost into the profit equation:
\[ \$10x - \$5x = \$25 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ \$5x = \$25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{\$25}{\$5} = 5 \]

So, they sold 5 gallons of lemonade. Now, we calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:
\[ \$3 \text{ (lemons/gallon)} \times 5 \text{ gallons} = \$15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \$15 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the number of girls on the Chinese team, we start by noting the total number of participants and the breakdown of the teams. The total number of participants is 240, with 80 of them being Japanese. This leaves us with:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

Chinese participants. Given that there are 60 boys on the Chinese team, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Thus, the number of girls on the Chinese team is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the donation to charity.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

Given:
- Zaid's monthly salary: $6000
- Rent: \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary
- Car fuel: \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary
- Donation to charity: half of the remaining amount after rent and car fuel
- Amount given to daughter: $200
- Amount given to wife: $700

First, calculate the amount spent on rent:
\[
\text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500
\]

Next, calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
\[
\text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
\]

Now, determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500
\]

Calculate the donation to charity, which is half of the remaining amount:
\[
\text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250
\]

Determine the remaining amount after the donation:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250
\]

Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350
\]

Thus, the final amount of money Zaid will have left is:
\[
\boxed{350}
\]"
"To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we start by determining the number of crabs each person has based on the given information.

Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs} \]

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs} \]

Adding the number of crabs each person has gives:
\[ 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \text{ crabs} \]

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To determine Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

For the first week, Lloyd tutored for 5 hours at a rate of $10 per hour:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours at the same rate:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks gives us the total earnings:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks. The correct answer is \(\boxed{130}\)."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we start by calculating the number of votes the winner got. Given that the winner received \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes and the total number of votes cast was 80, we can calculate the votes for the winner as follows:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total votes minus the votes received by the winner:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as \( w \).

Given:
1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5w = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 5w = 200 \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now, we substitute \( w = 40 \) into the expression for the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, the number of red roses that Fred must deliver by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business is 160.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To determine Jean's current age, let's break down the information given:

1. **Jan's current age**: 30 years.
2. **Two years ago**: Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years.
3. **Mark's age two years ago**: Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\) years. Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\) years.
4. **Mark's current age**: Since Mark was 19 two years ago, his current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\) years.
5. **Jean's current age**: Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\) years.

Thus, Jean is 23 years old. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}

"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

### Team 1 (Very Well-Rounded Team)
Each member of Team 1 runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time taken by Team 1 is:
\[
55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team)
The first runner of Team 2 takes 60 seconds to run their 400 meters. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for each runner are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time taken by Team 2 is the sum of the times for each runner:
\[
60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Difference in Time
To find out how many seconds the faster team (Team 1) will win by, we subtract the total time taken by Team 1 from the total time taken by Team 2:
\[
222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team (Team 1) will win by:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To solve this problem, we need to compare the probabilities of two events: rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = P(\text{even number on first roll}) \times P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities
We need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This is given by the difference in probabilities divided by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then converted to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) - P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To find how much more likely it is, we divide this difference by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and then convert to a percentage:
\[
\text{Percentage more likely} = \left( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \right) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

### Final Answer
\[

"Given that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, we can deduce that Jenna picked 10 apples. Therefore, the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother is:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

The final numerical answer is 30."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of rats in each cage. Let's break down the information given:

1. There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
2. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
3. There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.
4. The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160.

First, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total number of pieces of straw to find the number of pieces of straw given to the rats:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

Since the rats are kept in 3 cages and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats by dividing the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats by the number of pieces each rat receives:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Since there are 3 cages of rats, we can find the number of rats in each cage by dividing the total number of rats by the number of cages:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest accrued over that period and then add it to the original amount owed.

1. **Initial amount owed**: $100
2. **Monthly interest rate**: 2% or 0.02
3. **Number of months**: 3

First, calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Next, calculate the total interest for 3 months:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, add the total interest to the initial amount owed to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict **$106**.

The correct answer is **106**."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of bags of wheat sold by the trader. Let's denote the number of bags as \( n \).

The cost of buying \( n \) bags of wheat from the farmer is \( 20n \) dollars. The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is \( 2n \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost incurred is:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \text{ dollars} \]

The trader sells each bag at $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \text{ dollars} \]

The trader's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. According to the problem, the trader made a total profit of $400. Therefore, we can write the profit equation as:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

Thus, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total expenses and then divide by the number of friends.

First, we calculate the total cost of the tickets and food:
- The cost of the tickets is $20.25.
- The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets, which is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
- Therefore, the total cost of tickets and food is $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Next, we add the cost of the rides:
- The cost of each ride is $33, and they went on 2 rides, so the total cost for the rides is $33 \times 2 = $66.00.

Now, we sum up all the expenses:
- Total cost = Cost of tickets and food + Cost of rides = $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since the three friends agreed to split the total cost evenly, we divide the total cost by 3:
- Cost per person = $102.00 / 3 = $34.00.

Thus, each friend paid $34.00.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, he collects peaches for \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes. Given that he collects 2 peaches per minute, the total number of peaches he collects is \(180 \times 2 = 360\).

Therefore, the total number of peaches John collects is 360."
"To determine the daily amount of insects needed for a flock of ten ducks, we start with the weekly requirement for one duck, which is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the daily requirement for one duck by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \text{Daily requirement for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Given that there are ten ducks in the flock, we multiply the daily requirement for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Daily requirement for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees each year**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net increase of \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Number of trees after 10 years without any deaths**: Over 10 years, the total increase in the number of trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Therefore, the total number of trees after 10 years is \(50 + 80 = 130\).
4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\).
5. **Number of trees left after the deaths**: The number of trees left after the deaths is \(130 - 39 = 91\).

Thus, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink plastic flamingos on Friday morning:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 flamingos is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) flamingos.
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **Number of flamingos left on Sue's front yard after Saturday morning:**
   - Initially, there were 18 flamingos.
   - 6 flamingos were taken back and painted white.
   - Therefore, \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) pink flamingos remained.

4. **On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos:**
   - Adding 18 more pink flamingos to the 12 remaining flamingos:
   - \( 12 + 18 = 30 \) pink flamingos.

5. **Number of white flamingos:**
   - The neighbors painted 6 pink flamingos white.
   - Therefore, there are 6 white flamingos.

6. **At noon on Sunday, the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 30
   - White flamingos: 6

7. **Difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - \( 30 - 6 = 24 \)

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

"Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser, a pen costs $1.50. To find the cost of 8 pens, we calculate:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we need to calculate his earnings from both publishers and then sum them up.

First, let's establish the rates:
- Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
- Publisher B pays Mark twice as much as Publisher A, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) cents per sentence.

Next, we calculate the total number of sentences Mark edits each week:
- Mark edits 1000 sentences per week.

Now, we calculate his earnings from each publisher:
- Earnings from Publisher A:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents per sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

- Earnings from Publisher B:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents per sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we sum the earnings from both publishers to find the total amount Mark makes in a week:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark makes in a week is \(\boxed{15000}\) cents."

   With the salary increase, John's total weekly earnings are:
   \[
   2100
   \]

4. **Total Earnings for the Year:**
   There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, his total earnings for the year are:
   \[
   2100 \times 52 = 109200
   \]

5. **Total Earnings Including the Monetary Reward:**
   Adding the one-time monetary reward to his total earnings for the year:
   \[
   109200 + 5000 = 114200

"To determine the total barrels of wine produced by Josie's farm, we start by calculating the total tons of grapes produced annually. Given that each of the 10 acres produces 5 tons of grapes per year, the total production of grapes is:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, we need to convert this total tons of grapes into barrels of wine. Since each ton of grapes yields 2 barrels of wine, the total barrels of wine produced annually is:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

Therefore, the total number of barrels of wine produced per year by Josie's farm is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"To determine the total number of cheese slices Carl used, we can break down the problem into three parts:

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich.
   - Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week.
   - He used 8 slices of cheese in the big dish.
   - Total cheese slices for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we sum up all the cheese slices used:
\[ 10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the total number of cheese slices Carl used is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine the total number of pens Janet has now, we start by calculating the number of blue and red pens she bought. Janet bought 6 bags of blue pens, with each bag containing 9 pens:

\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens/bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, she bought 2 bags of red pens, with each bag containing 6 pens:

\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens/bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, we add the number of green and yellow pens she originally had to the number of blue and red pens she bought:

\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Summing these values gives:

\[ 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Janet has now is 98. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

2. Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of tests}} \]
\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]
\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

3. Find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:
\[ \text{Score on sixth test} = 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{118} \]"
"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we can break the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the first four weeks is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the next three weeks is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

Thus, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we start by calculating the weight of each type of candy. Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each candied apple weighs half as much, we can deduce the weight of each candied apple:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Joe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams."
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Monday:**
   Rose bought 4 cakes.

2. **Tuesday:**
   On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Cakes on Tuesday} = 3 \times 4 = 12
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Cakes on Wednesday} = 5 \times 12 = 60
   \]

Now, we sum the cakes bought over the three days:
\[
\text{Total cakes} = \text{Cakes on Monday} + \text{Cakes on Tuesday} + \text{Cakes on Wednesday}
\]
\[
\text{Total cakes} = 4 + 12 + 60 = 76
\]

Thus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is:
\[
\boxed{76}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:**
   - Each plate costs $6000.
   - Half a dozen plates is 6 plates.
   - Total cost for half a dozen plates = \( 6 \times 6000 = 36000 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of each plate:**
   - The cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
   - Therefore, the cost of one plate is \( \frac{36000}{6} = 6000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost of twenty dozen cups:**
   - Let the cost of one cup be \( x \) dollars.
   - Twenty dozen cups is \( 20 \times 12 = 240 \) cups.
   - The total cost of twenty dozen cups is \( 240x \) dollars.

4. **Set up the relationship given in the problem:**
   - The total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, \( 240x = 36000 - 1200 \).

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the right-hand side: \( 36000 - 1200 = 34800 \).
   - So, \( 240x = 34800 \).
   - Solve for \( x \): \( x = \frac{34800}{240} \).

6. **Perform the division:**
   - \( x = \frac{34800}{240} = 145 \).

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is \( 145 \) dollars.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{145}\)."
"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we first calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20, with two pairs needed. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Sara already has $10 saved. The additional amount she needs to earn is:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Sara earns $4 for each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $60, we set up the following inequality:

\[ 4x \geq 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x \geq \frac{60}{4} \]
\[ x \geq 15 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn at least 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of red chickens as \( r \) and the number of white chickens as \( w \). Given that red chickens produce 3 eggs per day and white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, and that Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs per day, we can set up the following equations:

1. \( 3r + 5w = 42 \)
2. \( w = r + 2 \)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

Thus, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To verify, if \( r = 4 \), then \( w = 4 + 2 = 6 \). The total number of eggs collected per day is:

\[ 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine the time \( t \) it takes for Gary to walk this distance at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The formula for time is:

\[ t = \frac{d}{v} \]

Here, the distance \( d \) is 15 miles and his speed \( v \) is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers on the first day, which is given as 100.
2. Calculate the number of customers on the second day, which is 50 more than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers on the second day is:
   \[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
   \[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

Thus, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as \( B \) gallons.

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write the equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

We are also given that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

By equating the two expressions for \( B \):
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

Therefore, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy the shoes and the belt, we first calculate the total cost of the items. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00, so the total cost is:
\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour at her part-time job. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:
\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we first calculate the total amount she promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional 10% is calculated as follows:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 2040 \]

Now, we determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:

\[ 2200 - 2040 = 160 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we start by noting the number of roses, which is given as 4. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Therefore, the number of dahlias can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their average age in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Harriet's age in 3 years} = 21 + 3 = 24
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Zack's age in 3 years} = 42 + 3 = 45
     \]
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Adrian's age in 3 years} = 63 + 3 = 66
     \]

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   The average age is the sum of their ages in three years divided by 3:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in 3 years} + \text{Zack's age in 3 years} + \text{Adrian's age in 3 years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3}

"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we start by calculating the points scored by Yuri and Brianna based on the information given.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Therefore, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Next, we sum the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

Given that the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's score by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:

"To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type after the changes, we start with the updated counts of each type of card. Initially, James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards. After losing 8 water type cards and buying 14 more grass type cards, the counts become:

- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
- Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

The total number of cards is now:
\[ 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 \]

The percentage of water type cards is calculated as:
\[ \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{3} \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounding 33.33% to the nearest integer gives us 33%.

"Initially, the watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons. After two months, 30% of these watermelons were ready for harvest. To find out how many watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

This means 36 watermelons were ready for harvest, and Ashlyn took them home. Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after she took the ready ones is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. We calculate the number of watermelons that were ready:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This indicates that 63 watermelons were ready for harvest. Consequently, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Thus, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."

\[
\text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
\]

Add the tax to the total cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration:
\[
\text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
\]

Now, calculate the total registration cost for all 12 cars:
\[
\text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000
\]

Finally, add the total registration cost to the total cost before registration to find the final amount Mark pays:
\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
\]

Therefore, the final amount Mark pays is:
\[
\boxed{276000}

"Given that there are 50 ants in the garden and the number of bugs is half the number of ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75. 

The correct answer is 75."
"To determine how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of penguins**: We start with 36 penguins.

2. **Penguins that jump in the ocean**:
   - One-third of the penguins jump in the ocean.
   - Calculate one-third of 36:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
     \]
   - So, 12 penguins jump in the ocean.

3. **Penguins that go into the cave**:
   - Another one-third of the penguins go into the cave.
   - Calculate one-third of 36:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
     \]
   - So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

4. **Total number of penguins that leave the snow**:
   - Add the penguins that jump in the ocean and those that go into the cave:
     \[
     12 + 12 = 24
     \]

5. **Penguins still sunbathing**:
   - Subtract the total number of penguins that leave the snow from the initial total:
     \[
     36 - 24 = 12
     \]

Thus, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine the number of vines Steve needs, we first calculate the weekly consumption of tomatoes by both Steve and his girlfriend. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half of that, which is 3 tomatoes per day. Therefore, their combined daily consumption is:

\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} + 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} = 9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \]

Next, we calculate their weekly consumption by multiplying their daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Given that each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, the number of vines needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week is:

\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

Thus, Steve needs 21 vines. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

The correct answer is: **10**"
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we need to consider the process of mixing the ink from empty pens to make new pens.

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   Ram buys 25 pens.

2. **Mixing Process:**
   Ram can mix the ink from five empty pens to make one new pen. This means that for every 5 empty pens, he can create 1 new pen.

3. **Calculating the Number of New Pens:**
   - Initially, Ram has 25 pens.
   - To find out how many sets of 5 pens he can use to make new pens, we divide the total number of pens by 5:
     \[
     \frac{25}{5} = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, Ram can make 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens.

"To solve the problem, we start with the initial number of students in the hall, which is 1000.

1. **Students exiting through exit A**: 30% of 1000 students.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students exited through exit A.

2. **Remaining students after exit A**: 
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. **Students exiting through exit B**: \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 700 students.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students exited through exit B.

4. **Students exiting through exit C**: The rest of the students.
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has.

1. **Determine Robert's Candies:**
   - We know that John has twice as many candies as Robert.
   - John has 54 candies.
   - Therefore, Robert has:
     \[
     \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

2. **Determine James's Candies:**
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert.
   - Robert has 27 candies.
   - Therefore, James has:
     \[
     \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33
     \]

3. **Find the Difference Between John's and James's Candies:**

"Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals. After stopping being pen pals with 2 of them, he is left with 3 pen pals. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 3 pen pals in kind, so he also sends 30 pages a week. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we first convert the total number of pages into minutes:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we convert the total minutes into hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we first calculate the total minutes he has used. Jason makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day, and there are 30 days in the month. Therefore, the total minutes used for these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used an extra 300 minutes for calls to other people. Adding these together gives the total minutes used:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the plan's allowance:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin.

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin as \(x\). After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. According to the problem, in the end Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

From the problem, we know:
- The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is 28.
- This difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ 32 - 4 = 2 \times (2F) \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

Solving for \( F \):
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 7 \).

The correct answer is:

"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies each of them ate over the two days.

Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday. Therefore, the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate is:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, which means:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, which means:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]
So, the total number of cookies Sue ate is:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. Therefore, the total calories consumed by Sue is:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]
And the total calories consumed by her sister is:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten, we start by calculating the total weight of the entire tree before any damage. Given that each 10-foot section of the tree weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tree:

\[
\text{Number of sections} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the tree:

\[
\text{Total weight} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since the termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, 70% of the tree remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30) = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}

"Given the information provided, we can deduce the number of fruits step by step.

First, we know Andrea has 52 apples. According to the problem, Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. Therefore, Jamal has:
\[ J_a = A_a - 8 = 52 - 8 = 44 \text{ apples} \]

Next, Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so the number of bananas Jamal has is:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48 \text{ bananas} \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which we can verify:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 168. The correct answer is:

"To determine the total cups of flour Carla will need, we can follow these steps:

First, calculate the total number of cookies Carla is making:
- Today, Carla is making 36 cookies.
- Tomorrow, Carla is making 30 cookies.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(36 + 30 = 66\).

Next, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up the following proportion:
\[
\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}

"To determine how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we start by calculating the number of trees each person has.

First, we know that Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has:
\[
\text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has:
\[
\text{Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has} = 2 \times 3 = 6
\]
\[
\text{Number of trees Harry has} = 6 + 5 = 11
\]

To find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
\[
\text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

Therefore, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined, we start by calculating the individual amounts each girl has.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ \text{Samantha's money} = 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ \text{Daisy's money} = 125 + 50 = 175 \]

To find the total amount of money all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts together:
\[ \text{Total money} = 100 + 125 + 175 \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 100 + 125 = 225 \]
\[ 225 + 175 = 400 \]

Thus, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"To determine how much more the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total price including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Brokerage Fee**: 5% of the selling price
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

2. **Transfer Fee**: 12% of the selling price
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

3. **Total Price Including Fees**: Selling price + Brokerage Fee + Transfer Fee
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

4. **Exceeding the Budget**: Total Price - Mrs. Cruz's Budget
\[ \text{Exceeding the Budget} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

Therefore, the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget by $9,500.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for all the expenses and the loan repayment. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   The total expenses include the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale:**
   The net proceeds from the sale of the house is the selling price minus the total expenses.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds from sale} = 400,000 - 32,000 = 368,000
   \]

5. **Subtract the loan repayment:**
   Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = 368,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
   \]

Thus, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is:
\[
\boxed{118000}

"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we need to break down the process into its components and sum them up.

First, the oil takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees.

Next, it takes 40% longer to heat the oil to 400 degrees. To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]
So, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

After heating the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. Therefore, the cooking time is:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding up all the times:
\[ 20 \text{ (heating to 300 degrees)} + 28 \text{ (heating to 400 degrees)} + 23 \text{ (cooking)} = 71 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[ \boxed{71} \]"
"To determine the total amount spent by the real estate agent on the ads, we need to calculate the cost for both the newspaper ads and the television ads separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- Cost per newspaper ad = $5
- Number of newspaper ads = 50

Total cost for newspaper ads = Cost per newspaper ad * Number of newspaper ads
Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50
Total cost for newspaper ads = $250

Next, let's calculate the cost for the television ads:
- Cost per television ad = $75
- Number of television ads = 15

Total cost for television ads = Cost per television ad * Number of television ads
Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15
Total cost for television ads = $1125

Now, we sum the total costs for both types of ads:
Total amount spent = Total cost for newspaper ads + Total cost for television ads
Total amount spent = $250 + $1125
Total amount spent = $1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on buying all the ads."

"To determine the total number of windows in John's two houses, we need to consider both the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
     \[
     6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}
     \]

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives:
     \[
     12 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 8 \text{ windows (additional)} = 20 \text{ windows}
     \]

Thus, the total number of windows between the two houses is:

"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we start by analyzing the given information:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
- The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Next, we calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
\[ 90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 270 \text{ stitches} \]

Subtracting the stitches used for the collar and the rosette from the total stitches gives us the number of stitches used for the sleeves:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \text{ stitches} \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2 to find the number of stitches per sleeve:
\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches per sleeve} \]

Thus, each sleeve takes \(\boxed{765}\) stitches."
"To determine the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.

\[
\text{Total cost of tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the celery seeds:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.

\[
\text{Total cost of celery seeds} = 80 \times 30 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the total cost of the tomato seeds and the total cost of the celery seeds to find the total amount of money used:

\[

\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is \(\boxed{3200}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
     \[
     2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
     \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
     \[
     54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
     \]

4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize:**

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the time required for each type of hole separately and then sum these times.

First, let's calculate the time to dig the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

\[
\text{Time for small holes} = 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time to dig the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

\[
\text{Time for large holes} = 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time for both types of holes:

\[
\text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}

"Given that the sum of Mico's and Marco's current ages is 20, we can denote Mico's current age as \( M \) and Marco's current age as \( R \). Therefore, we have:

\[ M + R = 20 \]

In 10 years, Mico's age will be \( M + 10 \) and Marco's age will be \( R + 10 \). The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 20 \]

Since we know that \( M + R = 20 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote Sam's current age as \( S \) and Ruby's current age as \( R \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for \( S \):

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of spots a mamba has. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots a mamba has, we can calculate the number of spots a mamba has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of spots a mamba has} = \frac{70}{2} = 35
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[
\text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800
\]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[
\text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100
\]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[
\text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900
\]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

"To determine the time the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles, we start by noting the speed of the car in the slow lane, which is half the speed of the car in the fast lane. The car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour, so the car in the slow lane travels at:

\[
\text{Speed of the car in the slow lane} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

Given that the car in the fast lane traveled a total distance of 480 miles, we can calculate the time it took for the fast lane car to travel this distance using the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the car in the fast lane:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same 480 miles:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults.

\[
4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

Subtracting the number of chocolate bars the adults will receive from the total number of chocolate bars gives us the number of chocolate bars left for the children.

\[
40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them.

\[
\frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child}
\]

Thus, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how much money Susan earns, we first calculate the total time she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. Converting this into minutes:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Susan takes a 30-minute break, so the actual time she spends working is:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she earns per minute. Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, her earnings per minute are:

\[ \frac{5 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \text{ dollars/minute} \]

Now, we calculate the total earnings for the 150 minutes she works:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/minute} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns for the online task is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Let's break down the problem again to ensure clarity and accuracy.

1. **Points after the first three rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Determine if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round:**
   - Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

3. **Calculate the total points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike's total points: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
   - Jim's total points: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
   - Tony's total points: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

4. **Sum the total points of all three players:**
   \[
   21 + 18 + 43 = 82
   \]

The final total number of points that all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{82}\)."
"Will initially buys 15 oranges. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means the youngest son is 4 years old. Together, they wash a total of 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. Therefore, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find the total count of activities Darren did over the two days, we can break down the problem as follows:

**First Day:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Second Day:**
- Pushups: 100 + 20 = 120
- Squats: 50 - 10 = 40
- Dumbbell presses: 20 * 2 = 40

Now, let's calculate the total number of each activity over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
- First day: 100
- Second day: 120
- Total: 100 + 120 = 220

**Total Squats:**
- First day: 50
- Second day: 40
- Total: 50 + 40 = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
- First day: 20
- Second day: 40
- Total: 20 + 40 = 60

Finally, we sum up the totals for all activities:

**Total count of activities:**
- Pushups: 220
- Squats: 90
- Dumbbell presses: 60
- Total: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

Therefore, the total count of the activities he's done in the two days is 370."
"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total daily consumption and then extend that to a weekly consumption. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 members in the household, eating at both lunch and dinner. Therefore, the daily consumption is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:

\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Finally, to find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total bag weight by the weekly consumption:

\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first need to calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week. The week in question includes Monday and Friday, which are days he was closed, so no crates were sold on those days. The remaining days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

The crates sold each day are as follows:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

First, we sum the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 \]

Next, we add the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine the total amount Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to sum up all her bids. Carmen's bids form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 200\) and the common difference \(d = 50\). The number of terms \(n\) in the sequence is 100 (since she bids 100 times).

The formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

For the 100th term:
\[ a_{100} = 200 + (100-1) \cdot 50 = 200 + 99 \cdot 50 = 200 + 4950 = 5150 \]

The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ S_{100} = \frac{100}{2} (200 + 5150) = 50 \cdot 5350 = 267500 \]

Therefore, the total amount Carmen paid for the antique desk is $267,500.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{267500} \]"
"To determine the total cost John pays for driving in a year, we need to consider both the cost of the miles driven and the monthly bonus given to the driver.

1. **Calculate the total distance driven in a year:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Distance for a round trip: \(30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles}\)
   - Number of round trips per week: 5 days
   - Number of weeks per year: 50 weeks
   - Total distance driven in a year: \(60 \text{ miles/round trip} \times 50 \text{ round trips/year} = 3000 \text{ miles/year}\)

2. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total cost for miles driven: \(3000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 6000 \text{ dollars/year}\)

3. **Calculate the total bonus given to the driver per year:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Number of months per year: 12 months
   - Total bonus per year: \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year}\)

4. **Calculate the total cost for the year:**
   - Total cost for miles driven: $6000
   - Total bonus per year: $1800
   - Total cost for the year: \(6000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 7800 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is \(\boxed{7800}\)."
"To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first calculate the total time he exercised on Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. Therefore, the total time exercised on Monday and Sunday is:

\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount of time on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:

\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed for a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and the printing layout. When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers, each capable of printing two pages: one on the front and one on the back. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print 4 pages.

Given that a 32-page tabloid has 32 pages, we can calculate the number of pieces of paper required as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
\]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper needed to create a 32-page tabloid is 8.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine how much money Annika has left after her expenses, we start with the initial amount she brought to the town fair, which is $50. She first spends half of this amount on food and snacks:

\[
\text{Amount spent on food and snacks} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

After spending on food and snacks, she has:

\[
50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, she spends an additional $10 on rides. Subtracting this from the remaining amount:

\[
25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money left with Annika is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of books sold in the second year:**
   - We know that Elise sold 45 books this year.
   - According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did this year. Therefore, in the first year, she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books.
   - The total number of books sold over the three years is \(90 + 45 + 200 = 335\), but since she only had 250 books, this means she sold all the books over the three years.

2. **Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year:**
   - Each book is sold for $20.
   - The number of books sold in the second year is 45.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is \(45 \times 20 = 900\).

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{900}\)."
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well, we need to add this bonus to his weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings with bonus} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \]

Since Watson earns weekly, we consider only full weeks in April. Therefore, we consider 4 full weeks in April.

\[ \text{Total earnings for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 800 \, \text{\$/week} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Since the company performed very well for the whole month, Watson also receives the $300 bonus for each of the 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total bonus for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 1200 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we add his total earnings from his hourly wage and the total bonus to find his total earnings for April.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 3200 \, \text{\$} + 1200 \, \text{\$} = 4400 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:

\[ \boxed{4400} \]"
"John arm wrestled 20 people. If he beats 80% of them, we can calculate the number of people he beat and subsequently the number he lost to.

First, we find 80% of 20:
\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we start by calculating the number of loaves sold in the morning. The bakery produces 60 loaves each day, and two-thirds of these are sold in the morning.

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

After the morning sales, the number of loaves remaining is:

\[
\text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we start by calculating Joey's weekly weight loss. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weekly weight loss is:

\[ \text{Weekly weight loss by Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we calculate the total weight Sandy needs to lose as:

\[ \text{Weight Sandy needs to lose} = 2 \text{ pounds/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 8 \text{ pounds} \]

Given that Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds is:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total savings, we need to calculate the difference in cost for both the ice cream and the milk when bought at the original prices versus the discounted prices.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the discount is the same for each packet, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5
- Savings on one packet of milk: $0.5

Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to consider the growth rates of the extra arms and extra legs.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - We need to find out how many times 3 days fit into 15 days.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \)
   - Therefore, the person will grow 5 extra arms in 15 days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - We need to find out how many times 5 days fit into 15 days.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \)
   - Therefore, the person will grow 3 extra legs in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs.
   - Calculation: \( 5 + 3 = 8 \)

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

2. Calculate the total cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

3. Determine the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

4. Sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

5. Theo has a total of $6000 for the trip and wants to save $2000 for the trip. Therefore, the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

6. Subtract the cost of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the total amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of people and their daily egg consumption:**
   - There are 5 people in the family.
   - 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.
   - The remaining 2 people eat 2 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 3 people:**
   - Each of the 3 people eats 3 eggs per day.
   - Total eggs consumed by these 3 people per day = \(3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs/day}\).

3. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for the 2 people:**
   - Each of the 2 people eats 2 eggs per day.
   - Total eggs consumed by these 2 people per day = \(2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs/day}\).

4. **Calculate the total daily egg consumption for the entire family:**
   - Total eggs consumed per day = Eggs consumed by the 3 people + Eggs consumed by the 2 people
   - Total eggs consumed per day = \(9 \text{ eggs/day} + 4 \text{ eggs/day} = 13 \text{ eggs/day}\).

5. **Calculate the total weekly egg consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total eggs consumed in a week = Total eggs consumed per day \(\times\) Number of days in a week
   - Total eggs consumed in a week = \(13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}\).

Therefore, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"Given the relationships in the problem, we can determine Trent's age step by step.

1. We know that Quinn is 30 years old.
2. Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age as:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]
3. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we can find Trent's age as:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Relate the population of Chile six years ago to Noah's age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).

5. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - So, \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

6. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Since the population of Chile six years ago was 120000, the current population is \(120000 \times 2 = 240000\).

Therefore, the population of Chile now is \(\boxed{240000}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of players on the defense as \( D \).

Given:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To isolate \( D \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine the number of people who showed up for Martha's party, we start by calculating the total number of people initially invited. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. Therefore, the total number of people invited is:

\[2 \times 6 + 3 \times 4 = 12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness. This number is 8 people. Additionally, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. The number of people with previous commitments is:

\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:

\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Subtracting the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited gives us the number of people who showed up for the party:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

Thus, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine the total weight of the marbles Solomon has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has:**
   - Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
   - His father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times the number of marbles he bought from Johanna. Therefore, the number of marbles his father gave him is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
     \]
   - Adding the marbles bought from Johanna and the marbles given by his father, the total number of marbles is:
     \[
     20 + 8 = 28
     \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the marbles:**
   - Each marble weighs 2 kg.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the 28 marbles is:
     \[
     28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ kg}
     \]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is \(\boxed{56}\) kg."
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of children in the classroom based on the given information.

1. **Number of Boys**: The problem states there are 30 boys in the classroom.

2. **Number of Girls**: Since there are 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Number of Nongendered Children**: The problem indicates that there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. Therefore, the number of nongendered children is:
   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Total Number of Children**: To find the total number of children, we sum the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can determine the number of electric poles required.

From the ratio, we know that for every 3 electric wires, there is 1 electric pole. Therefore, if there are 45 electric wires, we can find the number of electric poles by dividing the number of wires by 3:

\[ \text{Number of electric poles} = \frac{\text{Number of electric wires}}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of people:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total people initially: \(25 + 15 = 40\)

2. **After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left:**
   - Number of people who left: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)
   - Number of people remaining: \(40 - 10 = 30\)

3. **Given that 22 men stayed at the party:**
   - Number of men who left: \(25 - 22 = 3\)
   - Number of women who left: \(10 - 3 = 7\) (since 10 people left in total and 3 were men, the rest must be women)

4. **Number of women remaining:**
   - Initial number of women: 15
   - Number of women who left: 7
   - Number of women remaining: \(15 - 7 = 8\)

Therefore, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"Given that the book costs $4, the magazine, which costs half as much as the book, would cost:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the cost of the pen is:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1. 

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we first need to find out how many pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. This can be expressed as:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils Jam has is:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Meg has 46 pencils. Adding the pencils of Jam and Meg together gives:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Since each box can hold 8 pencils, the number of boxes needed to store 72 pencils is:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Thus, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{9}\)"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of cooling and the addition of cream separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters, but it does add 15 milliliters to the total volume of the drink. However, the question asks how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, not how much stronger the drink is. Therefore, the addition of cream does not affect the milliliters weaker calculation.

Thus, the total reduction in milliliters due to the cooling and the addition of cream is simply the reduction due to the cooling:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people, we need to consider the trade ratio and the final outcome. Given that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record, and 5 people leave with 7 new records, we can deduce the following:

Since 2 old records are traded for 1 new record, to get 7 new records, we need:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

This means that to obtain 7 new records, a total of 14 old records are required. Since this trade is done by 5 people, and the total number of old records needed is 14, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 14.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of junior and senior programmers. Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

The number of senior programmers is then:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know the monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000. Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is:

\[ \text{Salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Now, we calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:

\[ \text{Total salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Similarly, we calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Adding these two amounts gives the total monthly salary for all programmers:

\[ \text{Total monthly salary} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. Initially, let \( x \) represent the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the total number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second bus stop is:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

According to the problem, after the second bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many lollipops Oscar has at the end.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first need to calculate the percentage of charging required. The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which means it needs to charge an additional 40%.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

\[
\text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[
120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time required to fully charge the phone is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine the final amount the customer paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase. Therefore, the rewards earned are:
   \[
   \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip:**
   The customer used their rewards on this shopping trip. Since they earned 4 rewards, they used 4 rewards. Each reward is worth $1 off the next purchase.

Thus, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we need to calculate the net income for both Job A and Job B.

For Job A:
- Annual income before tax: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
- State tax: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
- Net income for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- State tax: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
- Net income for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Comparing the net incomes:
- Job A net income: $24,000
- Job B net income: $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
- $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, which is Job B, compared to Job A. The final answer is $8,400."

"To determine the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we need to calculate the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge separately and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers.

\[
\text{Sugar for suckers} = 8 \text{ batches} \times 30 \text{ ounces per batch} = 240 \text{ ounces}
\]

Next, we calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason needs to make 1 batch of fudge.

\[
\text{Sugar for fudge} = 1 \text{ batch} \times 70 \text{ ounces per batch} = 70 \text{ ounces}

"To solve this problem, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group would be \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can write the equation as follows:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we add 10 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 70 \]

So, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, the total number of animals is 60, and there are twice as many chickens as cows. This gives us the following equations:

\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):

\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we find the number of chickens:

\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:

\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is 160."

"To determine how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we first need to calculate her monthly expenses and then extend that to a yearly total.

1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   - Madeline spends $25 per week on food.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost per Month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of treats is $20.

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of medicine is $100.

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs of food, treats, and medicine:
   \[
   100 \text{ (food)} + 20 \text{ (treats)} + 100 \text{ (medicine)} = 220 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the annual cost is:
   \[
   220 \text{ dollars per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 2640 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

Thus, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year."
"To determine the total duration of Peyton's after-work activities, we will calculate the duration of each activity and then sum them up.

1. **Monday's yoga class**: 1 hour.
2. **Tuesday's cooking class**: 3 times the duration of Monday's yoga class, which is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
3. **Wednesday's cheese-tasting event**: 0.5 hours.
4. **Thursday's museum tour**: Half the duration of Tuesday's cooking class, which is \(3 / 2 = 1.5\) hours.
5. **Friday's errands**: 2 hours.

Now, we sum up the durations:
\[ 1 \text{ (Monday)} + 3 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours for all Peyton’s after-work activities is \(\boxed{7.5}\)."
"April had already bought 100 plant pots. She needs 30 for the daisies and twice that amount, which is 60, for the roses. Therefore, the total number of plant pots needed is 30 + 60 = 90. Given that she already bought 100 plant pots, the number of plant pots she has left over is 100 - 90 = 10. 

Thus, the number of plant pots April has left over is 10. 

The correct answer is 10."
"To determine how much Andrea saved, we start with the initial amount of money she had, which is $36. After spending $11 on a sweater and giving $4 to her brother, the total amount spent is $11 + $4 = $15. Therefore, the amount she saved can be calculated by subtracting the total amount spent from her initial amount:

\[ S = 36 - 15 \]
\[ S = 21 \]

Thus, Andrea saved $21. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"John spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which totals:
\[ 6 + \frac{6}{2} = 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, which totals:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows gives:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Let \( T \) be the total time spent. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we first calculate her total earnings from both jobs. From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours, which totals:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours, which totals:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding her initial savings to her total earnings from both jobs gives:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, let's break down the information given:

1. The shortest tree has a height of 6 feet.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:
   \[
   6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
   \[
   6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"To determine how much money Dean has left, we start by calculating the total cost of the toys he purchased. Dean bought 6 toy cars at $2 each and 5 teddy bears at $1 each.

The cost of the toy cars is:
\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

The cost of the teddy bears is:
\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total amount spent on toys:
\[ \$12 + \$5 = \$17 \]

Dean initially had $28 from his mother. After spending $17 on toys, the remaining amount is:
\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Then, his mother gives him an additional $10:
\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ \$21 \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Morgan's budget for the party is $90. She plans to spend $5 on mini-golf, $5 on arcade tokens, and $20 on two rides on the go-karts. The total cost for these activities is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. After accounting for these expenses, the remaining budget is $90 - $30 = $60. Since each go-kart ride costs $10, the number of friends she can invite, assuming each friend gets to ride the go-karts once, is $60 / $10 = 6. Therefore, the number of friends she can invite is 6.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how much money Marisa saves in her piggy bank over 5 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the daily expenditure on lollipops:
\[ 4 \text{ lollipops/day} \times 25 \text{ cents/lollipop} = 100 \text{ cents/day} \]
Since 100 cents is equivalent to 1 dollar, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Next, calculate the daily savings by subtracting the daily expenditure on lollipops from her daily pocket money:
\[ 5 \text{ dollars/day} - 1 \text{ dollar/day} = 4 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Finally, to find out how much she saves over 5 days, multiply her daily savings by 5:
\[ 4 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought given the constraints. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Total Money and Cost of Candy:**
   Billy starts with $10 and spends it on candy at a rate of $1.5 per pound. If he buys \( x \) pounds of candy, the total cost is \( 1.5x \) dollars.

2. **Change Calculation:**
   The change Billy has after buying the candy is \( 10 - 1.5x \) dollars.

3. **Spending on Gumballs:**
   Billy spends half of his change on gumballs. He buys 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, so the cost of the gumballs is \( 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \) dollars. This amount is half of his change, so the change is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) dollars.

4. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   Since the change is $4, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   10 - 1.5x = 4
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   10 - 4 = 1.5x
   \]
   \[
   6 = 1.5x
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4
   \]

Therefore, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Let's denote Carver's son's age as \( x \) years. According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. This relationship can be expressed by the equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the total distance of one complete round trip. The distances are as follows:

- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trips, which is \(100 + 75 = 175\) miles, so \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles

The total distance for one complete round trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days}\]

To convert this into hours, we recognize that \(\frac{1}{20}\) of a day is equivalent to 12 hours (since \(\frac{1}{20} \times 24 = 1.2\) hours).

Therefore, the train goes between services every 12 hours. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we start by calculating the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. The collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. Given that a Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds, the average amount of stuffing for a collie bed is:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for 3 collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds gives us the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is \(\boxed{23}\) pounds."
"To find the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each segment of the journey and then sum them up.

First, the time to drive to his friend's house is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, the time for the detour, which adds 10 miles to the original 200 miles, is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{21}{7} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Then, the time to drive back home, covering 240 miles at 80 mph, is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{24}{8} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these times together gives the total trip time:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time for the trip is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we start by calculating the number of boys in total. Given that there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls were absent, so the number of girls present is:

\[ 43 - 5 = 38 \]

Since the total number of fourth-graders is 96, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 96 - 38 = 58 - 4 = 54 \]

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

\[ 54 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"Given that there are 6 girls in the park and the number of boys is twice the number of girls, we can calculate the number of boys as \(2 \times 6 = 12\). Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is the sum of the girls and the boys, which is \(6 + 12 = 18\).

Thus, the total number of kids in the park is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) be the score she needs on her third test. The equation representing the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons.

First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks. Let's denote the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as \( S \). According to the problem, this number is four times the number of customers for refusing to wear masks minus 5. Therefore, we can write:
\[ S = 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

Next, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of customers for shoplifting. Thus, we have:
\[ \text{Number of customers kicked out for physical violence} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of customers kicked out is 50. The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]
Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that Sara scored 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we calculate the points Erin has after scoring 14 points:
   \[
   \text{Points Erin has after scoring 14 points} = 3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
3. Since Erin scored 14 points after already having some points, we can find out how many points Erin had before by subtracting the 14 points she scored from the 24 points she has now:
   \[
   \text{Points Erin had before} = 24 - 14 = 10
   \]

Thus, the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points is 10. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into different components and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10

"To determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment:**
   - Given that 40% of the total number of pieces are faulty, we can express the number of faulty pieces as \(0.4N\), where \(N\) is the total number of pieces of equipment.

2. **Calculate the number of functioning pieces of equipment:**
   - The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces.
   - Number of functioning pieces = \(N - 0.4N = 0.6N\).

3. **Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces:**
   - The total cost of the equipment is $400,000.
   - The cost of the functioning pieces is \(0.6\) times the total cost.

"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Total number of sheep**: Mary has 30 sheep.
2. **Half of the sheep providing milk**: Half of the 30 sheep will provide milk. This means:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ sheep}
   \]
3. **Milk from half of the sheep**: Each of these 15 sheep provides 1 kg of milk per day. Therefore, the total milk from these 15 sheep is:
   \[
   15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg}
   \]
4. **Other half of the sheep providing milk**: The other half of the 30 sheep will also provide milk. This means:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ sheep}
   \]
5. **Milk from the other half of the sheep**: Each of these 15 sheep provides 2 kg of milk per day. Therefore, the total milk from these 15 sheep is:

"To determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she received $56 from selling them at $4 per apple. Therefore, the number of apples sold on Monday is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}

- Number of Months (n) = 5

First, we calculate the total amount to be paid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5884.4115 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5884.4115}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.8823 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.88 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is \(\boxed{1176.88}\)."
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 67 \]"
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we start by calculating the number of each type of peso Anna has based on Axel's holdings.

Axel has 50 silver pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Axel has 80 gold pesos. Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Next, we sum the silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Then, we sum the gold pesos they have together:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos together to find the total number of pesos:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we first need to calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade she can make. Since she can make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups, the total number of cups she can make is:

\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

Given that she sells each cup for $1, the total revenue from selling all 36 cups is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes for her to sell all 36 cups. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, the time required to sell all 36 cups is:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

The cost to make the lemonade is $18. To find the profit per hour, we need to determine the profit over the 9-hour period and then divide by 9:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

The profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2/\text{hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine the total amount of land Mr. Ruther initially had, we start with the information that he sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land and was left with 12.8 hectares. This means that the remaining \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares.

We can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate \(x\). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{5}\), which is \(\frac{5}{2}\):
\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:
\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

To make the multiplication easier, we can convert 12.8 to a fraction:
\[
12.8 = \frac{128}{10} = \frac{64}{5}
\]

Now, multiply:
\[
x = \frac{64}{5} \times 2.5 = \frac{64}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{64 \times 5}{5 \times 2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32
\]

Thus, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we start by calculating the number of girls in the choir. Given that the choir has 52 members and 50% are girls, we can find the number of girls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
\]

Since the choir decides to perform only with its female members, the number of female members is 26. On the day of the performance, half of these female members can't make it because their bus breaks down, so only half of them can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

Additionally, the choir's 3 teachers decide to join them. Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is the sum of the female members who can perform and the 3 teachers:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"To determine Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his five test scores: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74. The average is calculated by summing these scores and then dividing by the number of scores.

First, we sum the scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Adding these step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

The total sum of the scores is 400. To find the average, we divide this sum by the number of scores, which is 5:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we can break down the calculation into two parts: the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils.

First, we calculate the cost of the erasers:
\[ 6 \text{ erasers} \times \$2 \text{ per eraser} = \$12 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pencils:
\[ 8 \text{ pencils} \times \$3 \text{ per pencil} = \$24 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives us the total cost:
\[ \$12 + \$24 = \$36 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is \$36."
"To determine the total number of messages James delivers, we start by noting that he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. The number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu is one-third of the number delivered to Ms. Thompson. Therefore, we calculate the number of messages to Mr. Yu as follows:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Adding the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu gives us the total number of messages:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
\]

Thus, the total number of messages James delivers is:

\[
\boxed{88}
\]"
"To determine how much money David saves, we need to compare the costs of the two options: buying a ride bracelet for David and buying tickets for Dasha.

First, let's calculate the cost for David if he buys a ride bracelet. The ride bracelet costs $30 and it provides 9 rides. Therefore, David's total cost is $30.

Next, let's calculate the cost for Dasha if she buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. Therefore, the cost per ride is $2 * 2 = $4. For 9 rides, the total cost is $4 * 9 = $36.

Now, we find the difference in cost between Dasha's and David's total costs. The difference is $36 - $30 = $6.

Thus, David saves $6 by buying the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap.
2. Divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

First, let's find the total number of gifts:
- Monica has 6 gifts to wrap for her family.
- She has 4 gifts to wrap for her friends.
- She has 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers.

Adding these together:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

So, Monica has a total of 12 gifts to wrap.

Next, we need to divide the total length of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Given the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can determine the number of popsicles each has by setting up the equations based on the ratio and the total.

Let \( B \) represent the number of popsicles Betty has, and \( S \) represent the number of popsicles Sam has. The ratio \( B:S = 5:6 \) can be expressed as:
\[ B = 5k \]
\[ S = 6k \]
for some constant \( k \).

The total number of popsicles is given by:
\[ B + S = 165 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( k \):
\[ 5k + 6k = 165 \]
\[ 11k = 165 \]
\[ k = \frac{165}{11} \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each has:
\[ B = 5k = 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
\[ S = 6k = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty:
\[ S - B = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus normally:**
   - Each costs $10 per month.
   - Total normally: \(10 + 10 = 20\) dollars per month.

3. **Savings on Hulu and Disney Plus:**
   - He saves 20% on bundling.

"To determine the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we first need to convert all the time spent into minutes for consistency.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours
  \[
  4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent recording the song: half of the time spent writing it
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes

Next, we sum up the total time spent on all activities:
\[
240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing. The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{450 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

Then calculate the percentage:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\%

"To determine the total number of Valentine's cards Erica has, we start by calculating the initial number of cards she has. Erica made 20 cards and her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, each containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards her dad brought is \(2 \times 15 = 30\). Adding these together, the total number of cards Erica has initially is:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, we account for the cards that were passed out and received:
- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find the net change in the number of cards Erica has, we subtract the cards passed out and add the cards received:
\[ 50 - 24 + 17 = 43 \]

Therefore, the total number of Valentine's cards Erica now has is:
\[ \boxed{43} \]"
"To determine how many slices of pizza are left, we start by calculating the number of slices given to Bill and Mark. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices given to Bill and Mark together, we get:

\[ 4 \text{ slices} + 3 \text{ slices} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices given away and eaten is:

\[ 7 \text{ slices} + 2 \text{ slices} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Subtracting the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices, we find the number of slices left:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial number of cannolis:**
   Allan starts with 40 cannolis.

2. **Number of cannolis after buying more:**
   Allan buys 60 more cannolis, so the total number of cannolis becomes:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]

3. **Initial number of corns:**
   The problem states that there are twice as many corns as cannolis initially. Since there are 40 cannolis:
   \[
   \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

4. **Number of corns after buying fewer:**
   Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying more. Since he had 100 cannolis after buying more:
   \[
   \text{Number of corns after buying fewer} = 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]

5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis:**
   Now, we add the number of corns and cannolis Allan has:
   \[
   60 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 160
   \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
\boxed{160}

4. **Remaining Steps**: After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
   \[
   10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:

"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we need to calculate the total time required for him to finish reading the book and then account for the time it takes to get to the airport.

First, we calculate the total number of words in the book:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Next, we find out how long it takes Toby to read the entire book. Given that he reads at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time required to read 9000 words is:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, he needs to finish reading the book 50 minutes before he needs to leave the airport. Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

early.

Thus, the number of minutes early Toby will be is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we can break down the problem into several steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in May:**
   - Number of employees in May: 40
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in May: 4 (since May has 31 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in May:
     \[
     40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in May:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in May:
     \[
     6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June:**
   - Number of employees whose contracts expired: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)

4. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by employees in June:**
   - Number of employees remaining in June: \(40 - 10 = 30\)
   - Hours worked per employee per week: 40
   - Weeks in June: 4 (since June has 30 days)
   - Total hours worked by employees in June:
     \[
     30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in June:**
   - Hourly wage per employee: $15
   - Total amount paid in June:
     \[
     4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees in both May and June:**
   - Total amount paid in May: $96000
   - Total amount paid in June: $72000
   - Total amount paid in both months:
     \[
     96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{168000}\)."
"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and then subtract this from the $10 she was given.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. This means for every 2 pounds of taffy, Sally pays $3 for the first pound and only $1.50 for the second pound. Since Sally bought 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, the cost of the seashells is straightforward. Each seashell costs $1.50, and Sally bought 4 seashells:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \]

The cost of the magnets is also straightforward. Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 \text{ (taffy)} + 6.00 \text{ (seashells)} + 1.00 \text{ (magnets)} = 11.50 \]

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost from the $10:
\[ 10.00 - 11.50 = -1.50 \]

Since the result is negative, it means Sally does not have enough money to cover the total cost. Therefore, she is short by $1.50.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-1.50}
\]"
"To determine the total amount Tim spent, we start by calculating the cost of the fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, which is $800. Therefore, the total cost of the two packs of fireworks is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, Tim receives a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost of the fireworks gives:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding the cost of the finale firework to the discounted cost of the fireworks results in the total amount spent:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies each night. Over a period of 30 days, she will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 12 cookies per dozen, to determine how many dozens of cookies she needs to make 60 cookies, we perform the following calculation:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days. 

The correct answer is 5 dozens."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We know the following:

- 95% of the candles are safe and do not explode.
- 5% of the candles are dangerous and have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
- 1% of the dangerous candles explode (since 5% of the candles are dangerous and 1% of those are guaranteed to explode).

First, we calculate the number of dangerous candles:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Next, we determine how many of these dangerous candles will explode:
\[ \text{Number of dangerous candles that explode} = 1\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.01 \times 2500 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the discounted blouses, we start by calculating the sale price of each blouse after the 30% discount. The regular price of each blouse is $20. The discount amount per blouse is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

Subtracting this discount from the regular price gives the sale price per blouse:

\[ \text{Sale price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees. Let's break down the information given:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, which means she gathers \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples from the tallest trees.
- Her sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, so she gathers \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples from the shortest trees.
- Her sister does not gather any apples from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. We can set up the equation to find out how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees:

\[ \text{Apples from tallest trees (Joanne)} + \text{Apples from shortest trees (Joanne)} + \text{Apples from average trees (Joanne)} + \text{Apples from tallest trees (sister)} + \text{Apples from shortest trees (sister)} = 500 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):

\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given information:
- There are 180 heads in total.
- There are 304 humps in total.
- Camels have 2 humps each.
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each.

Let \( c \) represent the number of camels and \( d \) represent the number of dromedaries. We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

1. \( c + d = 180 \) (total number of heads)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (total number of humps)

To eliminate \( d \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now, substituting \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the journey into segments and sum the distances.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:

\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

\[
\boxed{3140}
\]"
"Given the problem, we need to determine the volume of Timothy's locker. Let's denote the volume of Timothy's locker as \( T \) cubic inches.

From the problem, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so the volume of Zack's locker is \( \frac{T}{2} \).

Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, so the volume of Peter's locker is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{T}{2} = \frac{T}{8} \]

We are given that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{8} = 5 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 8:
\[ T = 5 \times 8 \]
\[ T = 40 \]

Thus, the volume of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 40 \]"

Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet. The difference in elevation is calculated as follows:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7000 \]"
"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from both banks, we start by calculating the amount he received from the second bank. Since the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which was $4000, the amount from the second bank is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Next, we add the amounts received from both banks to his initial capital. Mr. Josue initially had $5000 in capital. Therefore, the total capital he has now is:

\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Thus, the final amount of capital Mr. Josue has now is:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats each carried away 5 cats, so the total number of cats taken away is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats remaining on the rock is:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran away is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting the number of cats that ran away from the remaining cats gives:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ 12 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods and sum them up.

1. **First 6 months:**
   - The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for 6 months = \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \) dollars.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8):**
   - The cost is $12 per month.
   - Total cost for 2 months = \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Next 10 months (months 9 to 18):**
   - The cost is $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 10 months = \( 10 \times 14 = 140 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
48 + 24 + 140 = 212
\]

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\boxed{212}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the costs of the jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28, and the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, which means the jogger jeans cost $22.

Next, we need to determine how much Cole saved in total, which is $6. According to the problem, Cole saved \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. This means he saved \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) dollars from the jogger jeans and \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) dollars from the tattered jeans.

The difference in cost between the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans is calculated as follows:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we need to calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle and then sum these capacities.

1. **Buses:**
   - Number of buses: 4
   - Capacity per bus: 60 employees
   - Total capacity for buses: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) employees

2. **Minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses: 6
   - Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
   - Total capacity for minibusses: \( 6 \times 30 = 180 \) employees

3. **Minivans:**
   - Number of minivans: 10
   - Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
   - Total capacity for minivans: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \) employees

Now, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 \text{ (buses)} + 180 \text{ (minibusses)} + 150 \text{ (minivans)} = 570 \text{ employees} \]

Thus, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the number of bird feeders and the number of birds each type of feeder attracts.

First, Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more from the store, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds per day. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds/feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Each of the bird feeders Lillian made herself attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts:
\[ 20 \text{ birds/feeder} + 10 \text{ birds/feeder} = 30 \text{ birds/feeder} \]

Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders Lillian made herself is:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds/feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Adding the birds attracted by both types of feeders, the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day is:
\[ 60 \text{ birds} + 90 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{150}

"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the price of the bagel.
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. **Cake**: The cake is half the price of the bagel.
   \[
   \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2

\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11
\]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) for the dinner she ordered."
"To determine the total number of cards Kenny started with, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards at $1.5 each, and he ends up with $50 after purchasing a ticket that costs $100. This means he has $50 left after buying the ticket, which is the total amount he earned from selling the cards.

The total money he earns from selling the cards is:
\[ \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) \times 1.5 = x \]

Given that he has $50 left after buying the ticket, we can set up the equation:
\[ x = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[ x = 50 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of guests who would have eaten two hotdogs if everyone had only eaten one:**
   - There are 36 guests, and half of them would have eaten two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).
   - So, 18 guests would have eaten two hotdogs each.

2. **Calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared:**
   - 18 guests would have eaten 2 hotdogs each, so \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - This means the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs.

3. **Determine the number of guests who actually wanted a second hotdog:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog.
   - Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, 4 hotdogs were left unprepared.

4. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - Out of the 40 guests, 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of letters in Indras' name, which is 6. Next, we need to determine the number of letters in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half the number of letters in Indras' name. 

First, we calculate half the number of letters in Indras' name:
\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Then, we add 4 to this value to find the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Now, we sum the number of letters in both names to find the total:
\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{13}\)."
"To determine the total cost of Charlotte's order after a 20% discount, we first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The items include a set of pot and pans for $120.00, a set of mixing bowls for $20.00, and 5 utensils at $5.00 each. The cost of the utensils is calculated as follows:

\[ 5 \times 5.00 = 25.00 \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost before the discount:

\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount to the total cost. A 20% discount means Charlotte pays 80% of the total cost. We calculate 80% of $165.00:

\[ 0.80 \times 165.00 = 132.00 \]

Thus, the final amount Charlotte has to pay is:

\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Next, we sum the money Dora currently has:
- Money from allowance: $2
- Money from mother: $16

Total money Dora has:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs an additional $1 to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of dragons each prince slew, we can follow these steps:

1. Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur slew three quarters of the number of dragons that Prince Thaddeus slew. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
3. Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Walter slew is:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
4. Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine how much gas Josey needed, we start by calculating the amount of gas in each container. Given that 15 gallons of gas are divided equally into 5 containers, each container contains:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, which translates to:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, the amount of gas needed in pints is:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"

1. **Total Money Spent and Left:**
   George spent $5 and had 1% left, which means he spent $4.95 on items.

2. **Cost of Chips:**
   Each bag of chips costs $0.40. If George bought 3 bags of chips, the total cost for chips is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Money Left After Buying Chips:**
   Subtract the cost of chips from the total amount spent:
   \[
   4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Candy Bars:**
   Each candy bar costs $0.75. The remaining $3.75 is spent on candy bars:
   \[
   \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \text{ candy bars}

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to arrive at the theater first, we start by noting the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time it takes Wayne to drive to the theater from the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater:

\[
\text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} - \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 16 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = 12 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start with the given area and length. The area of the room is 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards. First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula for a rectangle to find the width:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ 98 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 98 \]"
"To determine how many more beads one sister has compared to the other, we first calculate the total number of beads each sister bought.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads. Therefore, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Next, we find the difference in the number of beads between Margareth and Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the final temperature of the house, we need to follow the sequence of events and their respective impacts on the temperature.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.
2. **Temperature Increase from Oven**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
   - Total temperature increase from the oven = 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.
3. **Temperature Decrease from Window**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Time the window is open = 30 minutes.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.
   - Total temperature decrease from the window = 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.
   - Final temperature after the window is closed = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

Thus, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"To determine the time it took James to complete the run, we start by calculating the time James took for each segment of the triathlon based on the given information.

First, we convert Jon's times into minutes:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 60 + 20 = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes

The total time Jon took is:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes} \]

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Therefore, the time James takes for the swim is:
\[ 40 \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Therefore, the time James takes for the bike is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Let \( R \) be the time James takes for the run. The total time James took is:
\[ 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \text{ minutes} \]

We know that Jon won the race by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Setting the total time James took equal to 180 minutes, we get:
\[ 121 + R = 180 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"Given that Movie C was 1.25 hours long, we first convert this duration into minutes. Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, Movie C is \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes long.

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is \(75 + 5 = 80\) minutes.

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, the length of Movie A is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) minutes.

Thus, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes. The correct answer is 20."
"To determine the change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   - The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour for 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours).
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 32 miles/hour × 0.5 hours = 16 miles.

2. **Calculate the amount of hay consumed:**
   - For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
   - Total hay consumed = 16 miles × 1/2 bail/mile = 8 bails.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3.
   - Total cost = 8 bails × $3/bail = $24.

4. **Calculate the change Michael has:**
   - Michael has 6 five-dollar bills, which totals to $30.
   - Change = $30 - $24 = $6.

Therefore, the change Michael has after buying the hay is $6. The correct answer is:

"To determine how many trays Rozanne can put out, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs she has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs amount to:

\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is:

\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

Therefore, the number of trays Rozanne can put out is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine by how many points Joey is now winning, we start by calculating his new score after scoring 26 points:

\[
\text{Joey's new score} = 214 + 26 = 240
\]

Next, we calculate Marcy's new score after she scores 10 points:

\[
\text{Marcy's new score} = 225 + 10 = 235
\]

To find out by how many points Joey is now winning, we subtract Marcy's new score from Joey's new score:

\[
\text{Difference} = 240 - 235 = 5
\]

Therefore, Joey is now winning by 5 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}

"To determine the profit, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the cost price per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[
\text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each on Monday:

\[
\text{Revenue from Monday sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, we determine the number of sneakers sold to the department store, which is the total number of sneakers minus the number sold at the flash sale:

\[
48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
\]

The department store sold these 31 sneakers at $25 each, so the revenue from the department store is:

\[
\text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find the total revenue by adding the revenue from both sales:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue. The total cost is the cost price of all 48 sneakers, which is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[
\text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{539}

Next, we calculate the number of crayons in the four packets that each contain 16 pieces:
\[ 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces per packet} = 64 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we add the two quantities together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the total number of crayon pieces Beatrice bought is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, which includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. Therefore, the total cost for the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and soda separately:
\[ 21 = 15 + P - 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 21 = 13 + P \]
\[ P = 21 - 13 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

Thus, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original cost per balloon:**
   - The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   - Therefore, the cost per balloon was:
     \[
     \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the new cost per balloon after the price increase:**
   - The cost per balloon increased by $20.
   - Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
     \[
     \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - The cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - First, break down the multiplication:
     \[
     170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
     \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     \[
     170 \times 60 = 10200
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 5 = 850
     \]
   - Add the results:
     \[
     10200 + 850 = 11050

"To determine the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:

1. For the first segment:
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \( 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \)

2. For the second segment:
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \( 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \)

Next, we add the distances to find the total distance:
\[ 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we calculate the total time taken:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

Therefore, the car's average speed during the trip is \( 50 \, \text{mph} \)."
"Initially, Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 of these sapphires for 2 rubies. Each sapphire is worth $800, so the value of the 3 sapphires she traded is:

\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, the rubies she receives are worth the same amount, which is $2400. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the value of the 2 rubies is:

\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

After the trade, Jenna has 5 sapphires left. The value of these 5 sapphires is:

\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

The total value of all her jewels (sapphires and rubies) is the sum of the value of the sapphires and the value of the rubies:

"To determine the cost of the potting soil for Bob's raised beds, we first need to calculate the volume of one raised bed and then the total volume for all 10 beds. Each raised bed measures 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

For one raised bed:
- Length = 8 feet
- Width = 2 feet
- Height = 2 feet

So, the volume of one raised bed is:

\[ V = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of potting soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. To find the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15.
   \[
   \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24
   \]
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we start by converting the shark's length from feet to inches. Since the shark is 10 feet long and 1 foot equals 12 inches, the shark's length in inches is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. The correct answer is:

- Paul drives in the morning twice a day.
- Each morning ride costs $6.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of morning rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ morning rides} \]

The total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 6 \text{ dollars/ride} = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the afternoon rides:
- Paul drives in the afternoon twice a day.
- Each afternoon ride costs $2.
- He drives for 14 days.

The total number of afternoon rides in 14 days is:
\[ 2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ afternoon rides} \]

The total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 28 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ride} = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we sum the total costs for the morning and afternoon rides to find the total amount spent:
\[ 168 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{224} \]"
"To determine the total number of Greek orange pies that Brianne and Ashley can make, we first calculate the total number of oranges they brought. Ashley brought five boxes with ten oranges in each box, so the total number of oranges Ashley brought is:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges/box} = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so the number of oranges Brianne brought is:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Adding the oranges brought by both Ashley and Brianne gives the total number of oranges:

\[ 50 \text{ oranges} + 70 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Since each Greek orange pie requires three oranges, the total number of pies they can make is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges/pie}} = 40 \text{ pies} \]

Therefore, the number of Greek orange pies they can make is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we start by setting up the equation based on the given costs.

For the first venue, the total cost is the flat fee of $200 plus $5 per guest for food, which can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5n \]

For the second venue, the total cost is $25 per guest, which can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Cost}_2 = 25n \]

We need to find the number of guests \( n \) for which the costs are equal:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

To solve for \( n \), we first isolate \( n \) on one side of the equation:
\[ 200 = 25n - 5n \]
\[ 200 = 20n \]

Next, we divide both sides by 20:
\[ n = \frac{200}{20} \]
\[ n = 10 \]

Therefore, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is \( 10 \).

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Let's denote the number of insects found by David as \( D \). According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so the number of insects found by Lily is \( D + 7 \). Additionally, David found half of what Bodhi found, so the number of insects found by Bodhi is \( 2D \).

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ \text{Insects found by Lily} = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

So, the number of insects Lily found is 16.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To determine the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma, we start by calculating the individual amounts of yarn used.

Mariah used \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a skein of yarn, and since there are 364 yards in a skein, the amount of yarn Mariah used is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
\]

Her grandma used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a skein of yarn, so the amount of yarn her grandma used is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of yarn used:
\[
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
\]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards. The correct answer is \(\boxed{273}\)."
"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie buys, we need to account for the gifts she purchases for her friends and the additional gifts she buys as a surprise.

\[2 \times 5 = 10\]

Next, we calculate the number of gifts for her 3 friends who each want 2 gifts:
\[3 \times 2 = 6\]

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Cherrie then decides to buy 10 more random gifts as a surprise. Therefore, the total number of gifts she buys is:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Thus, the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"To determine the length of the couch, we need to follow the given information step by step.

1. **Width of the chair**: Given as 3 feet.
2. **Width of the rug**: The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Therefore, the width of the rug is:
   \[
   3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. **Length of the couch**: The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. First, we calculate twice the width of the rug:
   \[
   2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. **Length of the couch**: Adding 2 feet to the result:
   \[
   16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"To determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we start with the total cost equation given in the problem. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum, one pack of grape gum for $2, and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1. The total cost is $7.

The equation representing the total cost is:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Where \( S \) is the cost of each pack of strawberry gum. Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

Thus, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make, we need to consider the cost and yield of the wood pieces.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Each 2 x 4 piece yields 200 sticks. Therefore, the total number of sticks from 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood is:

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces Frederick can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Each 2 x 8 piece yields 400 sticks. Therefore, the total number of sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood is:

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 8 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Since 1600 sticks from 2 x 8 pieces is greater than 1200 sticks from 2 x 4 pieces, the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make is:

\[
\boxed{1600}
\]"

"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass. Janet takes 2 bus trips each day and does this for 5 days a week, resulting in a total of \(2 \times 5 = 10\) bus trips per week. Each bus trip costs $2.20, so the total cost for the bus trips is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much Janet would save by buying the pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the bus trips: \(22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Farm's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The farm has 30 cows.
   - Let the number of sheep on the farm be \( S \).

2. **Zoo's Cows and Sheep:**
   - The zoo has 20 sheep.
   - Let the number of cows on the zoo be \( C \).

3. **Relationships Given:**
   - The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm: \( C = 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo: \( S = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

4. **Total Animals:**
   - Total animals on the farm: \( 30 \text{ (cows)} + 10 \text{ (sheep)} = 40 \).
   - Total animals on the zoo: \( 60 \text{ (cows)} + 20 \text{ (sheep)} = 80 \).

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. The problem states that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

Given:
- Rose bought 12 onions.
- Rose bought 4 potatoes.

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as \( S_o \) and the number of potatoes Sophia bought as \( S_p \).

From the problem, we know:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, we calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:
\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, we set up the equation based on the relationship:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

To find \( S_o + S_p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Thus, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pounds Andy needs to lose:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.

2. **Determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn:**
   Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of days Andy has until his goal:**
   Andy's goal is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the days from December 31st to July 19th.

   - **December:** 31 - 31 = 0 days (since December 31st is the last day of December)
   - **January:** 31 days
   - **February:** 28 days (2023 is not a leap year)
   - **March:** 31 days
   - **April:** 30 days
   - **May:** 31 days
   - **June:** 30 days
   - **July:** 19 days (up to July 19th)

"To solve the problem, let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we have:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the equation \( H = 3L \):

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000. The correct answer is:

\text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

Thus, the number of cookies Kelsie made is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"To determine the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we will follow a step-by-step approach.

First, calculate the total amount of money Ali has:
- Ali has four $10 bills, which totals \(4 \times 10 = 40\) dollars.
- Ali also has six $20 bills, which totals \(6 \times 20 = 120\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total amount of money Ali has is \(40 + 120 = 160\) dollars.

Next, Ali gives half of his total money to his sister:
- Half of 160 dollars is \(\frac{160}{2} = 80\) dollars.
- After giving half to his sister, the remaining money is \(160 - 80 = 80\) dollars.

Then, Ali uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining money to buy dinner:
- \(\frac{3}{5}\) of 80 dollars is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{240}{5} = 48\) dollars.
- After spending 48 dollars on dinner, the remaining money is \(80 - 48 = 32\) dollars.

Thus, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is \(\boxed{32}\)."

"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we will calculate the individual rates and then sum them up.

1. **Tony** can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. **Bobby** picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy** can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky** picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we sum the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which the people can paint and then use that rate to find out how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house.

1. **Determine the painting rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, in one day, one person can paint \(\frac{1}{2} \div 5 = \frac{1}{10}\) of a house.

2. **Determine the combined painting rate of 5 people:**
   - If one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day, then 5 people can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}\) of a house in one day.

3. **Determine the time required for 5 people to paint a whole house:**
   - Since 5 people can paint \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a house in one day, they will need \(2\) days to paint a whole house.

4. **Convert the time from days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, 2 days is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

So, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"Given the information provided, we can deduce the number of sofas and chairs each person has and then calculate the total.

First, we know that Ophelia has 20 sofas. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can determine the number of chairs she has:
\[ S_O = 20 \]
\[ C_O = S_O + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22 \]

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia:
\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66 \]

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can find the number of sofas she has:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together is 172. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had not bought the headphone set, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of the headphone set:**
   - Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set.
   - The CD cost $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
     \[
     48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how many CDs Tom could buy with the money spent on the headphone set:**
   - Each CD costs $4.
   - With $44, the number of CDs Tom could buy is:
     \[
     \frac{44}{4} = 11 \text{ CDs}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many more CDs Tom could have bought without the headphone set:**
   - Without the headphone set, Tom would have $48.
   - The number of CDs he could buy with $48 is:
     \[
     \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ CDs}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
     \[
     12 - 11 = 1 \text{ CD}
     \]

Thus, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy \(\boxed{1}\) more CD."

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 passengers get off the bus.
- The number of passengers who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 passengers get off the bus.
- The number of passengers who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) passengers.

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

Therefore, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
   - Therefore, his current age is \( 27 - 5 = 22 \) years.

2. **Determine his cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, his cousin's age in 8 years will be \( 60 - 5 = 55 \) years.

3. **Determine his cousin's current age:**
   - If his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then his cousin's current age is \( 55 - 8 = 47 \) years.

4. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.

"Given the information provided, we can set up the equations based on the problem statement. We know the total cost of the computer, two monitors, and a printer is $2,400. The cost of the computer is $1,100, and the printer costs $400 less than the computer, which means the printer costs $700. Let's denote the cost of one monitor as \( M \).

The equation for the total cost is:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]

Combining like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]

Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $300. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"

   - The number of boys and girls is equal.
   - Therefore, the number of boys and girls is:
     \[
     \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys:**
   - Each boy brought 60 seashells.
   - The total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
     \[
     10 \times 60 = 600
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of seashells brought by the girls:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - The number of seashells brought by the boys is 60.
   - Four times the number of seashells brought by the boys is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine Elvis's daily savings in the second half of April, given that he saves twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half and his monthly target is $1125.

Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Consequently, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

April has 30 days, so the first half consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings in the first half of April would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings in the second half of April would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings would be the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

Given that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125, we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $25 each day in the first half of April. Consequently, in the second half of April, he needs to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine the change Verna received, we first calculate the total cost of the fruits she purchased. 

The cost of the apples is calculated as follows:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, the cost of the oranges is calculated as:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, the cost of the peaches is calculated as:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the change Verna received is $7.00. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. According to the problem, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can write the equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

"To determine the total cost for lunch today at Subway, we start by noting the cost of the foot-long fish sub, which is $40. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub. Therefore, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is:

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Adding the cost of both subs together gives:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

Thus, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of buttons with two holes and the number of buttons with four holes:**
   - There are 7 buttons with two holes.
   - The total number of buttons is 21, so the number of buttons with four holes is:
     \[
     21 - 7 = 14
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes:**
   - Each of the 7 buttons has 2 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
     \[
     7 \times 2 = 14
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with four holes:**
   - Each of the 14 buttons has 4 holes, so the total number of holes from these buttons is:
     \[
     14 \times 4 = 56
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons:**
   - Add the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes and the buttons with four holes:
     \[
     14 + 56 = 70
     \]

Therefore, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine the volume of Peter's locker, we start by calculating the volume of Zack's locker. Given that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, and Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches, we can calculate the volume of Zack's locker as follows:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of Peter's locker, which is one-fourth the size of Zack's locker. Therefore:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Thus, the volume of Peter's locker is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

Given that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, he should reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

To find the exact reduction, we need to know the value of \( R \). However, since the problem does not provide the value of \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \).

The reduction in Juan's coffee intake is:
\[ 5R - 4 \]

If we assume the daily recommended cups of coffee \( R \) is a known value, we can substitute it into the expression to find the exact reduction. For example, if \( R = 8 \) (a common daily recommended amount of coffee), then:
\[ 5R - 4 = 5 \times 8 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To determine the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to sum the number of hamsters and guinea pigs. 

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages, each containing 10 hamsters.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages, each containing 5 guinea pigs.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Adding the number of hamsters and guinea pigs together gives us the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

Thus, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents. 

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we start by determining their individual weights. Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so her weight is:

\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so his weight is:

\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the three friends:

\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:

\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{180} \]"
"To determine the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider the initial angle of the sun from the ground and the angle it has moved upward.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun from the Ground:**
   - The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.
   - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is directly above the entrance.

2. **Sun's Movement:**
   - The sun moves at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.
   - Over 10 hours, the sun will move \( 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \) upward.

3. **Final Angle Calculation:**
   - Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground.
   - After 10 hours, the sun will be 50 degrees above the tip of the pyramid.
   - Therefore, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be the sum of the initial angle and the angle the sun has moved upward:
     \[
     32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
     \]

Thus, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{82}\)."
"To determine how much James spends on candles, we first need to find the total number of candles required. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the second son is 8 years old. Therefore, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

Each pack contains 5 candles, so the number of packs required is 20 / 5 = 4 packs. Given that each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 * $3 = $12.

Thus, the amount James spends on candles is $12. The correct answer is:

"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we can break down the problem as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate the total reading time in the first week
Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 days in the first week. Therefore, the total reading time in the first week is:
\[
15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the reading time in the first week to pages
We know that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[
\frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute}
\]

Now, we convert the 105 minutes of reading time in the first week to pages:
\[
105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 3: Add the reading time in the second week
In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

### Step 4: Calculate the total reading time in two weeks
\[
140 \text{ pages (first week)} + 100 \text{ pages (second week)} = 240 \text{ pages}
\]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To determine how many sandwiches are left, we start with the total number of sandwiches, which is 12. 

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, so we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Adding the sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor gives:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Subtracting the total number of sandwiches eaten from the initial total gives the number of sandwiches left:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is 5."
"To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

Shiloh's current age is 44 years.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \]

In 7 years, his nephew's age will be:
\[ x + 7 \]

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the current age of Shiloh's nephew is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we need to sum up the contributions from each set of teeth lost.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Total for these three teeth: \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth.
   - Amount per tooth for the last two teeth: \(\frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50\) dollars.
   - Total for the last two teeth: \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the amounts:

\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9.00}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of goals each teenager scored based on the given information.

1. We know that Richie scored 80 goals.
2. The problem states that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. Therefore, we can calculate Anna's goals as follows:
   \[
   \text{Anna's goals} = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]
3. Additionally, the problem indicates that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark. Thus, we can determine Mark's goals by subtracting 20 from Richie's goals:
   \[
   \text{Mark's goals} = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]

Now, to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we sum their individual goals:
\[
\text{Total goals} = \text{Richie's goals} + \text{Mark's goals} + \text{Anna's goals} = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{175}\)."

"To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven when the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to account for the 4% error in the oven's temperature readings.

Given that the oven is off by 4% when set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees, we can use this information to find the correct temperature setting for 520 degrees.

First, let's express the relationship between the set temperature and the actual temperature. If the set temperature is \( x \) degrees, the actual temperature will be \( 0.96x \) degrees (since 4% off means 96% of the set temperature).

We need the actual temperature to be 520 degrees:
\[ 0.96x = 520 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{520}{0.96} \]
\[ x = 541.67 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to approximately 541.67 degrees to achieve the desired 520 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{541.67} \]"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we first convert the durations into minutes for easier addition.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Since 1 hour equals 60 minutes, the first movie is:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes, we get:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the durations of the two movies together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes} = 215 \text{ minutes} \]

"To find the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses, we start by determining the value of Juan's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we first calculate 30% of Herb's house value, which is $76,000.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Subtracting this amount from Herb's house value gives us the value of Juan's house:

\[ \text{Value of Juan's house} = 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, we add the value of Juan's house to the value of Herb's house to find the combined value:

\[ \text{Combined value} = 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is \(\boxed{129200}\)."
"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

"To determine the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the total calories burned during her workout. She burns 500 calories per hour during aerobics and 600 calories per hour during running. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics and 1 hour running.

1. **Calories burned during aerobics:**
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Calories burned during running:**
   \[
   1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Total calories burned:**
   \[
   1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how much water Hannah needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned. Therefore, the total amount of water she needs to drink is calculated as follows:
\[
\frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 800 ml. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"Given the problem, we start by defining the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left-hand side:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of green jelly beans that are more than the number of red jelly beans is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find the average of the three measurements of Jared's typing speed, we start by noting the three speeds:

1. Initial speed: 47 WPM
2. Speed after first increase: 52 WPM
3. Speed after second increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Next, we sum these three speeds:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

To find the average, we divide the sum by 3:

\[
\frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

Thus, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{52}\)."
"To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight changes for each option over the specified period.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is:
  \[
  1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is:
  \[
  1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
\[
8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is \(\boxed{2.5}\) pounds."
"To determine the total number of seats Alex needs, we need to account for all the attendees based on the invitations and responses.

1. **Initial Invitations:**
   - Alex invites 100 people.
   - Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends.
   - Therefore, the number of friends invited is \(100 \times 2 = 200\).

2. **Additional Invitations:**
   - Alex calls 10 of her friends.
   - 8 of these 10 friends say they will be bringing their spouses.
   - Therefore, the number of spouses bringing additional guests is 8.

3. **Total Attendees Calculation:**
   - Alex herself is attending.
   - The 100 people she initially invited.
   - The 200 friends invited by the initial 100 people.
   - The 10 friends Alex called.
   - The 8 spouses bringing additional guests.

Adding these together:
\[ 1 \text{ (Alex)} + 100 \text{ (initial invitees)} + 200 \text{ (friends invited by initial invitees)} + 10 \text{ (friends Alex called)} + 8 \text{ (spouses)} = 319 \]

Therefore, Alex will need \(\boxed{319}\) seats."
"To determine the weight of the Mastiff, let's follow the given information step by step:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Dachshund} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Papillon} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Mastiff} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, the weight of the Mastiff is \(\boxed{220}\) pounds."
"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost for each platform and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Amazon:
- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is:
  \[
  16 + 4 = 20
  \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost for eBay:
- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon. Since the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is:
  \[
  2 \times 4 = 8
  \]
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is:
  \[
  13 + 8 = 21
  \]

Now, we find the difference in total costs between eBay and Amazon:
\[
21 - 20 = 1
\]

Thus, the boots are \(\boxed{1}\) dollar more expensive on eBay."
"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we start with the initial height of the beanstalk and observe its growth pattern. The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles its height every day. Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk each day:

- Day 0 (initial height): 4 feet
- Day 1: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet
- Day 2: \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet
- Day 3: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet

On Day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet height of Mark's window.

To confirm, let's check the height on Day 2:
- Day 2 height: 16 feet, which is less than 20 feet.

Therefore, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on Day 3.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - Given that 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms contains 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
     \[
     200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total protein intake per week:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total protein intake per week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week}
     \]

The final numerical answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

The problem states that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be expressed as:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Expanding and simplifying the equation:
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:
\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

\[ 13 \]"
"To determine how many hours George needs to work to pay for his dental work, we first calculate the total cost of the procedure. George requires 2 dental implants, each costing $2000, and one of these implants includes an additional $500 for a porcelain crown. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 2 \times 2000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

George has already paid a $600 deposit, so the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars} \]

Given that George earns $15 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work to earn the remaining $3900 is:

\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{260} \]"
"Given that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, and we have one angle that is twice the smallest angle, another angle that is three times the smallest angle, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

And the angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine how many gumballs Colby can buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he has in cents. 

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents/nickel = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent/penny = 15 cents

Adding these amounts together gives:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Since each gumball costs 5 cents, the number of gumballs Colby can buy is:
345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

Therefore, the final answer is 69 gumballs."
"To determine the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to consider the number of legs each type of pet has and then multiply by the number of each type of pet.

- Dogs have 4 legs each.
- Cats have 4 legs each.
- Birds have 2 legs each.

Given:
- There are 5 dogs.
- There are 2 cats.
- There are 10 birds.

Now, we calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

1. **Dogs:**
   \[
   5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Cats:**
   \[
   2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs per cat} = 8 \text{ legs}
   \]

3. **Birds:**
   \[
   10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs per bird} = 20 \text{ legs}
   \]

Next, we sum the legs from all the pets:
\[
20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}
\]

Thus, the total number of legs in the pet store is:

"To solve the problem, we first determine Ruiz's hourly production rate. Given that Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, we calculate the hourly rate as follows:

\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Next, we find Marissa's hourly production rate. According to the problem, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly rate as:

\[
\text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

Similarly, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[
\text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding the total amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa gives us the combined total:

\[
\text{Total chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[
\boxed{1260}

"To determine how much money Howard has left after his spending at the arcade, we need to calculate his total spending over the three days and then subtract that from his initial amount of $100.

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   Howard spends $8 on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's spending} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday's spending} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Spending:**
   To find the total amount spent over the three days, we sum the amounts spent each day.
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Money:**
   Howard originally had $100. To find out how much he has left after his spending, we subtract the total spending from his initial amount.
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}

"To determine Patrick's total earnings from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate his earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate his earnings for the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

Earnings for the first 4 hours:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 15 \times 4 \times 0.50 = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30.00 \]

Next, let's calculate his earnings for the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

Earnings for the next 2 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 10 \times 2 \times 0.60 = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12.00 \]

Now, we sum the earnings from both segments of time:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

"To determine how many years Jeremy's tires will last before needing replacement, we start by calculating the total number of rotations the tires undergo in a month. Given that the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles driven, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we first find the rotations per mile:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations for 400 miles:

\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

Now, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations the tires can undergo by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Total months} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert 72 months into years:

\[ \text{Total years} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the cost of each pump in cents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of washes per pump:**
   - The directions state that 2 pumps give 120 washes.
   - Therefore, the number of washes per pump is:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of washes Jackie gets per bottle:**
   - Jackie uses 1 pump per wash.
   - Therefore, the total number of washes per bottle is:
     \[
     2 \text{ pumps} \times 60 \text{ washes per pump} = 120 \text{ washes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost per wash:**
   - The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
   - The total number of washes per bottle is 120.
   - Therefore, the cost per wash is:
     \[
     \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
     \]

4. **Convert the cost per wash to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, the cost per wash in cents is:
     \[
     0.20 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 20 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Determine the cost per pump:**
   - Since each pump gives 60 washes and each wash costs 20 cents, the cost per pump is:
     \[
     60 \text{ washes per pump} \times 20 \text{ cents per wash} = 1200 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, the cost of each pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"To determine how much money Joe will have left after purchasing the outfit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the shirt.
2. Calculate the discounted price of the shorts.
3. Sum the discounted prices to find the total cost of the outfit.
4. Subtract the total cost of the outfit from Joe's initial amount of $50.

First, let's calculate the discounted price of the shirt. The original price of the shirt is $25, and there is a 30% discount:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
So, the discount amount for the shirt is $7.50. Therefore, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, let's calculate the discounted price of the shorts. The original price of the shorts is $35, and there is a 30% discount:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
So, the discount amount for the shorts is $10.50. Therefore, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, we sum the discounted prices to find the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the outfit from Joe's initial amount of $50:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the amount of butter Juan needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of butter required for one dozen croissants:**

   \text{Butter per dozen} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make per day:**
   \[
   \text{Dozens per day} = 4
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week:**
   \[
   \text{Days in a week} = 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total dozens per week} = 4 \text{ dozens/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozens}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozens of croissants:**
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 28 \text{ dozens} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total butter needed} = 28 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Therefore, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first calculate the cost for each street individually.

For Monica's street:
- Length: 150 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 29100 \, \text{dollars}
\]

For Lewis' street:
- Length: 490 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 94860 \, \text{dollars}
\]

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = 94860 \, \text{dollars} - 29100 \, \text{dollars} = 65760 \, \text{dollars}

"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 50 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes \(10 \times 5 = 50\) months in total.
   - The first 5 months of the extended period are already covered by the initial funding.
   - Therefore, the extended period is \(50 - 5 = 45\) months.

3. **Funding for Extended Period:**
   - Each month after the first 5 months costs 50% more than the initial $20,000 per month.
   - The cost per month for the extended period is \(20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000\) dollars.
   - The total funding for the extended 45 months is \(45 \times 30,000 = 1,350,000\) dollars.

4. **Total Funding:**
   - Adding the initial funding and the extended funding gives us the total cost.
   - Total cost = Initial funding + Extended funding
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1450000}\)."
"To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team, we need to sum the meat consumption of each player individually.

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate beef tips, each an ounce in size, and there were 8 beef tips. Therefore, the second player ate \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces of meat.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.
4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, we sum the meat consumption of the first three players:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

Thus, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

First, we calculate the number of cars towed during the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for three days, so the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cars towed during the remaining four days. Since the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the number of cars towed during the first three days to the number of cars towed during the remaining four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert his current height from inches to feet. Adam's current height is 40 inches, and since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert this to feet by dividing by 12:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet by \(\frac{1}{6}\) feet per year:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The correct answer is:

"Given the information, we can start by calculating the price of the gold jewel. Since the price of a diamond jewel \( D \) is $2000 and the price of a gold jewel \( G \) is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel, we have:

\[ G = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we know that the price of a silver jewel \( S \) is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel:

\[ S = G - 400 = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total price for all three jewels, we sum their individual prices:

\[ \text{Total price} = D + G + S = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total price for all three jewels is \( 4800 \) dollars."
"To determine the total number of stamps Max bought, we can break down the information given:

   \]
3. He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Therefore, the number of rose stamps is:
   \[
   19 - 9 = 10
   \]

Adding these together gives the total number of stamps:
\[
16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45
\]

Thus, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's define the variables:
- \( v_B = 55 \) miles per hour (speed of Bob)
- \( v_T = 70 \) miles per hour (speed of Tom)
- \( d = 75 \) miles (distance between Bob and Tom)

The relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap is the difference in their speeds:
\[ v_{\text{relative}} = v_T - v_B = 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The time \( t \) it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap can be calculated using the formula:
\[ t = \frac{d}{v_{\text{relative}}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ t = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

"Given the information provided, we can deduce the number of fish each person caught step by step. 

First, we know that Naomi caught 17 fish. According to the problem, Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. Therefore, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:

\[
\text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 = 11
\]

Next, the problem states that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we can determine the number of fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

\[
\text{Tommy's fish} = 11 + 3 = 14
\]

Thus, the number of fish Tommy caught is 14. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to ensure that the cost per class does not exceed $10. Given that the total cost for 10 classes is $60, we can calculate the maximum number of classes per class as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

For the parents' condition to be met, the cost per class must be at most $10:

\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):

\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means that if Manny misses 6 or fewer classes, the cost per class will be at most $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss is:

\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

Thus, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, we start by determining the number of customers each processes daily and then extend that to a weekly total.

1. **Daily Customer Count:**

"To determine how many miles Lynn ran, we start by noting that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times the distance Paisley ran, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

We are also informed that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Lynn's distance:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

Substituting the distance Reggie ran:

\[ 20 = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

To isolate Lynn's distance, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

So, the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet.

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for Bob to dig this volume. It is given that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"

\text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Price} + \text{King Cab Upgrade} + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 43,500
\]

Thus, the total cost of Bill's new truck is \(\boxed{43500}\) dollars."
"To determine Tim's annual income after his promotion, we need to calculate his new monthly salary and then find the total for a year.

1. **Calculate the new monthly salary:**
   - Tim's original monthly salary is $20,000.
   - He gets a 5% raise on his salary.
   - The raise amount is \( 20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000 \).
   - Therefore, his new monthly salary is \( 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \).

2. **Calculate the bonus:**
   - Tim also receives a bonus worth half a month's salary.
   - Half a month's salary is \( \frac{21,000}{2} = 10,500 \).

3. **Calculate the total monthly income:**
   - Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus
   - Total monthly income = \( 21,000 + 10,500 = 31,500 \).

4. **Calculate the annual income:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Annual income = Total monthly income \(\times\) 12
   - Annual income = \( 31,500 \times 12 = 378,000 \).

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year. The correct answer is **378,000**."
"To determine the total cost of James's wardrobe, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of suits:**
   James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750.

   \text{Total cost of suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of dress pants:**
   The cost of each pair of dress pants is 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   \[
   \text{Cost of each pair of dress pants} = \frac{750}{5} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   James buys 10 pairs of dress pants.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of dress shirts:**
   James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits.
   \[
   \text{Total number of dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30
   \]
   Each dress shirt costs $60.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of suits} + \text{Cost of dress pants} + \text{Cost of dress shirts}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \text{ dollars}

"Given the information, we can start by determining the total earnings for the first month. We know that the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the total earnings from green hats in the first month is:

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total earnings for the first month are:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

For the second month, the sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Thus, the total earnings for the second month are:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

To find the total earnings over the two months, we add the earnings from the first month and the second month:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to account for the total time he hired the carriage and the free hour he received. James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which totals 4 hours. Since he gets 1 hour of free carriage time, he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first hour is $15.
- Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous hour.

Let's calculate the cost for each of the 3 paid hours:
- The first hour costs $15.
- The second hour costs $15 \times 2 = $30.
- The third hour costs $30 \times 2 = $60.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on renting the hanger. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Expenses:**
   To find the annual expenses, we multiply the total monthly expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   15000 \times 12 = 180000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   The total cost for the first year includes the initial cost of the plane and the annual expenses:

"Given the information provided, let's break down the cooking times step by step:

1. The time to cook rice (\(R\)) is given as 30 minutes.
2. The time to cook pork (\(P\)) is 20 minutes more than the time to cook rice, so \(P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50\) minutes.
3. The time to cook beans (\(B\)) is half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \(B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) = \frac{1}{2} (50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40\) minutes.

To find the total cooking time for all the food, we sum the individual cooking times:
\[ R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations based on the information provided.

Let \( S \) represent the number of sheep and \( G \) represent the number of geese. We know the following:
1. Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
2. Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
3. The total number of animal heads is 20.
4. The total number of animal legs is 70.

From the information given, we can set up the following equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To solve this system, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep \( S \) is 15.

To verify, we can substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, let's check the number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's purchases, we need to break down the expenses step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. Therefore, the cost of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ \$5 + (0.20 \times \$5) = \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \text{ per pound} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week. Since he uses 1 pound of coffee per day, for 7 days, he needs:
\[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

The total cost of the coffee is then:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$42 \]

Additionally, Roger buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \$42 + \$2 = \$44 \]

Thus, the total cost of everything is:

"To determine the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we start by calculating the number of history teachers. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can find the number of history teachers as follows:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90
\]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
\]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[
\text{Total sleeping time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is \(\boxed{360}\) hours."

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we start by noting the total number of good days Christina had over the 30 days, which is 12. We then account for the distribution of these good days over the three periods:

- The first 8 days had 8 good days.
- The second 8 days had 0 good days.
- The third 8 days had 0 good days.

This accounts for \(8 + 0 + 0 = 8\) good days. We are also given the next three days:
- Day 29: 1 good day.
- Day 30: 1 good day.
- Day 31: 1 good day.

Adding these up, we have \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\) good days from the last three days. Therefore, the total number of good days is \(8 + 3 = 11\).

Since Christina had 12 good days in total, the number of good days left in the month is \(12 - 11 = 1\).

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation step by step.

First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow from 240 inches to 600 inches, we first calculate the additional height needed:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Given that the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can find the number of days required for this growth by dividing the additional height by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the bamboo will be 600 inches tall in 12 days. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the situation step by step.

Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means he has 1 toy per dog. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs 8 more toys to have one toy per dog. Therefore, he needs 8 toys initially.

After buying the toys, the number of dogs in the shelter becomes 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, he now needs 12 toys.

When James comes back again, 3 dogs have gone, so the number of dogs left is 12 - 3 = 9 dogs. Since each dog still needs one toy, he now needs 9 toys.

Adding up all the toys he needs:
- Initially, he needed 8 toys.
- After buying the toys, he needed 12 toys.
- When he came back again, he needed 9 toys.

The total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 + 9 = 29\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{29}
\]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Investment:**
   The total initial investment is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invested \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. **Frances's Investment:**
   Frances invested \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Frances's Investment:**
   After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   720 - 480 = 240
   \]

6. **Skyler's Investment:**

"To determine how much Karen earns in two days, we start by calculating her hourly wage. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate her daily earnings. Given that she works 3 hours per day, her daily earnings are:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 60 \text{ dollars/day} \]

To find out how much she earns in two days, we multiply her daily earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Karen earns in two days is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, we start with the information that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns. First, we calculate the number of hash browns produced per potato:

\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Next, we use this rate to find out how many hash browns can be produced from 96 potatoes:

\[ \text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

Therefore, the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes is 576."
"To determine by how much the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the 8 other adults:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of 8 adults} = 8 \times 80 \text{ kg} = 640 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. Add Jack's weight to the total weight of the 8 adults:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \text{ kg} + 640 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. Determine the difference between the total weight and the maximum load of the elevator:
   \[
   \text{Exceeding load} = 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}

"Given the relationships provided in the problem, we can solve for the number of cookies each person has step by step.

1. We know that Katarina has 68 cookies, and this is 5 less than what Max has. Therefore, we can find the number of cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's cookies:
\[ M = K + 5 = 68 + 5 = 73 \]

2. Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has by subtracting 12 from Max's cookies:
\[ C = M - 12 = 73 - 12 = 61 \]

3. Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. Therefore, we can find the number of cookies Summer has by adding 23 to Max's cookies:
\[ S = M + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96 \]

Now, we sum the number of cookies each person has to find the total:
\[ \text{Total} = K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"To determine the original length of the dress, we start with the information that the final length of the dress is 140 cm. This final length is the result of extending the original length by 50% and then adding an additional 20 cm.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm. The extension of the dress by 50% means adding \( 0.5x \) cm to the original length. Adding the lace trim of 20 cm to the extended length gives us the final length of 140 cm. Therefore, we can write the equation as:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Thus, the original length of the dress was 80 cm. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To determine the total time Chris took to mow his lawn, we need to consider the time he spent mowing each half of the lawn separately and then sum these times.

First, we know that mowing the entire lawn in ""turtle"" mode takes 60 minutes. Since he mows half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode, the time taken for the first half is:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that mowing the entire lawn in ""rabbit"" mode takes 40 minutes. Since he mows the other half of the lawn in ""rabbit"" mode, the time taken for the second half is:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time taken for both halves gives us the total time:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

"To determine the total amount Catherine pays, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit she buys and then sum these costs.

1. **Apples:**
   - She buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = $4.

2. **Bananas:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos * $2/kilo = $4.

3. **Oranges:**
   - She buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6.

Now, we sum the costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of apples} + \text{Cost of bananas} + \text{Cost of oranges} = \$4 + \$4 + \$6 = \$14

"Given the information, we have one set of twins and one set of triplets. Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

From the problem, we know:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = Tr + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \).

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substitute \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"

"To solve the problem, we first need to determine the cost of one candy. Given that Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for a total of $3.20, and each lollipop costs $0.40, we can calculate the total cost of the lollipops as follows:

\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the total cost of the four candies is:

\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Therefore, the cost of one candy is:

\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we need to find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:

\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:

\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies:

\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Thus, the total cost is $7.00."
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after ten years, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month:**
   Rong saves 20 coins per month.

2. **Determine the number of coins Neil saves per month:**
   Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:
   \[
   20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of coins each saves over ten years:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
   \[
   10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
   \]
   Rong saves:
   \[
   20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
   \]
   Neil saves:
   \[
   28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}

"To solve the problem, we first calculate the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20, so the total cost for the vaccines is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, we can write:

\[ x = 0.6 \times (\text{Total bill}) \]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ \text{Total bill} = 40 + x \]

Since \( x = 0.6 \times (\text{Total bill}) \), we substitute \( x \) in the total bill equation:

\[ x = 0.6 \times (40 + x) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 0.6 \times 40 + 0.6x \]

\[ x = 24 + 0.6x \]

Subtract \( 0.6x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.6x = 24 \]

\[ 0.4x = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 0.4:

\[ x = \frac{24}{0.4} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost of the heartworm check is $60. Now, calculate the total bill:

\[ \text{Total bill} = 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[ \text{Amount left} = 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - Each crate contains 5 bananas.
   - The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple.
   - Given that one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each crate contains 12 apples.
   - The price of one apple is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Each crate contains 7 oranges.
   - The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana.
   - Given that one banana costs $1.0, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - Summing the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges:
   \[
   5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0
   \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32.0}\)."

"To determine the number of 8-point bucks, we start by calculating the number of bucks. Given that 50 percent of the 50 deer are bucks, we have:

\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50\% \times 50 = 0.50 \times 50 = 25 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8-point bucks is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total points collected by the class, we first need to calculate the points collected by each student individually.

1. **Adam** has collected 50 points.
2. **Betty** collected 30% more points than Adam. Therefore, the points collected by Betty are:
   \[
   \text{Points collected by Betty} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Tom** has 30 points.
4. **Marta** collected 3 times more points than Tom. Therefore, the points collected by Marta are:
   \[
   \text{Points collected by Marta} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

Now, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 90 + 30 = 235
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:
\[
\text{Points missing} = 400 - 235 = 165
\]

Thus, the class is missing \(\boxed{165}\) points to go on the trip."

"To determine how far Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to find the turtle's speed. Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat runs at 15 feet per second, we can calculate the turtle's speed as follows:

\[
\text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds using the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the turtle's speed and the given time:

\[
\text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The correct answer is:

\[

"To determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to reach their goal of $6300, we start by noting that they have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. This means they need to raise an additional $4200 to meet their goal.

Given that they raise an equal amount each hour, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we find out how many more hours are needed to raise the remaining $4200:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Adding the initial 3 hours to the additional hours gives us the total number of hours required:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal is:
\[ 9 \]

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
   - 80% of this 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Calculate 80% of 40%:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 = 32\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total percentage of water used by Colorado City is 40%.
   - Subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes (32%) from the total percentage used by Colorado City:
     \[
     40\% - 32\% = 8\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is \(8\%\).

"To determine the total production of ice cream in 48 hours, we first calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so the production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).
- In 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so the production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).
- In 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Adding the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:
\[ 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \]

"To determine how much James saved by picking the blueberries himself compared to buying them at the store, we need to calculate the total cost for each scenario and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total cost James incurred for picking the blueberries:
- The cost to go picking is $20.
- The cost per pound is $1.5, and he picked 30 pounds.
- Therefore, the cost for the blueberries is \(30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45\).
- Adding the cost to go picking, the total cost for James is \( \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \).

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store:
- The cost per pound at the store is $2.5.
- He picked 30 pounds, so the cost at the store is \(30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75\).

Now, we find the savings by subtracting the total cost James incurred from the cost at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by converting the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we have:

\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} + 4 \text{ inches} = 96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches} \]

So, the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches. According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. Then, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, divide both sides by 9:

- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

The total number of spools is:
\[ 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of blue spools:
\[ 15 + 45 = 60 \]

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = 0.4 \]

Then, converting to a percentage:
\[ 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of blue spools of thread is \( 40\% \).

The correct answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."

\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We do this by adding their ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

\[
\boxed{87}

"To find the total weight of all the books Cindy is carrying, we need to sum the weights of each individual book:

- The weight of the math and science books is \(2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds}\).
- The weight of the French book is \(4 \text{ pounds}\).
- The weight of the English book is \(3 \text{ pounds}\).
- The weight of the history book is \(2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds}\).

Adding these weights together gives:
\[4 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 17 \text{ pounds}\]

Therefore, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is \(\boxed{17}\) pounds."
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we start by calculating the votes for candidate A. Given that candidate A got 20% of the votes and there were 100 voters, we can calculate the votes for candidate A as follows:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many votes candidate B received. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes and add it to candidate A's votes:

\[ \text{Additional votes for candidate B} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

So, the total votes for candidate B are:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, we need to find out how many votes candidate C received. The total number of votes is 100. Therefore, the votes for candidate C are the remaining votes after accounting for candidate A and candidate B:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (\text{Votes for candidate A} + \text{Votes for candidate B}) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - 50 \]
\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 50 \]

Thus, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris after Boris gives him 10 apples, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Apples Calculation:**
   - Boris starts with 100 apples.
   - Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck starts with \(100 - 23 = 77\) apples.

2. **Exchange of Apples:**
   - Boris gives 10 apples to Beck.
   - After the exchange, Boris has \(100 - 10 = 90\) apples.
   - After the exchange, Beck has \(77 + 10 = 87\) apples.

3. **Difference in Apples:**
   - The difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the exchange is \(90 - 87 = 3\).

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, let's calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

Next, let's calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

Then, let's calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we sum the water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used: \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
- Initial amount of water: 32 ounces.
- Water left: \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Thus, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine how many more books Clara has than Alice, we start by finding out how many books Steven has. Given that Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

Solving for Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books Alice has. Since Alice has 6 more books than Steven:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we first need to establish the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and it is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the items Cecelia bought. She purchased 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

1. **Cost of 10 gallon jars:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 10 gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of 16 half-gallon jars:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding these costs together gives us the total amount Cecelia spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 50 + 48 = 98 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is \(\boxed{98}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the total number of students and the number of students with specific hobbies. The class has 50 students in total. Out of these, 10 students like to bake and 5 students like to play basketball. The rest of the students, who are 35 in number, like to either play video games or play music.

Given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball, we can denote the number of students who like to play basketball as \(5\) and the number of students who like to play music as \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Since the total number of students who like to play video games or play music is 35, we can set up the equation:
\[ V + M = 35 \]
where \(V\) is the number of students who like to play video games and \(M\) is the number of students who like to play music. Substituting the value of \(M\):
\[ V + 10 = 35 \]
Solving for \(V\):
\[ V = 35 - 10 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \(25\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Initially, Jeremy saw 12 birds. When he threw a stone, he scared away one-third of these birds, which amounts to \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) birds. Therefore, the number of birds remaining after the stone was thrown is \( 12 - 4 = 8 \) birds.

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Thus, the total number of birds now in the backyard is \( 8 + 20 = 28 \) birds.

The final numerical answer is 28."
"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of students in each class:**
   - The total number of students in the two classes is 80.
   - Since each class has the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
     \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   - In each class, 40% of the students are girls.
   - To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
     \]

3. **Determine the number of boys in each class:**
   - Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the remaining students must be boys.
   - We subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
     \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."

"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom this week. She has:

- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

Adding these together gives:
\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Melissa has 28 animals to groom over the course of the week. Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days, we need to divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

So, we perform the division:
\[ \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine Mark's profit, we first calculate the total cost of the packs he bought. He purchased 3 packs at $1800 each, so the total cost is:

\[
3 \times 1800 = 5400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total value of the cards he received. He got one card worth $4000, another worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. The total value of these cards is:

\[
4000 + 1000 + (30 \times 50) = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the weekly savings, we first need to calculate the daily savings. The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each and now buys them for $0.4 each, selling 500 tomatoes a day.

1. **Calculate the daily cost from the old vendor:**
   \[
   \text{Daily cost from old vendor} = 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily cost from the new vendor:**
   \[
   \text{Daily cost from new vendor} = 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily savings:**
   \[
   \text{Daily savings} = \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the weekly savings:**
   \[

"Given the problem, we start by determining the number of marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean and Sean has 56 marbles, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Cal has. The problem states that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so we can express the number of marbles Cal has as twice the number of marbles Sean has:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

To find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have, we add the number of marbles each has:

\[ \text{Combined number of marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have is 336. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{336}\)."
"To determine how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups from 54 students, we first need to understand the feasibility of forming 12 groups of equal size.

Given that there are 54 students and we want to form 12 groups, we calculate the number of students per group:
\[
\text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group}
\]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, we need to consider the possibility of forming 6 groups instead.

If we form 6 groups, the number of students per group would be:
\[
\text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group}
\]

This is a whole number, so it is feasible to form 6 groups of 9 students each. To find out how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups, we subtract the number of groups we can form (6) from the desired number of groups (12):
\[
\text{Number of additional groups needed} = 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ groups}
\]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is 6.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months, we need to break down the rental pattern and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during a single weekday and a single weekend day:
- During weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs each day.
- During weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs each day.

Next, we need to determine the number of weekdays and weekend days in a single 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a single week.
- Therefore, in a single 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Now, we calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month: \(60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 20 \text{ days} = 1200 \text{ chairs}\).
- Total chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month: \(100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ chairs}\).

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
\[1200 \text{ chairs} + 800 \text{ chairs} = 2000 \text{ chairs}\].

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
\[2000 \text{ chairs} \times 2 = 4000 \text{ chairs}\].

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[
\boxed{4000}

1. **Initial number of bananas:**
   Gunther starts with 48 bananas.

2. **Arnold steals half:**
   Arnold steals half of the bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas stolen by Arnold} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 48 - 24 = 24
   \]

3. **Gunther adds 25 bananas:**
   Gunther adds 25 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas after Gunther adds 25} = 24 + 25 = 49
   \]

4. **Arnold steals another 12 bananas:**
   Arnold steals 12 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas left} = 49 - 12 = 37
   \]

5. **Gunther adds 6 more bananas:**
   Gunther adds 6 more bananas.
   \[
   \text{Bananas after Gunther adds 6} = 37 + 6 = 43
   \]

Thus, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we start by calculating the monthly cost per roommate. Given that the total monthly cost for electricity is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we divide the monthly cost by the number of roommates:

\[
\text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
\]

Next, to find the annual cost per roommate, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year, which is 12:

\[
\text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300
\]

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

"To determine the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now, we start by calculating the initial quantities sent:

- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses, which is \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.
- He also sent 4 dozen plates, which is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

Next, we account for the items that were returned broken:
- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

To find out how many glasses and plates are left, we subtract the broken items from the total items sent:
- Remaining glasses = \(96 - 10 = 86\).
- Remaining plates = \(48 - 6 = 42\).

Adding the remaining glasses and plates together gives us the total number of items Jeff has now:
- Total remaining items = \(86 + 42 = 128\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{128}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 \)

Thus, by the end, Lorraine has 107 buttons. The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{107}\)."
"To find out the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we can break down the information as follows:

- Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
- Joey played 1 match on Friday.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Adding these together:
\[ 2 \text{ (Monday)} + 1 \text{ (Friday)} + 4 \text{ (Saturday)} = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation. Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \( x \). Consequently, the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). Since the total number of people on the council is 33, we can set up the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x \):

\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we will calculate the number of students for each size and then sum them up.

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - Number of students needing XS shirts = 11

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of students needing S shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of students needing M shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of students needing L shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of students needing XL shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size of shirt to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

"To solve this problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

Given:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

"To solve the problem, we can break it down into a few straightforward steps:

1. **Determine the number of books Ahmed read:**
   - We know that Ezra read 300 books in one hour, and this is twice the number of books Ahmed read.
   - Therefore, if \( A \) represents the number of books Ahmed read, then \( 2A = 300 \).
   - Solving for \( A \):
     \[
     A = \frac{300}{2} = 150
     \]
   - So, Ahmed read 150 books.

2. **Calculate the total number of books Ezra read:**
   - Initially, Ezra read 300 books.
   - He decided to read an additional 150 books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books Ezra read is:
     \[
     300 + 150 = 450
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:**
   - Ahmed read 150 books.
   - Ezra read 450 books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books read by both is:
     \[
     150 + 450 = 600
     \]

Thus, the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed altogether is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"To determine Tanya's earnings for teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we'll calculate her earnings day by day.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each day.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ \text{Base earnings} = 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Since she teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, she qualifies for the additional $5:
\[ \text{Total earnings for Monday} = \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each day.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not qualify for the additional $5 per day since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ \text{Base earnings} = 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not qualify for the additional $5 per day, her total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \$60 \]

**Total earnings for both days:**
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total earnings for Monday} + \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \$305 + \$60 = \$365 \]

Thus, Tanya earned a total of \(\boxed{365}\) dollars for these two days of teaching."

"To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for to reach his goal of $135, we first calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants. Bennet sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, so the revenue from the eggplants is:

\[ 20 \text{ eggplants} \times \$3/\text{eggplant} = \$60 \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135. We subtract the amount he has already made from $135:

\[ \$135 - \$60 = \$75 \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for to make the remaining $75, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:

\[ \frac{\$75}{25 \text{ ears}} = \$3/\text{ear} \]

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the return trip is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back home is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the number of wheels left after Henry assembles the cars and motorcycles, we first calculate the total number of wheels required. 

For the cars, since each car needs 4 wheels and there are 57 cars:
\[ 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

For the motorcycles, each motorcycle needs 2 wheels and there are 73 motorcycles:
\[ 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of wheels needed:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Given that Henry has 650 wheels, the number of wheels left after assembly is:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

Thus, the number of wheels left is:
\[ 276 \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{276} \]"
"To determine the price of the laptop after a 20% discount, we start with the original price of $1000. A 20% discount means you save 20% of $1000. 

First, calculate 20% of $1000:
\[ 20\% \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

Subtract this discount from the original price:
\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Therefore, after applying the 20% discount, the price you have to pay is $800.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 800 \]"
"To determine the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions, we need to break down the costs step by step.

First, we calculate the number of movies in series. Since a third of the 600 movies are in series:

\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]

Next, we find the number of non-series movies:

\[ \text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Among these non-series movies, 40% are older movies:

\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

The remaining non-series movies are not older:

\[ \text{Number of non-older non-series movies} = 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we calculate the costs for each category of movies:
- The cost for the series movies, which can be bought at a discounted rate of $6 each:
\[ \text{Cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]
- The cost for the non-older non-series movies, which cost $10 each:
\[ \text{Cost for non-older non-series movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]
- The cost for the older movies, which cost $5 each:
\[ \text{Cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400 \]

Therefore, the total cost to replace the movies is:

\[ \boxed{4400} \]"

   - Pounds picked: 6
   - Total cost for apricots: \( 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00 \text{ per pound} = \$18.00 \)

Now, we sum the costs for all the fruits:
\[
\$12.00 \text{ (peaches)} + \$8.00 \text{ (plums)} + \$18.00 \text{ (apricots)} = \$38.00
\]

Therefore, Winston spent a total of \(\boxed{38}\) dollars on fruit."
"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance driven:
- The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- Distance driven = Speed × Time = 50 miles/hour × 6 hours = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked:
- The Llesis family hiked for 1.5 hours.
- The average speed when hiking is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half of the driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
- Therefore, the hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
- Distance hiked = Speed × Time = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
- Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

The final numerical answer is 330 miles."

"Given that four friends ordered four pizzas for a total of 64 dollars, and two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, we need to determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas, assuming they cost the same amount.

First, calculate the combined cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars each:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars, the combined cost of the other two pizzas is:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, each of these pizzas costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is:

"To determine the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we can break down the problem into two parts: the usual days and the special days.

First, let's calculate the number of rides on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes thrice a day.
- They do this for 5 days.

So, the number of rides on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of rides on the special days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) rides per day.
- They do this for 2 days.

So, the number of rides on the special days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the special days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Thus, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:

"To solve this problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given conditions. Let \( o \) represent the number of orange fish Bob bought, and \( w \) represent the number of white fish he bought. We know the following:

1. The total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so we have the equation:
\[ o + w = 17 \]

2. After adding these fish to his pond, the number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + o \) and the number of white fish becomes \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, which gives us the equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We can simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Next, we substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2w + 5 + w = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now, we substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

To verify, we check the conditions:
- The total number of fish bought is \( o + w = 13 + 4 = 17 \).
- After adding the fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- The number of orange fish is indeed twice the number of white fish: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is \( \boxed{4} \)."
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week:
   - Andy drives 5 miles one way to work.
   - He makes a round trip each day, so he drives \(5 \times 2 = 10\) miles per day.
   - He works from Monday to Friday, so he drives \(10 \times 5 = 50\) miles per week.

2. Determine the amount of gas consumed per week:
   - Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon.
   - Therefore, the amount of gas consumed per week is \(\frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week}\).

3. Calculate the cost of the gas consumed per week:
   - The price of gas is $3 per gallon.
   - Thus, the cost per week is \(5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week}\).

Therefore, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is \(\boxed{15}\) dollars."

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we start by calculating the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold based on the given fractions of the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:

\]

Now, we find the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs})
\]
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we first need to calculate the temperature difference that needs to be addressed. The pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees. Given that the temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than the day, we can calculate the night temperature as follows:

\[ \text{Day temperature} = 45 \text{ degrees} \]
\[ \text{Night temperature} = 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The temperature difference that needs to be raised to prevent the pipes from freezing is:

\[ \text{Required temperature increase} = 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, the number of logs needed to achieve the required temperature increase is:

\[ \text{Number of logs} = \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"

"To determine Jamie's total earnings for last Tuesday, we need to break down her work hours and calculate the corresponding pay.

First, we identify Jamie's regular hourly rate, which is $20 per hour. For any additional hours worked beyond the first 8 hours, she is paid at a special rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate. This special rate can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Special hourly rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Jamie worked a total of 11 hours on last Tuesday. Out of these, 8 hours are regular hours, and the remaining 3 hours are additional hours.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the regular hours:
\[ \text{Earnings from regular hours} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the earnings from the additional hours:
\[ \text{Earnings from additional hours} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we sum the earnings from the regular hours and the additional hours to find the total earnings for the day:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on last Tuesday."
"To determine the total number of lions in the enclosure, we can break down the information given:

- The number of female lions is 12.
- The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, which means there are \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) male lions.
- The number of lion cubs is 14.

Adding these together, the total number of lions is:
\[ 12 \text{ (female lions)} + 6 \text{ (male lions)} + 14 \text{ (lion cubs)} = 32 \text{ lions} \]

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"To determine how much money Mike will have left after purchasing the jeans, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the discounted price of the jeans. The original price is $40.00, and they are advertised 25% off. The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \]

2. Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price:
\[ \text{Sale price} = 40.00 - 10.00 = 30.00 \]

3. Subtract the sale price from the amount of money Mike has to pay with, which is $50.00:
\[ \text{Money left} = 50.00 - 30.00 = 20.00 \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20.00} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of new employees hired over three months:**
   The company hires 20 new employees each month. Over three months, the number of new employees is:
   \[
   20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of employees after three months:**
   The initial number of employees is 200. Adding the new employees gives:
   \[
   200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month:**
   Each employee is paid $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all employees each month is:
   \[
   260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of money paid to employees over three months:**

"To determine the total time Carrie and the choir will be caroling, we need to sum the durations of the songs ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells.""

First, we calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice.
- Each performance of ""Deck the Halls"" is 150 seconds long.

\[
\text{Total time for ""Deck the Halls""} = 2 \times 150 \text{ seconds} = 300 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time for ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once.
- Each performance of ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds long.

\[
\text{Total time for ""Jingle Bells""} = 1 \times 240 \text{ seconds} = 240 \text{ seconds}
\]

"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then their earnings for 20 hours.

First, let's find Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
1. **Initial hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, the raise:** $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, the raise:** $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Next, we calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours at each stage:
1. **Initial earnings (first 2 months):**
   \[
   10 \text{ hours/month} \times 2 \text{ months} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. **Earnings after the raise (first anniversary):**
   \[
   11.50 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 230 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up Billy's total earnings:
\[
400 \text{ dollars} + 230 \text{ dollars} = 630 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate Sally's hourly wage:
1. **Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's initial salary:**
   \[
   10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

We calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours:
\[
10.50 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 210 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
\[
630 \text{ dollars} - 210 \text{ dollars} = 420 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Billy will earn $420 more than Sally in 20 hours. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of trees planted, we start by calculating the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes, with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ \text{Total number of teachers} = 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of trees planted by the students and teachers.

Each student plants 1 tree:
\[ \text{Total trees planted by students} = 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees:
\[ \text{Total trees planted by teachers} = 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Finally, we add the trees planted by the students and the teachers to find the total number of trees planted:
\[ \text{Total trees planted} = 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:

"Bubbles currently has a total of 14 stuffed animals. To achieve a 30% ratio of stuffed goats, we need to determine how many additional stuffed goats, \( x \), she should buy. The equation representing this situation is:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to achieve a 30% ratio of stuffed goats among all her stuffed animals. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach the 30-hour goal, we first calculate the total hours she has already played. 

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since 2 weeks consist of \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days, the total hours played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total hours played in the last week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the last week gives:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach the 30-hour goal, we subtract the total hours she has already played from the goal:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."
"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
   - Time traveled: 2 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles.

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
   - Time traveled: 2 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles.

3. **Find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles.
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles.
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

After 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

"James buys a ring for his bride-to-be. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. He pays a 30% premium for it to be made. To find out how much he paid in total, we first calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium:

\[ \text{Total cost before premium} = \$600 + \$300 = \$900 \]

Next, we calculate the premium, which is 30% of the total cost before the premium:

\[ \text{Premium} = 0.30 \times \$900 = \$270 \]

Adding the premium to the total cost before the premium gives us the final amount James paid:

\[ \text{Total cost after premium} = \$900 + \$270 = \$1170 \]

Therefore, the final amount James paid is \(\boxed{1170}\)."
"To find the overall pass rate for the school, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's determine the pass rates for each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Pass rate} = \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \text{ or } 68\%
   \]

2. **Fourth-grade pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Pass rate} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \text{ or } 40\%
   \]

3. **Fifth-grade pass rate:**
   The fifth-grade pass rate is twice the fourth-grade pass rate:
   \[
   \text{Fifth-grade pass rate} = 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \text{ or } 80\%
   \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass students:**
   \[
   \text{Number of third-grade pass students} = 340
   \]

2. **Fourth-grade pass students:**
   \[
   \text{Number of fourth-grade pass students} = 40
   \]

3. **Fifth-grade pass students:**
   \[
   \text{Number of fifth-grade pass students} = 0.80 \times 400 = 320
   \]

Now, we sum the number of students who passed in all grades:

\[
\text{Total number of pass students} = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700
\]

The total number of students tested is:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000
\]

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \text{ or } 70\%

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we start by calculating the total number of glass chips he has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we need to find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Given that it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we have:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we first calculate the total amount of tea consumed by the students. 

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so the total tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea, so the total tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students drank. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 12 gallons. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many more butterscotch candies Dale needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Order and Sales:**
   - Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
   - He sold 150 butterscotch candies.

2. **Remaining Candies After Sales:**
   - Since he sold 150 candies but only had 100 ordered, he would have run out of the initial order and needed to order more to meet the demand.
   - Therefore, he sold all 100 candies he initially had and needed to order 100 more to replenish his stock.

3. **Total Candies Now:**
   - After ordering 100 more candies, Dale now has:
     \[
     100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (additional order)} = 200 \text{ candies}
     \]

4. **Total Candies Sold:**
   - Dale has already sold 150 candies.

5. **Candies Still Needed to Sell:**
   - To find out how many more candies Dale needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he now has:
     \[
     200 \text{ (total candies now)} - 150 \text{ (candies sold)} = 50 \text{ candies}
     \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 more candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"

   \[
   10
   \]

2. **Number of students at the end of each month:**
   - **End of January:**
     \[
     10 \times 2 = 20
     \]
   - **End of February:**
     \[
     20 \times 2 = 40

"To determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day, we start by calculating the total number of branches he climbed during the week. Given that he made $105 and each branch costs $0.25, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total money made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420
\]

Since this total was made over the course of a week (7 days), we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total branches by the number of days:

\[
\text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60
\]

Therefore, the average number of branches Felix climbed per day is 60. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine the total number of petals in the vase, we first calculate the number of petals Rose picks initially:

1. For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

2. For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

3. For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

4. For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of petals initially:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Rose then drops 1 flower of each type, which means she drops:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:

"To determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining marshmallows, we start by calculating the total number of marshmallows used and dropped. John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:

\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \text{ S'mores} \]

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. Therefore, the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ marshmallows} \]

The original bag contained 35 marshmallows. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is:

\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows} \]

Since each S'more requires one marshmallow, the number of S'mores each kid can have with the remaining 14 marshmallows is:

\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores} \]

Thus, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag. The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of quarters used by Jack and his three friends to play for 4 hours (240 minutes).

First, let's establish the time each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter.
- Each of the two worse friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes.
- The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time they play together:
- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- Each of the two worse friends plays for 10 minutes each, so together they play for \( 10 + 10 = 20 \) minutes.
- The better friend plays for 30 minutes.

Adding these times together, the total time played is \( 20 + 20 + 30 = 70 \) minutes. Since each quarter allows them to play for 20 minutes, the number of quarters needed is \( \frac{240}{20} = 12 \).

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 12 quarters. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the quantities of each ingredient in terms of a single variable. Let \( S \) represent the amount of salt used. Given the relationships:

1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

We can substitute \( C \) with \( S \) and \( F \) with \( S \). Therefore, we have:
- \( O = 2S \)
- \( F = S \)
- \( C = S \)
- \( G = S \)

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation, we get:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil used, which is \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Thus, the amount of oil used is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars, so he has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars left.
   - He gives away 16 cars, so he has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars left.

Thus, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is 16.

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how much each student raised, we start by calculating the total amount of money raised by the students. The total charity amount is $175,000, with $50,000 coming from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each of the 20 students raised. We do this by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we start by noting the time she spent walking on the first day, which is 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as she did on the first day, so she walked \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) hours.

Adding the hours from both days gives us the total time in hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

To convert this total time into minutes, we use the conversion factor that 1 hour equals 60 minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is \( 720 \) minutes. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{720}\)."
"To determine the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we can follow these steps:

2. **Additional Cars During First Break**: During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. Therefore, the total number of cars after the first break is:
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
3. **Cars Leaving During Lunch Break**: When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, half of the cars in the parking lot had gone. Therefore, the number of cars that left is:
   \[
   \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
4. **Cars Remaining During Lunch Break**: The number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break is:
   \[
   70 - 35 = 35
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is:
\[
\boxed{35}

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 3 \times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"To determine the total number of Easter eggs Cindy collected, we can break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs:

Thus, the total number of eggs Cindy has is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The cost per pound is $0.35.
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - Therefore, the cost for the weight of the book is \(4 \times 0.35 = 1.40\) dollars.
   - The cost per mile is $0.08.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - Therefore, the cost for the distance is \(20 \times 0.08 = 1.60\) dollars.
   - The total shipping cost is \(1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the refundable portion of the book's purchase price:**
   - The book cost $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - Therefore, the refundable amount is \(32 \times 0.75 = 24.00\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The total cost to Milly is the shipping cost plus the cost of the book.
   - The cost of the book is $32.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(32 + 3.00 = 35.00\) dollars.
   - The net loss is the total cost minus the refundable amount.
   - Therefore, the net loss is \(35.00 - 24.00 = 11.00\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{11}\)."

   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, the time spent writing songs per week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Therefore, the time spent on makeup per week is:
     \[
     15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

4. **Total time spent on TikTok-related activities per week:**

Finally, we add the base cost to the total additional cost:

- Total cost: \( 129 + 195 = 324 \)

Thus, the total cost for Angela is \(\boxed{324}\)."
"To determine how much money Roy has saved, we need to follow the information provided step by step.

First, we know that Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so we calculate Anthony's savings as follows:
\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Next, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives Roy's total savings:
\[
\text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Roy has is \(\boxed{42.00}\)."
"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships between the heights of mountains each person can lift step by step.

1. **Pompei's mountain height**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. **Saskay's mountain height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami's mountain height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. **Naruto's mountain height**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance across the highway, given that three kangaroos take 18 hours to do so.

First, let's establish the distance \(D\) across the highway. Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to travel this distance, and each kangaroo travels at a speed \(v\), the total distance \(D\) can be calculated as:
\[ D = 3v \times 18 = 54v \]

Next, we need to consider the speed of the turtles. Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \(\frac{v}{2}\).

Now, let's determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \(D\). Let \(t\) be the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \(D\). The total distance \(D\) can also be expressed in terms of the speed of the turtles and the time \(t\):
\[ D = 4 \left( \frac{v}{2} \right) t = 2vt \]

Since we know \(D = 54v\), we can set the two expressions for \(D\) equal to each other:
\[ 54v = 2vt \]

Solving for \(t\):
\[ t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"To determine the number of apple slices left, we start by calculating the total number of slices from the apples Adam slices. Adam slices 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the large apples is:

\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Adam slices 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. Therefore, the total number of slices from the small apples is:

\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices from the large apples and the small apples gives us the total number of slices:

\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices. To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices Adam eats from the total number of slices:

\[ \text{Number of students good at both math and English} = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Next, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students who are good at math only to the number of students who are good at both math and English:
\[ \text{Total number of students good at math} = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for each group and then see how many such groups can fit into the total available time.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes per group} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

We now need to determine how many groups can fit into the remaining 110 minutes:
\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to the original investment.

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%\)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times R \times T \]
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

Let's compute this step by step:
\[ 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]
\[ 675 \times 3 = 2025 \]

So, the simple interest earned over 3 years is $2025.

Next, we add the simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and the number of white shirts without collars.

First, we calculate the number of white shirts without collars:
- Total white shirts: 40
- White shirts with collars: 40 / 2 = 20
- White shirts without collars: 40 - 20 = 20

Next, we calculate the number of floral shirts without buttons:
- Total floral shirts: 50
- Floral shirts with buttons: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we find the difference between the number of floral shirts without buttons and the number of white shirts without collars:
- Floral shirts without buttons: 30
- White shirts without collars: 20
- Difference: 30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, the number of floral shirts with no buttons is 10 more than the number of white shirts with no collars. The final answer is 10."

"To determine the total number of goats left in both farms after the sales, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Count of Goats:**
   - Farm X has 55 goats.
   - Farm Y has 45 goats.

2. **Goats Sold:**
   - From Farm X, 10 goats were sold.
   - From Farm Y, twice as many goats were sold as from Farm X, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats.

3. **Remaining Goats:**
   - Goats left in Farm X: \(55 - 10 = 45\).
   - Goats left in Farm Y: \(45 - 20 = 25\).

4. **Total Remaining Goats:**
   - Total goats left in both farms: \(45 + 25 = 70\).

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."

   Each basket of green food costs $25.
   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 baskets of green food} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:**
   Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket.
   \[
   \text{Discount per basket of red food} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per basket of red food after discount} = 18 - 2 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 baskets of red food} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost:**
   Add the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food.

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Year:**
   The town builds 12 homes.
   \[
   \text{Homes built in the first year} = 12
   \]

2. **Second Year:**
   The town builds three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Homes built in the second year} = 3 \times 12 = 36
   \]

3. **Third Year:**
   The town counts the total number of homes built in the first two years and then doubles this total.
   \[

"To solve the problem, let's denote the ages of the individuals as follows:
- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mom.
- Let \( Y \) be the age of the younger person (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all our ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( Y \) and \( B \):
\[ S = Y - 2 \]

Next, we substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now we have:
\[ Y = B - 3 \]
\[ S = B - 5 \]

We substitute these into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now we can find \( Y \):
\[ Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

So, you are 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

**Day 0 (initial state):**
- Number of infected people: 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total number of infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total number of infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total number of infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

"To determine the total amount of tips received by Rafaela and Julieta, we start by calculating Rafaela's total tips. Given that each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we can calculate her total tips as follows:

\[
\text{Rafaela's total tips} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta received. The problem states that Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips, we calculate:

\[
10\% \text{ of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total tips gives us Julieta's total tips:

\[
\text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the total amount of tips they received together:

\[
\text{Total tips} = \text{Rafaela's total tips} + \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of tips received by Rafaela and Julieta altogether is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year.

1. **Claire's Badges:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges in a year.

2. **Amber's Badges:**
   - It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Since Claire earns a badge every month, Amber earns a badge every 2 months.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges in a year.

3. **Wendy's Badges:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges in a year.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber is \(36 - 6 = 30\).

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

1. Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.
2. Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.
3. Calculate the total number of banana bread slices.
4. Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Paige baked.**

Paige baked from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The total number of hours is:
\[ 6:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of banana bread loaves baked.**

Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves per hour. Over 5 hours, the total number of loaves baked is:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of banana bread slices.**

Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from 10 loaves is:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

**Step 4: Find out the total revenue from selling the slices.**

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. The total revenue from selling 80 slices is:

"Given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can determine the number of silver coins by setting up the equation:

\[ \text{Number of gold coins} = \text{Number of silver coins} + 30 \]
\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

Solving for \( S \):

\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

"Let's denote the number of books Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books, and Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books. The total number of books they have together is 85, so we can write the equation:

\[
(A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[
A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
3A + 37 = 85
\]

Subtract 37 from both sides to isolate the term with \( A \):

\[
3A = 48
\]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( A \):

\[
A = 16
\]

Now, since Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books, we substitute \( A = 16 \) into the expression:

\[
A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28
\]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{28}

"To determine the cost for David's purchase, we first need to find the cost per bottle of soda and per bottle of water.

For the soda:
- Seven bottles cost $21.00, so the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

For the water:
- Four bottles cost $8.00, so the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost for David's purchase:
- He wants to buy 3 bottles of soda, so the cost for the soda is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
- He also wants to buy 2 bottles of water, so the cost for the water is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Adding these together, the total cost for David's purchase is $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is $13.00."

"To determine the cost Isaias incurred to buy the chickens, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

2. Calculate the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

3. Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the desired profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[

"To determine the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. **Hair Service:**
   Iris spent $400 on her hair.

2. **Manicure:**
   The cost of the manicure is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the cost of the hair service.
   \[
   \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Pedicure:**
   The cost of the pedicure is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the cost of the manicure.
   \[
   \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of all the services:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of hair} + \text{Cost of manicure} + \text{Cost of pedicure}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the items she is purchasing.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}

   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

Therefore, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is \(\boxed{5}\) dollars."
"To determine the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts, we start with the information that the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts and includes a 15-minute encore, making the total runtime 65 minutes. Let's denote the usual runtime of her concerts as \( x \) minutes. Therefore, the runtime of the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes, and including the encore, we have:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Thus, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"To determine the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged, we start by calculating 20% of the total 50 microphones. This gives us:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

This means that 10 microphones will not be able to fit into pairs. Therefore, the number of microphones that can be paired is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, the number of pairs that can be arranged is:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Thus, the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total number of birds Jerry counts, we need to break down the information given and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

First, Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes.

Next, we calculate the number of birds flying overhead. The problem states that this number is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the number of birds nesting. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
\]

Then, we calculate the number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. Thus, we have:

\[
\text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Finally, we sum up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[
\text{Total number of birds} = \text{Number of birds nesting} + \text{Number of birds flying overhead} + \text{Number of birds feeding} = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34
\]

Therefore, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:

"To determine the speed of a whirligig, we start by understanding the relationship between the speeds of the different objects. We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of a thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

Thus, the speed at which a whirligig spins is 55 meters per second. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{55}\)."
"To determine the cost of one carrot per day, we start by summarizing the given information:

- Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $3.
- The total cost for these items every day is $11.

We can set up the equation to represent the total daily cost:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Where \( C \) is the cost of one carrot. Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

"To determine Mark's weekly earnings after the pay raise, we start by calculating his new hourly wage. Initially, his hourly wage was $10, and it was increased by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:

\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours each day for 5 days a week:

\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find his weekly earnings, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:

\[ 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Thus, Mark makes $480 a week.

"Given the information provided, we can deduce the amount Tasha made from mowing lawns. If she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times and was paid $6 for each mowing, then the total payment from mowing lawns is \( 6x \).

Tasha's total earnings from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns amounted to $80. Therefore, the amount she made from lemonade sales can be calculated by subtracting the total mowing earnings from her total earnings:
\[ \text{Amount from lemonade sales} = 80 - 6x \]

Without the specific value of \( x \), we cannot determine a numerical amount. However, if we assume \( x = 1 \) (as a common assumption if not specified), then:
\[ \text{Amount from lemonade sales} = 80 - 6 \times 1 = 80 - 6 = 74 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{74} \]"
"To find the weight of Harry, we need to follow the given information step by step.

First, we calculate Carl's weight. Since Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, we have:
\[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we determine Christian's weight, which is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:
\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, we find Harry's weight, which is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:
\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg. The correct answer is:

\[ 74 \]"
"To determine John's profit from renting his car, we start by calculating the total number of hours he rents his car out in a month. Given that he rents his car 10 times a month and each rental lasts 3 hours, the total number of hours rented per month is:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from these rentals. Since he is paid $25 per hour, his monthly earnings are:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750/\text{month} \]

To find the profit, we subtract his monthly car payment from his monthly earnings. Given that his car payment is $500 per month, his profit is:

\[ \$750/\text{month} - \$500/\text{month} = \$250/\text{month} \]

Therefore, the profit John makes on his car is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we start by noting that Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana, which means Anis rowed \(50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50\) miles.

First, we calculate the additional distance Anis rowed:
\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]
So, the total distance Anis rowed is:
\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:
\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is \(\boxed{110}\) miles."

"Sarah has 9 books. Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, which means Joseph originally had \(2 \times 9 = 18\) books. After losing 2 books, the number of books Joseph currently has is \(18 - 2 = 16\). Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To determine how many marbles Dean has left, we start by calculating the number of marbles he gives to Jamie. Dean has 30 marbles and he gives 1/5 of them to Jamie:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6
\]

So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie. Additionally, Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. The total number of marbles given away is:

\[
6 + 10 = 16
\]

Subtracting the total number of marbles given away from the original number of marbles, we find the number of marbles left for Dean:

\[
30 - 16 = 14
\]

Thus, the number of marbles left for Dean is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Given that Duncan's current age is 60, we can determine Adam's current age by working backwards from the information provided.

Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \(60 - 8 = 52\). According to the problem, this age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, four years ago, Adam's age was \(\frac{52}{2} = 26\). Therefore, Adam's current age is \(26 + 4 = 30\).

To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[30 + 8 = 38\]

Thus, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The correct answer is \(\boxed{38}\)."
"To find the total number of acres for both Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms, we start by calculating the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Given that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, we can determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm as follows:

First, we calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Next, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add the sizes of both farms to find the total number of acres:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"To determine how much money Colby earns in an eight-hour workday, we start by calculating the number of packages he completes per hour. The problem states that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, which can be calculated as:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages/hour} \]

Next, we find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Since Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes, we calculate his total earnings for the workday by multiplying the total number of packages by the hourly rate:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme Sudoku puzzle, we first need to calculate the duration of the extreme Sudoku puzzle. Given that a normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes and an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times as long, we can calculate the time for the extreme Sudoku as follows:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour, we can determine the number of half-hour intervals by dividing 180 minutes by 30 minutes:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since John drinks one bottle of water every half-hour, the number of bottles of water he drinks in 180 minutes is:

\[ 6 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, the number of bottles of water John drinks in that time is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of yellow balloons Benny threw bologna at. We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. We also know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna and that there were 20 red balloons.

First, we substitute the number of red balloons into the equation for the total pieces of bologna thrown:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]
Given \( R = 20 \):
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we solve for \( Y \):
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine the number of tune-ups Jon needs, we first calculate the total distance he drives in a month. Given that he drives 100 miles per day for 30 days, the total distance is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can calculate the hours worked each day and then sum them up.

- On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.
- On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Adding these together, the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days is:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works in all these three days is 23 hours."
"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent and then divide that by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[ \text{Amount each received} = \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Kira bought a total of 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges, which sums up to 14 pieces of fruit. After Lola ate 2 pieces, the number of pieces left is 14 - 2 = 12 pieces.

"To find the total number of students, we need to sum the students participating in each sport:

1. **Tennis**: There are 6 students.
2. **Volleyball**: Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are in tennis, the number of volleyball players is \(2 \times 6 = 12\).
3. **Soccer**: There are 16 boys and 22 girls, making a total of \(16 + 22 = 38\) students.

Adding the students from each sport together:
\[
6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56 \text{ students}
\]

Therefore, the total number of students is \(\boxed{56}\)."
"To determine the profit the class made from selling lollipops, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold:**
   Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   \[
   30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops:**
   Each lollypop was sold for $0.8.
   \[
   300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops:**
   Each lollypop was bought for $0.5.
   \[
   300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150
   \]

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   \[
   \$240 - \$150 = \$90
   \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"To determine the total number of pets Larry has, we can break down the information step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so the number of dogs is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so the number of rabbits is \(9 - 2 = 7\).
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so the number of fish is \(3 \times 7 = 21\).
5. He has a collection of gerbils that is 1/3 the number of fish, so the number of gerbils is \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\).

Summing up all the pets:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, the total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we first need to calculate the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat together in one day. Abby eats 2 slices per day, and Josh eats twice as much, which means Josh eats 4 slices per day. Therefore, together they eat:

\[ 2 \text{ slices (Abby)} + 4 \text{ slices (Josh)} = 6 \text{ slices per day} \]

Given that the loaf of bread has 24 slices, we can find out how many days the bread will last by dividing the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together per day:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices per day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

Thus, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days. The correct answer is:

"Martha collects shells every month starting from her 5th birthday and continues until her 10th birthday. To determine the total number of months she has been collecting shells, we calculate the difference in years and convert it to months:

- From age 5 to 10 is 5 years.
- Since there are 12 months in a year, 5 years is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months.

Therefore, Martha has been collecting shells for 60 months. Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is:

\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana brews in each row, and then find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row.

First, we calculate the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea. Since Lana has 27 cups and she uses 15 cups to brew cinnamon tea, the remaining cups are:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
These 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
So, she brews 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea in total.

Next, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea are in each row. Since she divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, the number of cups in each row is:
\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]
Since the cups in each row are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip given that he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and that each trip takes 4 hours.

First, we calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Since the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours and he makes 2 trips in that time, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:
\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we start by calculating the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool contains 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of water removed from the tank over 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we first need to calculate the total amount he has already spent on popcorn and candy. Given that popcorn costs $8 per tub and he had 2 tubs, the total spent on popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars. Similarly, since a box of candy costs $2 and he had 4 boxes, the total spent on candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars. Therefore, the total amount spent on popcorn and candy is \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

Next, we subtract this amount from his total monthly budget of $150 to find out how much money he has left for additional movie tickets. The remaining budget is \(150 - 24 = 126\) dollars.

Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday and 8 movies on other days, totaling 13 movies. Since it is the last day of the month and it is a Friday, he can only see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday, which costs $10. Therefore, the number of additional movies he can see is 1.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"To determine the total calories from the pastries Andrew baked, we start by calculating the calories for the mini versions of the cinnamon rolls and blueberry muffins. 

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of that, which is:
\[
\frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
\]

Similarly, a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of that, which is:
\[
\frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
\]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls:
\[
200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories}
\]

Then, we calculate the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins:
\[
300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories}
\]

Adding these together gives the total calories from all the pastries:
\[
40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories}
\]

Therefore, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[
\boxed{85000}
\]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the five days.

1. On Monday, she removed 39 Junebugs.
2. On Tuesday, she removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
3. On Wednesday, she also removed twice as many as on Monday, which is \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
4. On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
5. On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
39 + 78 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 78 = 195
\]
\[
195 + 48 = 243
\]
\[
243 + 57 = 299
\]

So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the five days is 299.

Next, we calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (5):
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we first calculate the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Speed} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 8 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \text{ miles per hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To determine the number of bouncy balls Sophie bought, we first need to calculate the total number of toys she had before purchasing the bouncy balls. The bag of building blocks contains 31 blocks, the bin of stuffed animals contains 8 stuffed animals, and the tower of stacking rings contains 9 multicolored rings. Adding these together gives:

\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls were in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:

\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Given the information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Including Maria's 1 water balloon, the initial total number of water balloons is \(8 + 1 = 9\).

Her mom then gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding the initial total to the additional balloons, the total number of water balloons becomes \(9 + 15 = 24\).

Therefore, the total number of water balloons the girls had is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"To determine the number of new tables needed, we start by calculating the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale. 

1. Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes of stuff:
   \[
   10 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ boxes/person} = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already:
   \[
   10 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. Adding these together gives the total number of boxes:
   \[
   50 \text{ boxes} + 10 \text{ boxes} = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff.

4. Calculate the number of tables needed:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

They already own 15 tables.

5. Calculate the number of new tables needed:
   \[
   30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ new tables}
   \]

Therefore, the number of new tables needed is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To determine the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney, we first calculate the total distance each of them spits their seeds.

For Zoey:
- She has 40 seeds.
- Each seed is spit 10 feet.
- Therefore, the total distance Zoey spits is \(40 \times 10 = 400\) feet.

For Sydney:
- She has 35 seeds.
- Each seed is spit 12 feet.
- Therefore, the total distance Sydney spits is \(35 \times 12 = 420\) feet.

Next, we find the sum of the total distances spat by both:
- Total distance spat by Zoey: 400 feet.
- Total distance spat by Sydney: 420 feet.
- Sum of total distances: \(400 + 420 = 820\) feet.

Finally, we calculate the average total distance:
- Average total distance: \(\frac{820}{2} = 410\) feet.

Thus, the average total distance spat is \(\boxed{410}\) feet."
"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total widget production and revenue for each machine over a month.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[
\$259200 - \$194400 = \$64800

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be the cost of the 24-hour option minus the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option.
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{250}

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we start by calculating the hay requirement for each type of livestock.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay required for the goats is:
\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds} \]

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is:
\[ 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

With 12 sheep, the total hay required for the sheep is:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the hay required for the goats and the sheep gives the total amount of hay Nate needs:
\[ 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total amount of hay Nate needs is:

"To determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy after his expenses, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate John's total earnings for the week:
\[ \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of gas from his earnings:
\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so subtract this amount from his remaining money:
\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, calculate the cost of 5 pencils, each costing 10 dollars:
\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtract the cost of the pencils from the remaining money:
\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, determine how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:
\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

Therefore, the number of 25 dollar pens John can buy is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To find the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and his brother, we can break down the problem into a few straightforward steps.

First, we calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled out. Craig spelled out 20 words, each with 15 letters. Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled out is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Next, we know that Craig's brother spelled out words with a total count of letters that is 50 more than Craig's total. Thus, the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled out is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

To find the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother, we sum the two totals:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"To determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left for herself, we start by calculating the total number of bottles she can redeem with her 9 coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles, so:

\[
9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. There are 29 pupils, and each student receives 2 bottles:

\[
29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles}
\]

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she has:

\[
900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles}
\]

Therefore, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[
\boxed{842}
\]"
"To determine the total charge for the job, we need to consider the following components:

1. The fixed visit fee: $40
2. The labor cost: $35 per hour, with 2.25 hours of labor
3. The cost of parts: $60

First, we calculate the labor cost:
\[ \text{Labor cost} = 35 \times 2.25 \]

Next, we add the visit fee, labor cost, and parts cost to get the total charge:
\[ \text{Total charge} = 40 + \text{Labor cost} + 60 \]

Let's perform the calculations step by step.

1. Calculate the labor cost:
\[ 35 \times 2.25 = 35 \times (2 + 0.25) = 35 \times 2 + 35 \times 0.25 = 70 + 8.75 = 78.75 \]

2. Calculate the total charge:
\[ \text{Total charge} = 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

Therefore, Patty charged:
\[ \boxed{178.75} \]"
"To determine how much money James was out, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount:
   \[
   10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150
   \]

2. Apply the 40% discount to the total cost:
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60
   \]
   Therefore, the total cost after the discount is:
   \[
   \$150 - \$60 = \$90
   \]

3. Determine the cost of the 5 CDs that James decides to sell:
   \[
   5 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$75
   \]

4. Calculate the net loss from selling these 5 CDs for $40:
   \[
   \$75 - \$40 = \$35
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money James was out is:
\[
\boxed{35}

"To determine Jen's total earnings, we need to calculate the revenue from each type of root crop and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the earnings from the yams:
- Jen has 6 yams, and each yam is sold for $1.5.
- Total earnings from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

Next, we calculate the earnings from the sweet potatoes:
- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes, and each sweet potato is sold for $2.
- Total earnings from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

Finally, we calculate the earnings from the carrots:
- Jen has 4 carrots, and each carrot is sold for $1.25.
- Total earnings from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

Adding these amounts together gives us the total earnings:
- Total earnings = $9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34.

Therefore, Jen will earn \(\boxed{34}\) dollars if she sells everything."
"To determine the total time James took to swim across the lake, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half the initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"Given that Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday, we need to calculate how many loaves of bread the bakery has. According to the problem, the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves of bread as Sam had last Friday. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[ \text{Bakery loaves} = 7 \times (\text{Sam's loaves}) - 40 \]

Substituting Sam's loaves (70) into the equation:

\[ \text{Bakery loaves} = 7 \times 70 - 40 \]

First, we calculate \( 7 \times 70 \):

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Then, we subtract 40 from 490:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{450} \]"
"Initially, Jasmine had 15 stickers. She lost 7 during playtime, leaving her with:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Then, her teacher gave her an additional 5 stickers, so she had:

\[ 8 + 5 = 13 \]

Thus, the final number of stickers Jasmine has is 13. The correct answer is 13."
"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we need to compute the commission from each newspaper separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each New York Times.
- Commission per New York Times = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.
- Total commission from New York Times = 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each Wall Street Journal.
- Commission per Wall Street Journal = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal = 10 * $1.20 = $12.

Finally, we sum up the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal = $3 + $12 = $15.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"Given the information provided, we can deduce the ages step by step.

1. Deanna's age is given as 26 years.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus's age is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points can be expressed as \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points can be expressed as \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 3A + 30 - 30 = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information: the book is 1.5 inches thick, and each inch of paper contains 100 pages when stacked. Since each page is printed on both sides, the thickness of the book corresponds to the number of pages in the stack of paper.

First, we calculate the number of pages in 1 inch of paper:
\[ 1 \text{ inch} = 100 \text{ pages} \]

Next, we extend this to 1.5 inches:
\[ 1.5 \text{ inches} = 1.5 \times 100 \text{ pages} = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Since each page is printed on both sides, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"To determine the total number of reports Vince stapled, we first calculate the total time he spent stapling reports. Vince started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. The time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM is 3 hours, and from 11:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 13 hours. Adding these together gives a total of 16 hours.

Next, we convert the total time from hours to minutes:
\[ 16 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 960 \text{ minutes} \]

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 960 minutes, we divide 960 by 15:
\[ 960 \text{ minutes} \div 15 \text{ minutes/interval} = 64 \text{ intervals} \]

Since Vince staples 30 reports per 15-minute interval, the total number of reports he stapled is:
\[ 64 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1920 \text{ reports} \]

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1920. The correct answer is 1920."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to account for her usual sleep duration, the time she spent sleepwalking, and the time she woke up early.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which totals 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \(8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Calculate the time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \(2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}\).

3. **Calculate the time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual at 5:55 a.m.
   - The usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Calculate the total time she was awake:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is \(7 \text{ hours and } 55 \text{ minutes}\).
   - Converting this to minutes: \(7 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 420 \text{ minutes} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 475 \text{ minutes}\).

5. **Calculate the total time spent sleepwalking and waking up early:**
   - Total time awake: 475 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Time waking up early: 5 minutes
   - Total time not sleeping: \(23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}\).

6. **Calculate the actual sleep time:**
   - Total sleep time: 480 minutes
   - Time not sleeping: 28 minutes
   - Actual sleep time: \(480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes}\).

Thus, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{452}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Given that he has two dozen measuring cups, and knowing that one dozen equals 12, two dozen equals:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, we calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we start by calculating the initial number of occupied beds. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of these beds are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

This means that initially, there are 200 beds occupied. Consequently, the number of unoccupied beds is:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Next, we need to account for the additional patients admitted due to the coronavirus outbreak. Over 2 weeks, there are 14 days, and 50 patients are admitted each day. Therefore, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is:

\[
\text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

Adding these 700 patients to the initial 200 occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900
\]

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Emails Sent**: Robyn sends 16 emails a day.
2. **Work Emails**: Out of these, 7 are work emails.
3. **Remaining Emails**: Subtract the work emails from the total emails to find the remaining emails.
   \[
   16 - 7 = 9
   \]
4. **Family Emails**: Two-thirds of the remaining emails are sent to her family.
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]
5. **Emails Left for Boyfriend**: Subtract the family emails from the remaining emails to find the emails sent to her boyfriend.
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3
   \]
6. **Boyfriend Emails**: One-third of the remaining emails after sending to her family are sent to her boyfriend.
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1
   \]

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can determine his age as:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To determine the actual number of people who attended the concert, we start with the information that Courtney reported 48 people, and this number is 20% more than the actual number. Let's denote the actual number of people as \( x \).

Given that 48 is 120% of the actual number, we can write the equation:
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Performing the division:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Given the information, we can establish the relationship between the number of balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey. Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 4J \) balls.

We are informed that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: The pirates dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: The pirates dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, resulting in a net increase of \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

By the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

4. **Fourth Day**: The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes by the end of the third day should be:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of corn chips shared among Amora, Lainey, and Collins. We know that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more corn chips than either of them. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of corn chips Collins received:**
   - Amora received 70 corn chips.
   - Lainey received 70 corn chips.
   - Collins received \(70 + 15 = 85\) corn chips.

2. **Calculate the total number of corn chips:**
   - Add the number of corn chips each person received:

"To determine the cost of the travel tickets, we start by noting that the supplies cost $400 in total. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. Therefore, we first calculate 50% of $400:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Adding this amount to the cost of the supplies gives us the total cost of the travel tickets:

\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Thus, the total cost of the travel is $600. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe as \( A \), by Stan as \( S \), and by Alex as \( X \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( X + S + A = 339 \):

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now that we have \( A = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[
S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can verify by finding \( X \):

\[
X = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Check the total:

\[
X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:

\[
\boxed{147}
\]"
"Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can start by defining the number of minutes per episode as \( M \). Thus, \( M = 20 \) minutes.

The number of episodes \( E \) is given by \( E = \frac{M}{2} \). Substituting \( M = 20 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ E = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, the total time John will spend watching the show is:
\[ \text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine the total distance the bird traveled, we need to calculate the distance for each segment of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is \(\boxed{446}\) miles."

3. **Brownies from Friends**: At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Total Brownies Received**: Summing up all the brownies received:
   \[
   12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Brownies Eaten During the Party**: During the party, 1.5 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

6. **Brownies Left Over**: Subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies received:
   \[
   66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten brownies)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we start by calculating each individual's age.

Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so:
\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:
\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Now, we sum the ages of all three family members:
\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of states in India is \( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries together is:
\[ S + \left( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ S + \frac{S}{2} + 4 = \frac{2S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + 4 = \frac{3S}{2} + 4 \]

Without a specific value for \( S \), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume the USA has 50 states, then:
\[ S = 50 \]

Substituting \( S = 50 \) into the equation:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 = \frac{150}{2} + 4 = 75 + 4 = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together is 79.

"To determine the total cost of both the red and blue cars, we start by calculating the price of the red car. Given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, and the price of the blue car is $100, we first find 40% of $100:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40 \]

Subtracting this discount from the price of the blue car gives us the price of the red car:

\[ \text{Price of the red car} = \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

Next, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$100 + \$60 = \$160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is $160. 

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Given the information provided, we can deduce the current ages of Emil's dad and brother based on the conditions given.

First, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]
So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

Next, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be twice the age of his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ B = 7 \]
So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

To find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:

"To determine the total number of servings of crawfish Joe has, we first need to calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days. 

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, which is:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of crawfish caught:
\[ 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Since each serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, the total number of servings is:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

Therefore, the number of servings Joe has is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how many students are leaving early, we start by calculating the number of football players. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players:

\[ \text{Number of football players} = 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

Next, we find the number of students who are not football players:

\[ \text{Number of students not football players} = 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band:

\[ \text{Number of students who are cheerleaders or part of the band} = 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of students who need to leave early is the sum of the football players and the students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band:

\[ \text{Total number of students leaving early} = 6 + 6 = 12 \]

"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers required to fill her flower bed. Each flower occupies 1 foot of space, and there is a 1.5-foot space between each pair of flowers. Let's denote the total number of flowers needed as \( n \).

The total space required for \( n \) flowers and the spaces between them is given by:
\[ n \text{ flowers} \times 1 \text{ foot/flower} + (n-1) \text{ spaces} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/space} = 111 \text{ feet} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ n + 1.5(n-1) = 111 \]
\[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n = 112.5 \]
\[ n = \frac{112.5}{2.5} \]
\[ n = 45 \]

So, Pat needs 45 flowers in total. Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy:
\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ flowers} \]

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost for the flowers is:
\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store is:
\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we can follow these steps:

"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first need to calculate the total amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they are planting 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they are planting 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we first calculate her monthly savings for shoes:

\[
\text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500
\]

Next, we determine her total savings for the year:

\[
\text{Annual savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000
\]

Given that each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we can calculate the number of pairs of shoes she can buy in a year:

\[

"To determine the total time Emily needs to peel and saute 90 shrimp, we can break down the problem into two parts: peeling the shrimp and sautéing the shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time required to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can find the time required by dividing the total number of shrimp by the rate at which she peels them:

\[
\text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the time required to sauté 90 shrimp. The problem states that Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To sauté 90 shrimp, we need to determine how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:

\[
\text{Number of sets of 30 shrimp in 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set of 30 shrimp takes 10 minutes to sauté, the total time to sauté 90 shrimp is:

\[
\text{Total time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ sets} \times 10 \text{ minutes/set} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we add the time required for peeling and sautéing to find the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and sauté 90 shrimp is 45 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{45}

"To determine the final temperature difference from the starting temperature, we need to calculate the net effect of the cooling and warming processes.

1. **Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: 6 degrees.
- Cooling on high: 12 degrees.
- Warming up: 4 degrees.

Net change in temperature:
\[ 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the room warms up by 14 degrees, it is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature. Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Given that Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years and Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old, we know that the comet's next appearance would be 75 years later, which is 60 years after Bill's father first saw it. Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it, we can calculate Bill's age at the second sighting as follows:

\[ \text{Bill's age at the second sighting} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old} \]

Since the comet's second appearance was 75 years after the first, Bill was 75 years old at the first sighting. Therefore, to find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet for the first time, we subtract 75 years from his age at the second sighting:

\[ \text{Bill's age at the first sighting} = 90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to sum up the checks for each category:

1. **Electric Bill Check**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month.
   - Number of electric bill checks per year: \(12 \text{ checks}\)

2. **Gas Bill Check**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month.
   - Number of gas bill checks per year: \(12 \text{ checks}\)

3. **Church Check**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month.
   - Number of church checks per year: \(2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}\)

4. **Pest and Lawn Service Check**: Buford writes a check quarterly (every 3 months).
   - Number of pest and lawn service checks per year: \(4 \text{ checks}\)

Now, we sum up all the checks:

\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \text{ checks}

"Given the information, we need to determine the number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Next, we know that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- The number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F = \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \).
- The number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \).
- The number of flights to Germany is also \( \frac{1}{4}F = 22 \).

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl individually and then summing these durations.

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Each howl lasts for 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) seconds.

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, we find the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote's howls.
   - Combined duration: \( 20 \) seconds (Tobias) + \( 40 \) seconds (Chikote) = \( 60 \) seconds.
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is 60 seconds.

4. **Combined Duration:**
   - Sum the durations of all three wolves.
   - Combined duration: \( 20 \) seconds (Tobias) + \( 40 \) seconds (Chikote) + \( 60 \) seconds (Igneous) = \( 120 \) seconds.

5. **Convert Combined Duration to Minutes:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - \( 120 \) seconds ÷ \( 60 \) seconds/minute = \( 2 \) minutes.

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."

   3 + 4 + H + W = 20
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   7 + H + W = 20
   \]

6. **Solve for \( H + W \):**
   \[
   H + W = 20 - 7
   \]
   \[
   H + W = 13
   \]

7. **Use the information about Helene's age:**
   Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. First, calculate the average age of the group:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]

   Since Helene is twice the average age:
   \[
   H = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

8. **Substitute Helene's age into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):**
   \[
   10 + W = 13
   \]

9. **Solve for \( W \):**
   \[
   W = 13 - 10
   \]
   \[
   W = 3
   \]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we first need to calculate the total amount Walter has collected so far. He has collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from his online fund, which totals to $2000. 

Next, Walter's friend contributes an additional $200. Adding this to the $2000 already collected gives us a total of $2200. The lawyer will donate three times the amount collected by everyone else, which includes the contributions from Walter's neighbors, his online fund, and his friend. Therefore, the lawyer's donation is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Lawyer's donation} = 3 \times \text{Total collected by everyone else} = 3 \times 2200 = 6600 \]

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6600}
\]"
"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we start by calculating the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the proportion of the watermelon that each adult and each child gets, given that each adult's slice is twice as big as each child's slice.

Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Let the volume of each child's slice be \( x \). Then, the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Since there are 4 children and 2 adults, the total volume of the watermelon can be expressed as the sum of the volumes of all slices:

\[
4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x
\]

This means the total volume \( V \) of the watermelon is \( 8x \).

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \).

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total volume of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we need to calculate the total time spent on inpatients and appointments and then subtract this from the total clinic hours.

First, we calculate the time spent on inpatients:
- Doctor Jones has 9 inpatients.
- Each inpatient visit takes 20 minutes.
- Therefore, the total time spent on inpatients is \(9 \times 20 = 180\) minutes.

Next, we convert the time spent on inpatients from minutes to hours:
- \(180\) minutes is equivalent to \(180 \div 60 = 3\) hours.

Then, we calculate the time spent on appointments:
- Doctor Jones has 10 appointments.
- Each appointment takes 30 minutes.
- Therefore, the total time spent on appointments is \(10 \times 30 = 300\) minutes.

We convert the time spent on appointments from minutes to hours:
- \(300\) minutes is equivalent to \(300 \div 60 = 5\) hours.

Now, we add the time spent on inpatients and appointments:
- Total time spent on inpatients and appointments is \(3 + 5 = 8\) hours.

Finally, we subtract the total time spent on inpatients and appointments from the total clinic hours:
- Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic.
- Therefore, the time left for updating records is \(9 - 8 = 1\) hour.

Thus, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time required for all the steps and then subtract this total from the desired serving time of 5:00 pm.

The steps and their respective times are:
1. Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
2. Baking the cake: 30 minutes
3. Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

First, we sum up all these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete all the steps. She wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest start time, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is:
\[ 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2:00 \text{ pm}} \]"
"To determine the number of chocolate bars in a box, let's denote the number of chocolate bars in a box as \( x \).

Given that Lisa sold \( 3.5 \) boxes and Peter sold \( 4.5 \) boxes, together they sold a total of \( 64 \) chocolate bars. This can be expressed as:
\[ 3.5x + 4.5x = 64 \]

Combining the terms on the left side, we get:
\[ 8x = 64 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 8 \):
\[ x = \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is \( 8 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider both the fixed and variable costs associated with each session.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, which is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions per month is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) sessions.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month is the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is \(40 \times 12 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Given the problem, we need to determine the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha.

First, we calculate the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:
\[
4p = 64 \implies p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Next, we calculate the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha:
\[
7m = 56 \implies m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha from the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Therefore, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To determine the total number of porcupines in the park after a year, we start by calculating the number of female porcupines. Given that the total population is 50 and the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we can calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Initially, there are 50 porcupines. After a year, the total number of porcupines will be the initial number plus the number of babies born:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool based on the cost per gallon.

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Pool

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

### Step 2: Convert Volume to Gallons

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Gallons} = V \times 5.9 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Cost

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) can be calculated as:

\[ C = \text{Gallons} \times 0.10 \]

Let's perform the calculations step by step.

#### Step 1: Calculate the Volume

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]
\[ V = 25 \times 56 \]
\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

#### Step 2: Convert Volume to Gallons

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Cost

\[ C = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ C = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we start by identifying the number of each color of stick.

First, we know there are 9 red sticks.

Next, we calculate the number of blue sticks. The problem states that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is:
\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Then, we find the number of yellow sticks. The problem indicates that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Thus, the number of yellow sticks is:
\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Finally, to find the total number of sticks, we sum the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:
\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of sticks is 34. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo, traveling at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

For Shandy, traveling at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours:
\[ \text{Distance} = 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find the difference in the distances traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 230 \]"

   \]

2. **Students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students:**
   \[
   \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875

"To determine the remaining capacity of the tank, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days and then subtract this from the tank's total capacity.

### Day 1:
- **Wanda's contribution**: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
  \[
  \text{Wanda's contribution} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- **Ms. B's contribution**: \( \frac{3}{4} \) of Wanda's contribution.
  \[
  \text{Ms. B's contribution} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- **Total water pumped on Day 1**: 
  \[
  \text{Total on Day 1} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### Day 2:
- **Wanda's contribution**: \( \frac{2}{3} \) of her contribution on Day 1.
  \[
  \text{Wanda's contribution on Day 2} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- **Ms. B's contribution**: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of her contribution on Day 1.
  \[
  \text{Ms. B's contribution on Day 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- **Total water pumped on Day 2**: 
  \[
  \text{Total on Day 2} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### Total water pumped in two days:
\[
\text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Remaining capacity of the tank:

\text{Remaining capacity} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
\]

The remaining capacity of the tank is \(\boxed{6000}\) gallons."
"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the information given.

First, we know that after 8 hours, the power bank has 28% of its initial charge remaining. This means that the charge has been reduced by 72% over 8 hours. The charge reduction pattern changes after 5 hours, but we can still use the information about the charge remaining after 8 hours to find the initial charge.

Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as \( C \).

After 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, the charge remaining after 5 hours is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

After another 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, the charge remaining after these additional 3 hours is:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \]

We know that after 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, so:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

We need to calculate \( 0.91^5 \) and \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.656 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So,
\[ 0.656 \times 0.817 \approx 0.534 \]

This means:
\[ C \times 0.534 = 0.28 \]
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.534} \approx 0.524 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 52.4%.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52.4\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up for the down payment on a $10,000 car, we first calculate her weekly earnings. Janet earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total hourly wage is $25. Given that she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are:

\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she needs to save to buy the car. The down payment for the car is 20% of $10,000:

\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first calculate the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Summing these costs gives the total spent so far:
Total spent = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend initially. After purchasing the fruits, the remaining money is:
Remaining money = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. Therefore, the number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Thus, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is 3."
"To determine how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we start by calculating the total number of pieces of sweets in the box. Since the box contains 15 packs and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs are to be distributed equally among her 10 friends. Therefore, each friend receives:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To determine the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we can use the formula for compound interest, which is also applicable for calculating compound growth. The formula is:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 + r)^t \]

Given:
- \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars (initial price)
- \( r = 0.05 \) (5% expressed as a decimal)
- \( t = 3 \) years

Substituting the given values into the formula:

\[ P(3) = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Now, calculate \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \]
\[ (1.05)^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P(3) = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P(3) \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P(3) \approx 139 \]

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately $139."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded. We know she uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums. Additionally, we know that 3 albums are for selfies only and 2 albums are for portraits only.

First, let's calculate the number of pictures per album:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Given that 3 albums are for selfies only, the number of selfies is:
\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

Similarly, since 2 albums are for portraits only, the number of portraits is:
\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

However, this total does not match the given total of 27. This discrepancy suggests that the albums for selfies and portraits are not entirely separate but share some pictures. Given the problem's context, it's reasonable to assume that the 3 albums for selfies and the 2 albums for portraits are part of the same 8 albums, and the remaining 3 albums are for other categories.

If we assume the simplest distribution where the 3 albums for selfies and the 2 albums for portraits are the only ones that are not shared, then the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

But since the problem states the total is 27, we need to re-evaluate the distribution. Given the problem's constraints, the most plausible distribution is that the 3 albums for selfies and the 2 albums for portraits are the only ones that are not shared, and the remaining 3 albums are for other categories.

Thus, the correct number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

However, since the problem states the total is 27, the correct answer based on the given constraints is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading, we start by finding the time it takes him to read one page. Given that he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, the time per page is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, we calculate the total time for reading 18 pages by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the current number of guests in the hotel, we need to account for the changes in the number of guests step by step.

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.

2. **Guests who checked out early:**
   24 guests checked out early.

   \[
   100 - 24 = 76

   40\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
   \]

3. **Number of average and difficult questions:**
   Since 40% are easy, the remaining 60% are equally divided between average and difficult questions:
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.60 \times 60 = 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average questions} = \text{Difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

4. **Aries's performance on easy questions:**
   Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions correct:
   \[
   75\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.75 \times 24 = 18
   \]

5. **Aries's performance on average and difficult questions:**
   Aries is sure to get half of the average and difficult questions correct:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 18 = 9
   \]

6. **Total number of questions Aries is sure to get correct:**
   \[
   18 \text{ (easy)} + 9 \text{ (average)} + 9 \text{ (difficult)} = 36
   \]

Thus, the total number of points Aries is sure to get is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"Given the problem, we start by defining the variables and relationships provided. Let \( S \) represent the price of a small stuffed animal, which is given as $4. Consequently, the price of a large stuffed animal, \( L \), is three times that of a small one, so \( L = 3 \times 4 = 12 \) dollars.

Let \( x \) be the number of large stuffed animals sold. Then, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \). The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as the sum of the earnings from large and small stuffed animals:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = (x \times L) + (2x \times S) \]
\[ 120 = (x \times 12) + (2x \times 4) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \( x = 6 \), the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week, we start by calculating the daily total of sandwiches consumed. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches are consumed in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches per week} \]

Thus, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{77} \]"
"To determine how much money Suzanne has left after her earnings and expenses, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate her total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes:
- She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are:
  \[
  80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- She sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are:
  \[
  60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Adding these together gives her total earnings:
  \[
  80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, she gave $10 to each of her two sisters, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings gives:
\[
320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"To determine how many eggs the friends found, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins: \(30 + 30 = 60\).
2. Subtract the eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs hidden: \(100 - 60 = 40\).
3. Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, we subtract the 10 eggs that were not found by the friends from the remaining eggs: \(40 - 10 = 30\).

Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - Calculate 50% of 12 pounds: \(0.5 \times 12 = 6\) pounds.
   - Add this to the 12 pounds: \(12 + 6 = 18\) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a day:**
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a day:**
   - Multiply the daily ore mining rate by the number of dwarves: \(40 \times 18 = 720\) pounds per day.

4. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Multiply the daily ore mining rate by the number of days: \(720 \times 30 = 21600\) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month is 21600 pounds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{21600}

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can use the fact that the prices are proportional. Let's start by calculating the price per sandwich for the first two packages:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old bedroom for $1000, which means he effectively pays $2000 for the new set. He needs to pay 10% of this amount per month. To find the monthly payment, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To determine the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we need to account for the changes in the number of balloons she had.

Initially, Sally had:
- 25 red balloons
- 7 green balloons
- 12 yellow balloons

First, we calculate the number of red balloons that burst due to the gust of wind. Since 40% of the 25 red balloons burst, we have:
\[
0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst}
\]
Thus, the number of red balloons remaining is:
\[
25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons}
\]

Next, Sally accidentally released half of the yellow balloons. Since she initially had 12 yellow balloons, the number of yellow balloons released is:
\[
0.50 \times 12 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released}
\]
Therefore, the number of yellow balloons remaining is:
\[
12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons}
\]

Sally then found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons. The number of blue balloons added is:
\[
0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons}
\]

Finally, we sum the remaining balloons:
\[
15 \text{ (red)} + 7 \text{ (green)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 34 \text{ balloons}
\]

Thus, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is:
\[
\boxed{34}
\]"
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider all the scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 100% or 1.00 (since he would have to turn it in if he doesn't get an extension)

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario: 60% (since 60% of the time he doesn't get an extension and thus has to turn it in)

The total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:

\[ 0.50 + 0.60 = 1.10 \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 1, we need to normalize this to a percentage:

\[ \frac{1.10}{2} = 0.55 \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ 0.55 \times 100 = 55\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine how many tickets each graduate will receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of seats that are already accounted for.
2. Subtract the accounted seats from the total capacity to find out how many seats are left for graduates and their guests.
3. Divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Total seats in the Fine Arts Center: 6000
2. Seats for graduates: 950
3. Seats for faculty: 300

Total seats accounted for:
\[ 950 + 300 = 1250 \]

Next, we subtract the accounted seats from the total capacity to find the remaining seats:
\[ 6000 - 1250 = 4750 \]

Now, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive:
\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate will receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the sizes of the jelly beans and then calculate the number of small beans based on the given information.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles needed:**
   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet.
   - The number of bottles is calculated by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Determine the time to set off each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle, he will go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The time to go from one bottle to the next is 5 seconds.
   - Since there are 7 intervals, the total time is:
     \[
     7 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 35 \text{ seconds}

"To determine how much money Amor will have left after purchasing the cheese, we first calculate the total cost of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese she buys.

The cost of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound, and she buys 2 pounds:
\[
2 \text{ pounds} \times 11 \text{ dollars/pound} = 22 \text{ dollars}
\]

The cost of mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound, and she buys 3 pounds:
\[
3 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of the cheese:
\[
22 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she will have left after the purchase, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:

\]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is \(\boxed{10}\) dollars."
"To determine how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the income he lost while in college, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount borrowed during college:** Jim borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount borrowed is:
   \[
   50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
   \]

2. **Determine Jim's post-college income:** His original income was $25,000 per year, and his income tripled after college, so his post-college income is:
   \[
   25,000 \times 3 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total income Jim would have earned if he had worked the entire time:** He worked for 4 years in college and 4 years after college, for a total of 8 years. Therefore, the total income he would have earned is:
   \[
   75,000 \times 8 = 600,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount of money Jim needs to earn to repay the loans and make up for the lost income:** The total amount he needs to earn is the total income he would have earned minus the amount he borrowed:
   \[
   600,000 - 200,000 = 400,000
   \]

5. **Determine how long it will take to earn the remaining amount:** To find out how many years it will take to earn $400,000 at his post-college income of $75,000 per year, we divide the total amount needed by his annual income:
   \[
   \frac{400,000}{75,000} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33
   \]

Since Jim cannot work a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number, which means it would take him 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs, we start by calculating the dimensions of each piece of fabric. The bed measures 6 feet in length and 8 feet in width. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Thus, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric using the formula for the area of a rectangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{Area} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To determine the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we will calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   The number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters on Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17
   \]
   First, calculate one-fifth of 425:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
   \]
   Then add 17:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday:**
   The number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters on Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5
   \]
   First, calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then add 5:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

4. **Total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209
   \]
   Adding these numbers together:
   \[
   425 + 102 = 527
   \]
   \[
   527 + 209 = 736
   \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is \(\boxed{736}\)."

"To determine the average amount lost by Johnny's dad over the three races, we need to follow these steps:

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. Therefore, the amount won in the second race is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Since he won $11, he did not lose any money in this race, but rather won $11.

3. **Third Race:**
   He lost 1.5 times the amount he won in the second race. Since he won $11 in the second race, the amount lost in the third race is:
   \[
   1.5 \times 11 = 16.5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost over the three races:
- Amount lost in the first race: $5
- Amount lost in the third race: $16.5
- Total amount lost: \(5 + 16.5 = 21.5 \text{ dollars}\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average amount lost per race: \(\frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, the average amount lost per race is \(\boxed{7.1667}\)."
"To determine the total population in South America, we need to follow a straightforward calculation. We know there are 26 countries in South America, and each country has 5 cities. Each city has a population of 1000 people.

First, we calculate the total number of cities in South America:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we calculate the total population by multiplying the number of cities by the population per city:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total population in South America is:
\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"To determine the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their growth over the summer, we first need to convert Xavier's initial height from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, Xavier's initial height of 4 feet is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so his current height is:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches over the summer, so his current height is:

\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier now is:

\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is \(\boxed{1}\) inch."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

Given:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the total number of days the painters worked. Since the painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day for 3 weeks, and there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days worked is:
\[ 3 \times 7 \times \frac{3}{8} = 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours worked by all painters. Since each painter works \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day, the total number of hours worked by all 4 painters is:
\[ 7.875 \times 4 = 31.5 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, to find out how many hours each painter worked, we divide the total hours by the number of painters:
\[ \frac{31.5}{4} = 7.875 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, each painter put in 7.875 hours of work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.875 \]"

- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can set up the equation as follows:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To combine the terms involving \( x \), we convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[
2x = \frac{4x}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to account for the annual depreciation of 21%, which means the car retains 79% of its value each year. Starting from the initial price of $20,000 in 2007, we can calculate the price for each subsequent year up to 2010.

1. **2007 to 2008:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800
   \]

2. **2008 to 2009:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2009} = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12522
   \]

3. **2009 to 2010:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2010} = 12522 \times 0.79 = 9830.18
   \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9830.18.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9830.18}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of people on the train at the final stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train. Twice that number, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) people, board the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110

Therefore, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear.

The final answer is \(\boxed{55}\)."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we first need to calculate the number of tiles required.

Each tile has a side length of 1 ft, so each tile covers an area of \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).

The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt. Therefore, the number of tiles needed is equal to the total area of the kitchen floor, which is 200 tiles.

Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 200 \times 12 = 2400
\]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{2400}\)."
"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the increased monthly cost due to the accident.
2. Determine the annual cost based on the increased monthly cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the increased monthly cost.**

The normal monthly cost is $120. Since the cost is 60% more due to the accident, we need to find 60% of $120 and add it to the normal cost.

\[ \text{Increased cost per month} = 120 \times \frac{60}{100} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72 \]

**Step 2: Determine the annual cost.**

The increased monthly cost is $72. To find the annual cost, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 72 \times 12 = 864 \]

So, James pays $864 a year for the insurance.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{864} \]"
"To determine the number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Twin Beds:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds.
   - Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
     \]

2. **King Size Bed:**
   - Greg has 1 king size bed.
   - Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
     \]

3. **Total Loads Per Week:**
   - Total loads per week = Loads for twin beds + Loads for king size bed
   - Total loads per week = 2 loads + 1 load = 3 loads

4. **Total Loads Per Year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total loads per year = Loads per week × Weeks per year

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by Imma's cats per day.
2. Determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last based on the daily consumption.

First, let's calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day:
- Imma has 3 cats.
- Each cat is fed 60 grams of cat food twice a day.

So, the amount of cat food one cat consumes per day is:
\[ 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams} \]

Since there are 3 cats, the total amount of cat food consumed by all cats per day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day} \]

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of slices each person ate based on the given information. We know that Becky ate 10 slices, which is 3 more slices than Jake. Therefore, we can calculate the number of slices Jake ate as follows:

\[ \text{Jake's slices} = \text{Becky's slices} - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake. Thus, we can calculate the number of slices Silvia ate as:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia. Since each pizza has 8 slices and there are 4 pizzas, the total number of slices is:

\[ \text{Total slices} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

To find the total slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we sum the slices each of them ate:

\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Consequently, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of these two parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to sum up the individual costs:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200

"To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of emails that require a response each day. Since 20% of the 80 emails do not require a response, 80% of the emails do require a response.
   \[
   \text{Number of emails requiring a response per day} = 80 \times (1 - 0.20) = 80 \times 0.80 = 64
   \]

2. To find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails requiring a response per day by 5.
   \[
   \text{Number of emails requiring a response in a 5-day work week} = 64 \times 5 = 320
   \]

Therefore, the number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week is 320."

Now, we sum these numbers:
\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Adding them step by step:
\[
32 + 64 = 96
\]
\[
96 + 96 = 192

"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first sum the scores of all the tests. The scores from the first three tests are 100, 100, and 100, and the score from the fourth test is 80. Adding these together gives:

\[ 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

Next, we count the number of tests, which is 4. To find the average score, we divide the total sum of the scores by the number of tests:

\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{95} \]"
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we start by calculating the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
So, the number of pizzas left for the glee club is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, we calculate the number of pizzas ordered by the football team, which is twice the number ordered by the glee club:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
Thus, the number of pizzas left for the football team is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Adding the pizzas left from both groups gives us the total number of pizzas remaining:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total number of pizzas left is 14."
"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we start by calculating the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. Given that he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he plans to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, and he is sending 700 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, and he is sending 1400 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"To determine the number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches, we start by calculating the number of sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

After Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches, the number of remaining sub sandwiches is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Then, Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches, so the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

\[ 24 \]

The correct answer is 24."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
2. Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.
3. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the successful trucks.

Initially, Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks. A quarter of these trucks had mechanical failures:

\[
\text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
\text{Number of successful trucks} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 successful trucks is:

\[
\text{Total tons of fertiliser delivered} = 15 \times 20 = 300
\]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the given promotion, we need to consider the promotion details and the cost per pound of butter.

First, Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off,"" which means for every 2 pounds of butter purchased, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

Let's calculate the number of sets of 2 pounds of butter Dennis needs to buy:
\[
\text{Number of sets of 2 pounds} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
\]

For each set of 2 pounds, Dennis only pays for 1 pound at the full price of $4.00 per pound:
\[
\text{Cost per set} = 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$4.00
\]

Since Dennis needs 3 sets:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ sets} \times \$4.00 \text{ per set} = \$12.00
\]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[

"Let's revisit the problem with a clearer approach. Initially, both Maggie and Riza had $60 each. Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Amount spent by Maggie} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Maggie has left is:

\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Similarly, Riza spent one-third of her money, which is:

\[ \text{Amount spent by Riza} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]

Thus, the amount of money Riza has left is:

\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Adding the remaining amounts of money that Maggie and Riza have left, we get:

\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:

   - The second train leaves in 60 minutes (30 + 30).
   - The third train arrives in 60 + 60 = 120 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves in 120 minutes.
   - The fourth train arrives in 120 + 20 = 140 minutes.

Paul needs to board the fourth train, which arrives at 140 minutes after the first train arrives. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, Paul will wait for the fourth train for 140 - 10 = 130 minutes.

Therefore, the total time Paul will wait for his train is **130 minutes**."
"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks, we start by calculating the number of toothpicks she has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie needs a total of 200 toothpicks. Subtracting the 120 toothpicks she has already saved from the total required:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, the number of additional weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks is:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

   The original price of the watch is $2000. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]

2. **Calculate the price Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch for:**
   Mr. Rogers' friend sold the watch at 120% of the price Mr. Rogers paid.
   \[
   \text{Price Mr. Rogers' friend sold} = 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]

3. **Determine the discount percentage Mr. Rogers' friend received:**
   The original price of the watch is $2000, and Mr. Rogers' friend sold it for $1800. The discount amount is:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]
   The discount percentage is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend from the original price is \(\boxed{10\%}\)."

"To determine the total time it took James to reach the store, we can break down his journey into two segments. First, he walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, at a speed of 4 miles per hour. The time taken for this segment is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Time for the first segment} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he had to walk back home, which is another 2 miles, at the same speed of 4 miles per hour. The time taken for this segment is:

\[ \text{Time for the second segment} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the times for both segments gives the total time:

\[ \text{Total time} = 0.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we can follow these steps:

First, calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas individually:
- Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch contains 4 bananas, so she buys a total of \(10 \times 4 = 40\) bananas.
- Each banana costs $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas is \(40 \times 0.80 = \$32.00\).

Next, calculate the total cost if Jenny bought the bananas in bunches:
- Each bunch costs $3.00, and she buys 10 bunches, so the total cost is \(10 \times 3.00 = \$30.00\).

Finally, determine the savings by subtracting the total cost of buying in bunches from the total cost of buying individually:
- Savings = $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount of fence left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine Marcel's earnings from selling bicycles, we need to break down the sales and calculate the total revenue step by step.

First, we calculate the number of each type of bike sold:
- **Trekking bikes:** Half of the total bikes sold are Trekking bikes.
  \[
  \text{Number of Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
  \]
- **BMX bikes:** 15% of the total bikes sold are BMX bikes.
  \[
  \text{Number of BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
  \]
- **MTB bikes:** The rest of the bikes sold are MTB bikes.
  \[
  \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105
  \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- **Trekking bikes:** Each Trekking bike is sold for $450.
  \[
  \text{Total earnings from Trekking bikes} = 150 \times 450 = 67500
  \]
- **BMX bikes:** Each BMX bike is sold for half the price of an MTB bike, which is $250.
  \[
  \text{Total earnings from BMX bikes} = 45 \times 250 = 11250
  \]
- **MTB bikes:** Each MTB bike is sold for $500.
  \[
  \text{Total earnings from MTB bikes} = 105 \times 500 = 52500
  \]

Finally, we sum the total earnings from all types of bikes:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250
\]

Thus, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine the number of bales of hay left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the net effect of the farmer's and the truck's activities over that period.

1. **Calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:**
   - The farmer makes 5 bales per hour.
   - Over 6 hours, the farmer makes \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) bales.

2. **Calculate the number of bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours:**

"To determine the height the ball reaches on its second bounce, we start by calculating the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Given that each story is 24 feet high and the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

The ball bounces back to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its previous height. Therefore, after the first bounce, the height is:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

For the second bounce, the ball again bounces back to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. Thus, the height after the second bounce is:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

"To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, let's denote the initial amount of meat as \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, leaving \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. A pack of velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which means they left \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The lazy Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms of meat, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \) by multiplying both sides by 4:

\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1080}

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is \(\boxed{144}\) dollars."
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we can follow a step-by-step analysis of the events:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 of them.
   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - This leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken.

2. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.

3. **Ellen's Friend's Turn:**
   - Ellen's friend now has to choose 1 soda from the remaining 4 sodas (2 shaken and 2 unshaken).

We need to calculate the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The total number of sodas left is 4.
   - The number of shaken sodas left is 2.
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

5. **Expressing the Probability as a Percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100.

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. **Speed of the first train:**
   - The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.

2. **Speed of the second train:**
   - The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train.
   - Therefore, the speed of the second train is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

3. **Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - For the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:**
   - For the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Total distance = Distance traveled by the first train + Distance traveled by the second train
   - Total distance = \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is 270 miles."

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).

Additionally, a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \) jellyfish change color.

We are told that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

The correct answer is \( \boxed{90} \)."

\text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary in retirement, which amounts to:

\[
\text{Annual living expenses in retirement} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
\]

Since she plans to save for 20 years, the total amount she needs to save for retirement is:

\[
\text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
\]

To find out how many years she needs to work to save \$800,000, we divide the total retirement savings needed by her annual savings:

\[
\text{Number of years needed} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
\]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"To determine the length of each final cut, we can follow these steps:

1. **Cut the ribbon into 4 equal parts:**
   Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. To find the length of each of the 4 equal parts, we divide 100 cm by 4.
   \[
   \text{Length of each part} = \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
   \]

2. **Divide each of the 4 parts into 5 equal parts:**
   Each of the 4 parts is 25 cm long. To find the length of each of the 5 equal parts, we divide 25 cm by 5.
   \[
   \text{Length of each final part} = \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]

Thus, the length of each final cut will be:
\[
\boxed{5 \text{ cm}}
\]"
"To determine the total number of students in the school, we start with the information that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys. Let \( N \) represent the total number of students in the school. We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To solve for \( N \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Performing the division:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} = \frac{240 \times 100}{40} = \frac{24000}{40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, to find the number of girls, we note that 60% of the students are girls (since 100% - 40% = 60%). Therefore, the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"

"To find the average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party, we need to calculate the mean of the heel heights.

Given:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels.

First, we calculate the total height of the heels:
- Total height from the 4-inch heels: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Total height from the 2-inch heels: \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Next, we find the combined total height of all the heels:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

There are a total of \(3 + 3 = 6\) women at the party.

To find the average height of the heels, we divide the total height by the number of women:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"

1. **Calculate the total number of days in June:** June has 30 days.

2. **Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June:** She plans to hike 9,300 miles.

3. **Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day:** She plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total miles per day she plans to hike is:
   \[
   125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

4. **Determine the required miles per day to complete the journey in 30 days:** To complete her journey in 30 days, she needs to hike:
   \[
   \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

5. **Calculate the difference between the required miles per day and the planned miles per day:** The difference is:
   \[
   310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day}

"To determine how many kilograms of apples James will have left, we first need to calculate the amount of apples each person wants.

Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[
\text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Paul wants one-third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Adding the amounts that Pierre and Paul want:
\[
\text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

The total amount of apples bought by Pierre, Paul, and Jacques is 12 kg. Therefore, the amount of apples left for James is:
\[
\text{Apples left for James} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine the cost of each book, we start by calculating the total amount of money Anna has spent on books. Initially, she had a budget of $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. Therefore, the amount spent on books is:

\[
16 - 2 = 14
\]

Since she bought 2 books and both cost the same amount, we divide the total amount spent on books by 2:

\[
\frac{14}{2} = 7
\]

Thus, the cost of each book is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"To determine the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we start with the number of students from last year, which is 50. A 20% increase in enrollment means we need to calculate 20% of 50 and then add this to the original number.

First, we calculate 20% of 50:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

Next, we add this increase to the original number of students:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 60.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To determine how long it will take the lighthouse light to blink 459 times, we start by finding the rate of blinking. Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the number of blinks per minute as follows:

\[
\text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can use the blinks per minute to determine the time required:

\[
\text{Time in minutes} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}

"To determine the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we will calculate the time each person spent on their respective tasks and then sum these times.

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Mowing the lawn took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Walking the dog took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \(4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Doing laundry took her more than 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time is more than \(4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}\).
   - Let's assume Dior took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption given the problem's phrasing).

Now, we sum up the total time taken by all three:

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours} = 22 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{22}\) hours."
"To determine the total miles John drives each month when visiting his parents, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

   John takes 2 hours to drive one way.

2. **Determine the speed:**
   John drives at a speed of 70 mph.

3. **Calculate the distance for one way:**
   Using the formula for distance, \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \):
   \[
   \text{Distance one way} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the round trip distance:**
   Since John visits his parents twice a month, the round trip distance is:

"To determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days, we start by noting that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. Therefore, in 7 days, she will walk:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

The problem states that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Let \( B \) represent the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days. We can set up the equation:

\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine the number of toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers:
   - Two workers produce 6 toys per hour, so together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
   - Another two workers produce 4 toys per hour, so together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
   - Therefore, the total production rate of the first four workers is \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.
   - Over a 10-hour shift, the first four workers produce \(20 \times 10 = 200\) toys.

2. The total order is 400 toys, and by the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs 20 toys to ship the order. This means the number of toys produced by the first four workers is \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys.

3. Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in the same 10-hour period.

4. To find the production rate of the fifth worker, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
   \[
   \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
   \]

Therefore, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we start by calculating the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the given information.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weights of Elijah's dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight of both dogs} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"To determine the number of stickers Seth originally had, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. If Seth originally had \( S \) stickers, then Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total. Therefore, \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 16 \times 4 = 64 \).

\[ 90 \]"
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we start by calculating half of the Earth's circumference. The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of this distance is:

\[
\frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:

\[
\frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth is 50 days. The correct answer is:

"To determine the speed of the fastest car, we start by identifying the speed of the 2nd fastest car. Given that the average car can go 120 miles per hour and the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, we calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, we calculate the speed of the fastest car by multiplying the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25:

\[ \text{Speed of the fastest car} = 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Liam's age two years ago:**
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.
   - Two years ago, Liam's age was \(16 - 2 = 14\) years old.

2. **Set up the relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages:**
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince.
   - Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago.

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   - Two years ago, Liam's age was 14, and this was twice Vince's age.
   - Therefore, \(14 = 2V\).

4. **Solve for Vince's age two years ago:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]
   - So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago.

5. **Determine Vince's current age:**
   - Since two years have passed since then, Vince's current age is:
     \[
     7 + 2 = 9
     \]

Thus, Vince is currently 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"Given the problem, we can set up the equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline as \( A \). Since they painted the same number of eggs, we have:
\[ A = A \]

Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Sarah as \( S \). Then, the number of eggs painted by Camden is \( S + 12 \) because Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

We are given that the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We are also given that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 9 \) back into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ A = 13 \]

So, Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we start by calculating the number of groups of 8 crayons that can be made from 200 crayons:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{200 \text{ crayons}}{8 \text{ crayons/group}} = 25 \text{ groups} \]

Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in one box, so we have 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, and each crayon weighs 1 ounce. Therefore, the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ \text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

The total weight of the boxes is:

\[ \text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

To convert the total weight from ounces to pounds, we use the conversion factor that 16 ounces equal 1 pound:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To determine how much John makes, we need to follow the steps methodically:

1. **Calculate the length of the logs:**
   John can make logs from 80% of the 80-foot tree.
   \[
   \text{Length of logs} = 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of 4-foot logs:**
   Each log is 4 feet long.
   \[
   \text{Number of logs} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of planks:**
   John cuts 5 planks from each log.
   \[
   \text{Number of planks} = 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   Each plank is sold for $1.2.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount John makes is \(\boxed{96}\) dollars."
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we can break down the problem step by step.

First, we know Valerie earns $5000 per month. This amount is half of what her brother earns. Therefore, we can calculate her brother's salary as follows:
\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 2 \times \text{Valerie's salary} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

Next, we find their combined salary:
\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:
\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times \text{Combined salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, we sum up the salaries of Valerie, her brother, and their mother to find the total amount of money they have together:
\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 45000 \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time Grandma spends walking on both the beach and the sidewalk.

First, we know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which is 2 miles long. Her speed on the beach can be calculated as:
\[ v_{\text{beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ v_{\text{sidewalk}} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

The time spent walking on the sidewalk, which is 1 mile long, is:
\[ \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on both segments gives the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

\[
\text{Number of weeks needed} = \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks}
\]

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60. The final numerical answer is:

- Three trees each had 7 blue birds, so that's \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds.
- Two trees each had 4 blue birds, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds.
- One tree had 3 blue birds.

Adding these together, we get:
\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To determine the initial number of marbles Bob has, we start with the information that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. If Bob loses 10 of these marbles, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, we start by setting up the equation based on the given conditions. Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water: one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature \( T \). After pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the average temperature of the water in the bottle must be at least 40 degrees.

The total volume of water in the bottle is 5 ounces, with 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug. The average temperature of the water in the bottle is given by:

\[
\frac{4 \times 33 + 1 \times (T - 1)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the left side of the inequality:

\[
\frac{132 + T - 1}{5} \geq 40
\]

\[
\frac{131 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:

\[
131 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 131 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 69
\]

Therefore, the second mug must be at least 69 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{69}
\]"
"To determine the total number of animals on Melanie's farm after three weeks, we need to account for the initial number of animals and the additions over the period.

Initially, the farm has:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ chickens} = 70 \text{ animals} \]

Over three weeks, which is 21 days, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. Therefore, the number of cows added is:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

And the number of chickens added is:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Adding these to the initial number of animals gives:
\[ 70 \text{ initial animals} + 420 \text{ cows added} + 210 \text{ chickens added} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 700 \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"To determine the cost per bagel after the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the total cost is:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to this total cost. The discount amount is:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the final cost:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets with the 4 packs. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is:

\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per single bagel is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine how many potatoes Gomer ate, we start by calculating the number of scoops he consumed. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be calculated as:

\[ 23 - 5 = 18 \]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We calculate 1 less than 3 as follows:

\[ 3 - 1 = 2 \]

This means that 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require a certain number of potatoes. According to the problem, it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. We calculate 3 less than 6 as:

\[ 6 - 3 = 3 \]

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion based on the given information:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we can break the problem into two segments: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

1. **First 30 days:**
   Chester eats 3 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs in the first 30 days} = 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

2. **Next 30 days:**
   Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs in the next 30 days} = 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

3. **Total eggs over 60 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total eggs} = 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert total eggs to dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs,
   \[
   \text{Total dozens of eggs} = \frac{240 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20 \, \text{dozen}
   \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"To determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of green jellybeans, which is given as 17.
2. Calculate the number of red jellybeans, which is twice the number of green jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is \(2 \times 17 = 34\).
3. The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60. To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans. Thus, the number of blue jellybeans is \(60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9\).

Therefore, the number of blue jellybeans is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we can break down the problem into simpler steps.

1. **Calculate the number of lemons collected from one tree in one year:**
   \[
   \text{Lemons per tree per year} = 6
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of lemons collected from all trees in one year:**
   \[
   \text{Total lemons per year} = \text{Number of trees} \times \text{Lemons per tree per year}
   \]
   Given that Tim grows 5 trees:
   \[
   \text{Total lemons per year} = 5 \times 6 = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of lemons collected in a decade:**
   A decade is 10 years. Therefore, we multiply the total lemons collected in one year by 10:
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = \text{Total lemons per year} \times 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = 30 \times 10 = 300
   \]

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio and total number of passengers. The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14 parts. Since the total number of passengers is 84, each part of the ratio corresponds to 84 / 14 = 6 passengers.

Next, we calculate the number of men and women:
- The number of men is 5 parts, so the number of men is 5 * 6 = 30.
- The number of women is 9 parts, so the number of women is 9 * 6 = 54.

After the next stop, 20 women alight from the bus. Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is:
- Initial number of women: 54
- Women alighting: 20
- Women remaining: 54 - 20 = 34

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we need to break down the sales and calculations step by step.

First, let's find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold per day. We know that he earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets of sunflowers, with each bouquet containing 12 sunflowers.

1. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Number of bouquets sold per day = \(\frac{56}{8} = 7\) bouquets.

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - Number of sunflowers in 7 bouquets = \(7 \times 12 = 84\) sunflowers.

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers.
   - Number of sunflowers sold per day = \(\frac{26}{2} = 13\) sunflowers.
   - Total sunflowers sold per day = Sunflowers from sunflowers + Sunflowers from bouquets = \(13 + 84 = 97\) sunflowers.

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - Total sunflowers sold after 3 days = \(97 \times 3 = 291\).

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is \(\boxed{291}\)."
"To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with $100:**
   Each rock costs $5, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
   \]

2. **Determine how many rocks Adam sells:**
   He sells 60% of his inventory:
   \[
   \text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12
   \]

3. **Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks:**
   Each rock is sold for $7, so:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = 12 \times 7 = 84
   \]

4. **Calculate the money left after selling the rocks:**
   Adam initially invested $100, and he sells 12 rocks for $84, so:
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 100 - (20 \times 5) + 84 = 100 - 100 + 84 = 84
   \]

5. **Determine the amount of money Adam loses:**
   Adam's initial investment was $100, and he ends up with $84 after selling 60% of his inventory, so:
   \[
   \text{Money lost} = 100 - 84 = 16

"To determine the probability that both tickets are winners, we start by identifying the probabilities for each ticket individually.

1. **Probability of winning the first ticket:**
   The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   P(\text{Winning first ticket}) = 0.20
   \]

2. **Probability of winning the second ticket:**
   The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is:
   \[
   P(\text{Winning second ticket}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
   \]

3. **Probability that both tickets are winners:**
   Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
   \[
   P(\text{Both tickets are winners}) = P(\text{Winning first ticket}) \times P(\text{Winning second ticket})
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   P(\text{Both tickets are winners}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. **Expressing the probability as a percentage:**
   To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. Therefore, we can express the number of seashells Carlos collected as:
\[ C = J - 5 \]
Given \( J = 27 \), we substitute to find \( C \):
\[ C = 27 - 5 = 22 \]

Next, we know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. So, we can express the number of seashells Carrey collected as:
\[ C = 2R \]
Given \( C = 22 \), we substitute to find \( R \):
\[ 22 = 2R \]
\[ R = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

Now, we have the number of seashells collected by each person:
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

The total number of seashells collected is:
\[ 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \]

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person received:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Therefore, each person got 20 seashells. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we can break down his consumption by day and then sum it up.

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday.
   - There are 5 weekdays in a week.
   - Total carrots eaten on weekdays = \( 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \).

2. **Weekend (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday.
   - There are 2 days in the weekend.
   - Total carrots eaten on the weekend = \( 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \).

3. **Total Carrots Eaten in a Week:**
   - Total carrots = Carrots eaten on weekdays + Carrots eaten on the weekend
   - Total carrots = \( 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \).

Therefore, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 30.

"To determine the total time of the cassette, we start by calculating the duration of the second song. Given that the first song is 5 minutes long and the second song is 60% longer than the first song, we first find 60% of 5 minutes:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding this to the original 5 minutes gives us the duration of the second song:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:

\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes. The correct answer is:

"To determine Linus's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.
2. Determine the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.
4. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the selling price of one mobile device.**

Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price.
\[ \text{Selling price} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought.**

Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday.
\[ \text{Total cost} = (2 \times 20) + (4 \times 20) = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices.**

The total number of devices sold is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]
\[ \text{Total revenue} = 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the profit.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 120 \]"
"Given the information provided, we can deduce the heights step by step. Isabel is 7 feet tall. Since Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel, we calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so we find Carl's height:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

The problem states that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle of juice.
   - Therefore, 100% of a person's daily energy demand is covered by 5 bottles of juice (since \(100\% / 20\% = 5\)).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - Each person needs 5 bottles.
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more bottles are needed:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - The number of additional bottles needed is:
     \[
     11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
     \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

First, let's determine the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:
- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
\[ 1 + 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. This can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \).

"To determine the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we start with the total number of reports received last week, which is 5168. We then subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday.

The number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907, and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136. Therefore, the calculation for the number of reports received on Wednesday is:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]
\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]
\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

Thus, the number of tax reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine the total revenue Abraham earned from selling his land, we can break down the sales step by step.

1. **First Sale:**
   Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50.
   \[
   \text{Area sold in the first sale} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   The price per square meter for the first sale is:
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

2. **Second Sale:**
   Abraham sold another 1/4 of his land for $30.
   \[
   \text{Area sold in the second sale} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   The price per square meter for the second sale is:
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

3. **Remaining Land:**
   After the first and second sales, the remaining land is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining area} = 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   Abraham sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from remaining land} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Face masks per outing**: Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out, so for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.
2. **Face masks per day**: Tyrion goes out three times a day. Therefore, the number of face masks he uses in one day is:
   \[
   3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ face masks/outing} = 6 \text{ face masks/day}
   \]
3. **Face masks in 2 days**: To find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in one day by 2:
   \[
   6 \text{ face masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ face masks}
   \]

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which totals to 36 eggs. Lamar found 5 eggs, Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, which is 10 eggs, Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, which is 8 eggs, and Mei found half as many as Charlie, which is 4 eggs. Adding up the eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei gives us a total of 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs. Subtracting the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden by Cole, we get 36 - 27 = 9 eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine John's weekly earnings, we first need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from each week. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so together they have:

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex has 60% more apartments than the combined total of the first two complexes. Therefore, the number of apartments in the third complex is:

\[ 400 + (0.60 \times 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

Adding the apartments from all three complexes, we get:

\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

Since John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex, the total number of collections he makes in a week is:

\[ 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

Given that he earns $0.40 per collection, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced each year and then sum them up.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{1850}\)."
"To determine how much money Jack has now, we start by calculating how much Sophia gave him. Since Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, we perform the calculation as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

This means Sophia gave Jack $20. Adding this amount to the $100 Jack originally had, we get:

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

Therefore, the final amount of money Jack has now is:

\[
\boxed{120}

"To solve the problem, let's denote the length of the blue rope as \( B \) centimeters, the length of the red rope as \( R \) centimeters, and the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. We are given the following relationships:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation. From the second relationship, we can express \( B \) as \( B = Y - 7 \). Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Now, substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( 5B + Y = 37 \):
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now that we have \( Y = 12 \), we can find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Given the problem, we start by defining the initial amounts of money given to Ronnie and Rissa. Ronnie received $5, and Rissa received three times that amount, which is $15.

After each of them gave an equal amount of money, say \( x \), to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money. This can be expressed as:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 15 - 12 = 3 \]

This means each of them gave $3 to their little sister. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Given the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total, and it is divided such that half is yellow (6 pints), we are left with 6 pints to be distributed among red, white, and purple paint. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, we can denote the amount of each of these paints as \( R \). Therefore, we have:

\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{2}\)"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

1. **Calculate the area of one bedroom:**
   \[
   \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total area of the 4 bedrooms:**
   \[
   \text{Total area of 4 bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the living room:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times \text{Area of one bedroom} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total area of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of 4 bedrooms} + \text{Area of the living room} + \text{Remaining area}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet}
   \]

The total area of the house is \(3160\) square feet. 

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{3160}\)."
"To determine the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday, we can follow a step-by-step calculation:

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Monday, which is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs.
3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) puffs.
4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, which is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) puffs.
5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, which is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) puffs.

Now, we sum the puffs of clouds counted each day:

\[
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 12 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 24 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 48 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:

\[
\boxed{93}

"To determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the new box:**
   - The original box contains 100 pods.
   - The new box has 20% more pods than the original box.
   - Calculate 20% of 100 pods: \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Add this to the original number of pods: \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod:**
   - The new box costs $12 for 120 pods.
   - Cost per pod: \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate the number of cycles that can be run for $1:**
   - Each cycle uses 1 pod.
   - Cost per cycle: $0.10.
   - Number of cycles for $1: \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) cycles.

Thus, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is 10.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in $20 bills, which amounts to 50 bills. After losing 10 bills, he has 40 bills left. He then uses half of these remaining bills to pay for a bill, leaving him with 20 bills. Tripling his money from $400 to $1200, he then converts this amount into $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:

\[
\frac{1200}{5} = 240
\]

Thus, Thomas has 240 $5 bills. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{240}

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we can break down the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals Scored:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To solve this problem, we need to track the chalk usage and recycling process over several days. Let's start with the initial conditions and proceed step by step.

1. **Initial Condition**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday.

2. **Chalk Usage on Monday**: The teacher uses 45% of the chalk, which is:
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Therefore, the chalk remaining after Monday is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Daily Usage**: The teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day. Let's calculate the chalk remaining each day until it is recycled.

   - **Tuesday**: 
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
     \]

   - **Wednesday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 2.20 = 0.44 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
     \]

   - **Thursday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 1.76 = 0.352 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 1.76 - 0.352 = 1.408 \text{ inches}
     \]

   - **Friday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 1.408 = 0.2816 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 1.408 - 0.2816 = 1.1264 \text{ inches}
     \]

   - **Saturday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 1.1264 = 0.22528 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 1.1264 - 0.22528 = 0.90112 \text{ inches}
     \]

   - **Sunday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.90112 = 0.180224 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.90112 - 0.180224 = 0.720896 \text{ inches}
     \]

Since the chalk remaining on Sunday is 0.720896 inches, it is not recycled yet. We need to continue this process until the chalk is less than 2 inches.

- **Monday of Next Week**:
  \[
  \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.720896 = 0.1441792 \text{ inches}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.720896 - 0.1441792 = 0.5767168 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Tuesday of Next Week**:
  \[
  \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.5767168 = 0.11534336 \text{ inches}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.5767168 - 0.11534336 = 0.46137344 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Wednesday of Next Week**:
  \[
  \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.46137344 = 0.092274688 \text{ inches}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.46137344 - 0.092274688 = 0.369098752 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Thursday of Next Week**:
  \[
  \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.369098752 = 0.0738197504 \text{ inches}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.369098752 - 0.0738197504 = 0.2952790016 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Friday of Next Week**:
  \[
  \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.2952790016 = 0.05905580032 \text{ inches}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.2952790016 - 0.05905580032 = 0.23622320128 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Saturday of Next Week**:
  \[
  \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.23622320128 = 0.047244640256 \text{ inches}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.23622320128 - 0.047244640256 = 0.188978561024 \text{ inches}
  \]

- **Sunday of Next Week**:
  \[
  \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.188978561024 = 0.0377957122048 \text{ inches}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.188978561024 - 0.0377957122048 = 0.1511828488192 \text{ inches}
  \]

Since the chalk remaining on Sunday of the next week is 0.1511828488192 inches, which is still greater than 2 inches, the teacher will continue to use the chalk until it is recycled.

To determine the number of days until the chalk is recycled, we need to count the days from Monday to Sunday of the next week, which is 7 days.

Therefore, the teacher has 7 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}

"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we start by calculating the number of girls and boys who are on varsity.

- Number of girls in the class: 12
- Number of boys in the class: 12

One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate the number of girls and boys not on varsity.

- Number of girls not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

- Number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

Finally, we find the total number of students not on varsity by adding the number of girls and boys not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

Thus, the number of students not on varsity is \(\boxed{17}\)."

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of teeth drilled and capped:**
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

2. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   - The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

3. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   - The percentage of teeth fixed is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
     \]

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \(50\%\).

The correct answer is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To determine the refund amount Mr. Marcellus received, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased:**
   The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost is:
   \[
   4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date:**
   Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk he purchased. The amount of milk returned is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the refund amount:**
   The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned. Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the refund amount is:
   \[
   1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the amount Mr. Marcellus received in refunds is:
\[

"To solve the problem, let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write the equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

First, we'll solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
\[ W = 5(20 + 7) \]
\[ W = 5 \times 27 \]
\[ W = 135 \]

2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)
\[ 20 + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( 20 \).

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we start by calculating the total number of books he can purchase with $27,000. Given that he can buy 100 books for $500, we first find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27,000:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means he can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Therefore, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Next, we need to distribute these 5400 books equally among the 3 schools:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

Thus, each school can receive 1800 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"
"Let's recount the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial apples**: Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 2

2. **First interaction**:
   - Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 1 (remaining apple)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1 (pocketed apple) + 1 (thrown apple) = 2

3. **Second interaction**:
   - Newton picked up the remaining apple, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 0 (all apples thrown)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 2 (pocketed apples) + 1 (thrown apple) = 3

4. **Third interaction**:
   - Newton picked up all the remaining apples (6 more apples fell out of the tree).
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 3 (pocketed apples) + 6 (picked up apples) = 9

Therefore, Newton brought home 9 apples.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost of the coal Ali ordered, we start by calculating the number of 50 kg bags in 850 kg of coal. This is done by dividing the total weight of coal by the weight of each bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is \(\boxed{306}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of slices consumed by her 6 friends. Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.

For the cheese pizza:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]
Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

For the pepperoni pizza:
\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]
Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, which totals to:
\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we can break down the days and their respective distances:

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. Therefore, the total for these three days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}
  \]

- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. Therefore, the total for these two days is:
  \[
  5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}
  \]

Adding the miles from both sets of days gives us the total miles Sam ran this week:
\[
9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for his production rate and the rate at which the snowballs melt.

1. **Rate of Snowball Production:**
   Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Rate of Snowball Melt:**
   In 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. Therefore, in one hour (60 minutes), the number of 15-minute intervals is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 4 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   Consequently, the number of snowballs that melt in one hour is:
   \[
   2 \text{ snowballs/interval} \times 4 \text{ intervals} = 8 \text{ snowballs}
   \]

3. **Net Snowball Production per Hour:**
   The net number of snowballs Jay produces in one hour is:
   \[
   20 \text{ snowballs} - 8 \text{ snowballs} = 12 \text{ snowballs}
   \]

4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs:**
   To find out how many hours it takes to produce 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net production rate:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."
"Given that John is currently 28 years old and he was twice as old as Jim when the show came out, we can deduce Jim's age at that time. If John's age at that time was \(2J\), and we know John's current age is 28, we can set up the equation:

\[2J = 28\]

Solving for \(J\):

\[J = \frac{28}{2} = 14\]

Thus, Jim was 14 years old when the show came out. Since no additional time has passed, Jim is still 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

14"
"To determine the total number of slices of apple eaten by Doxa, her sister, and her brother, we can follow these steps:

1. Doxa ate 1 slice.
2. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
3. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices eaten is:
\[1 + 2 + 3 = 6\]

Therefore, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is 6."
"To determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, let's trace the bandage usage and orders step by step.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 + 100 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used \(81 - 78 = 3\) bandages more than they needed to reach 78 bandages.

Since they had 81 bandages after ordering and using 25, and they ended up with 78, it means they used 3 more bandages than necessary. This confirms the calculations.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{62}
\]"
"To determine the total cost for May's haircut and color, we need to break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the length of hair cut:**
   - Initial hair length: 10 inches

2. **Calculate the cost of the haircut:**
   - Cost per inch of haircut: $30
   - Total cost for the haircut: \(2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars/inch} = 60 \text{ dollars}\)

3. **Add the cost of the hair color:**
   - Cost of the hair color: $40
   - Total cost for the haircut and color: \(60 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, the total cost for May's haircut and color is \(\boxed{100}\) dollars."
"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her earnings from her hourly wage and her additional attendance bonus.

First, let's calculate her daily earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Daily earnings = 7.5 hours/day * $1.5/hour = $11.25/day

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
- Jen works 6 days a week.

Weekly earnings = $11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.50/week

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, we calculate her total earnings for the month:
- Total earnings for April = $67.50/week * 4 weeks = $270.00

Additionally, Jen receives an extra $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she did not incur any absences for April, she will receive this bonus for 4 weeks:
- Total attendance bonus for April = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40.00

Finally, we add her total earnings for the month and her total attendance bonus:
- Total amount Jen will receive = $270.00 + $40.00 = $310.00

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{310}

"To calculate Jason's earnings, we need to sum the earnings from each task he performed over the two-week period.

1. **Earnings from doing laundry:**
   Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from laundry} = 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room:**
   Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} = 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Earnings from taking the trash out:**
   Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out each week. Since he took the trash out twice in the two-week period:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from taking the trash out} = 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:**
   Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher each time. Since he emptied the dishwasher 6 times:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher} = 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Jason earned is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

"To determine the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we start by calculating the blood volume of a single shark. Given that each whale has 40 gallons of blood and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we can calculate the blood volume of a shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, to find the total blood volume for ten sharks, we multiply the blood volume of one shark by ten:

\[ \text{Total blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we can break down the entries step by step:

1. **Morning Entry:**
   - 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.

2. **Entry at 10:00:**
   - 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00.
   - These 40 people ordered the same amount of food as the first 50 people.

3. **Additional Entry:**
   - Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in later.
   - Number of people who came in later = \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

4. **Evening Entry:**
   - An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.
   - Number of people who came in evening = \(3 \times 50 = 150\).

Now, we sum up all the entries:

- Morning entry: 50 people
- Entry at 10:00: 40 people
- Additional entry: 80 people
- Evening entry: 150 people

Total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:

\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 260 \]

Thus, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is:

\[ \boxed{260} \]"
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we start by calculating the number of red pens. Given that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of black pens were bought. The problem states that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since she bought 5 packs of red pens, the number of packs of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Adding the number of red pens and black pens together gives us the total number of pens:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the cost per bottle of scotch. Given that John buys 10 bottles for a total of $600, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost per bottle of scotch:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch, and he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

The total cost for the cognac is then:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac gives us the total amount John spends:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2400}

"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, so he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - On the second day, he planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. Since he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day, \(\frac{1}{4}\) more than 40 is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\). Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees on the second day.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - The total number of White Oak trees planted over the two days is \(20 + 30 = 50\).
   - The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days is \(40 + 50 = 90\).
   - Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(50 + 90 = 140\).

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."

"Let's solve the problem step by step. We are given the equation \(4x + 8 = 40\), where \(x\) represents the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

First, we need to isolate \(x\). We start by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
\[4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8\]
\[4x = 32\]

Next, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(x\):
\[\frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4}\]
\[x = 8\]

Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \(8\).

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes, and then find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes.

1. **Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:**
   - There are 66 fish in total.
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes:**
   - Total number of fish = 66
   - Number of fish with red stripes = 22
   \[
   \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:**
   - Number of fish with red stripes = 22
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = 20
   \[
   \text{Total number of fish with red or blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
   \]

Thus, the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"To determine the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we can break down the problem step by step.

Initially, Amy has two eyeshadow palettes, each with four colors, and three makeup sets, each with six colors. Therefore, the total number of eyeshadow colors is calculated as follows:

\[2 \times 4 + 3 \times 6 = 8 + 18 = 26\]

When her sister steals one of the eyeshadow palettes, which contains four colors, the number of colors left is:

\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Next, Amy uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set contains six colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:

\[\frac{6}{2} = 3\]

Therefore, after using half of the colors from one makeup set, the number of colors left is:

\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Thus, the final number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:

\[\boxed{19}\]"
"Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, the total height of the house is:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is, so the height of the first floor is:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, the height of the second floor is:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is:

"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. The cost price of the magazines is $72.

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99
   \]

   So, the selling price is $99.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
   \]

   Substitute the values:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27

"To determine the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed per day for each setting and then sum these amounts over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the low setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day on the medium setting as on the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the medium setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day on the high setting as on the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the high setting for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \).

Now, we sum the total water removed over all settings:
\[
3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."

   - Therefore, the second medicine amount is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.

2. **Total amount of medicine in one dose:**
   - The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicine amounts.
   - Therefore, the total amount is \(14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL}\).

3. **Total amount of medicine in 8 doses:**
   - The total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 8 times the amount in one dose.
   - Therefore, the total amount is \(8 \times 56 = 448 \text{ mL}\).

"To determine the combined capacity of both schools, we start by identifying the capacity of Ali's class, which is given as 120 students.

Next, we calculate the capacity of each of John's classes. Since each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class, we find:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

John has two such classes, so the total capacity of John's classes is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Adding the capacities of Ali's class and John's classes gives us the combined capacity of both schools:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

\[
\boxed{150}

"To determine how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Stephen will return to his sister.
2. Determine the total amount Stephen will pay over the first 11 months.
3. Subtract the amount paid over the first 11 months from the total amount to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Stephen will return.**

Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. The interest amount is:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]
So, the total amount Stephen will return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount Stephen will pay over the first 11 months.**

Stephen will pay $25 per month for the first 11 months. The total amount paid over these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.**

The amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he will return minus the amount he has already paid over the first 11 months:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, and there are 2 children. Therefore, the total number of diaper changes per day is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

2. Jordan's wife changes half of the diaper changes. So, she changes \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) diaper changes per day.

3. Consequently, Jordan changes the remaining diaper changes. Since there are 10 diaper changes in total and his wife changes 5, Jordan changes \(10 - 5 = 5\) diaper changes per day.

The final numerical answer is:
5"
"To determine how far off Tim's guess was, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar has a square base with side length 6 inches and a height of 15 inches.
   \[
   \text{Volume of the jar} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans:**
   Given the packing efficiency is 80%, the effective volume occupied by the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine the difference between the true number and the estimated number:**
   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
   \]

Thus, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{36}

"To determine the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   The initial cost of one visit is $2. Pauline visits the museum three times a year.

2. **Cost Increase Calculation:**
   After 5 years, the cost of one visit increases by 150%. The increase in cost is:
   \[
   2 \times 1.5 = 3
   \]
   Therefore, the new cost per visit after 5 years is:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5
   \]

3. **Total Visits Over 8 Years:**
   Pauline continues to visit the museum three times a year for a total of 8 years. The total number of visits is:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - For the first 5 years, the cost per visit is $2, so the total cost for these visits is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10
     \]
   - For the next 3 years, the cost per visit is $5, so the total cost for these visits is:
     \[
     5 \times 3 = 15
     \]
   - Adding these together gives the total cost over the 8 years:
     \[
     10 + 15 = 25
     \]

Therefore, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students who can try the escape room. There are 10 students in each of the 3 grades, so the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students} \]

2. Determine the number of groups needed. Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to calculate the number of groups:
\[ \text{Number of groups} = \left\lceil \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 3.75 \right\rceil = 4 \text{ groups} \]

3. Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. Therefore, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet, as it is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.

Given that the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation to represent the total length:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the amount of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning needed, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of meat required:**
   Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. Therefore, the amount of meat needed is:
   \[
   \text{Amount of meat} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed:**
   Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Therefore, for 5 pounds of meat, the amount of seasoning required is:
   \[
   \text{Amount of seasoning} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}

\[ 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Since Luke needs to buy fabric that is 2 times the total width of the windows, the amount of fabric required is:

\[ 2 \times 175 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the amount of fabric Luke should buy is 350 inches. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"To determine the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two segments based on the pricing structure provided.

First, for the initial 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. Therefore, the cost for the first 16 minutes is calculated as follows:
\[
16 \times 0.25 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, for the remaining 20 minutes, the cost drops to $0.2 per minute. Thus, the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is:
\[
20 \times 0.2 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost for the 36-minute call:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information. Let \( C \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly made, and \( B \) represent the number of brownies. According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, which can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

Additionally, the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 10, and each of the 5 people in the class gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats is:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Thus, Carly made 3 cupcakes. To verify, if \( C = 3 \), then:
\[ B = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \]

The total number of treats is:
\[ C + B = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Karen, we start by calculating the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts or additional charges:

- Cost of a basic manicure: $35
- Cost of a basic pedicure: $40

Adding these together gives the total cost for both services without any discounts:

\[
35 + 40 = 75
\]

The salon offers a 20% discount if both services are purchased together. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:

\[
0.20 \times 75 = 15
\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives the discounted total:

\[
75 - 15 = 60
\]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total, and each nail art service costs $3:

\[
10 \times 3 = 30
\]

Adding the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost of the manicure and pedicure gives the final amount Karen would pay:

\[
60 + 30 = 90
\]

Therefore, the final amount Karen would pay is:

\[
\boxed{90}

"To determine the final price of the toy after the price changes in November, December, and January, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price in December:**
   - The original price in November is $40.
   - The price increased by 80% in December.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Adding this increase to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72
     \]
   - Therefore, the price in December is $72.

2. **Calculate the price in January:**
   - The price in December is $72.
   - The price decreased by 50% in January.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72:
     \[
     0.50 \times 72 = 36
     \]
   - Subtracting this decrease from the December price:
     \[
     72 - 36 = 36

"To determine the total amount of money Charlie makes for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both his standard lessons and his lessons for veterans.

First, let's calculate the earnings from the standard lessons. Charlie has 4 lessons at a standard rate of $80 per hour:

\[
4 \text{ lessons} \times \$80 \text{ per hour} = 4 \times 80 = \$320
\]

Next, we calculate the earnings from the lessons given to veterans. The reduced rate for veteran lessons is 25% off the standard rate. Therefore, the reduced rate is:

\[
\$80 \times (1 - 0.25) = \$80 \times 0.75 = \$60 \text{ per hour}
\]

Since Charlie has 2 lessons for veterans, the total earnings from these lessons are:

\[
2 \text{ lessons} \times \$60 \text{ per hour} = 2 \times 60 = \$120
\]

Adding the earnings from both types of lessons gives us the total amount of money Charlie makes for the day:

\[
\$320 + \$120 = \$440
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is \(\boxed{440}\)."
"To find Sally's mean score, we need to calculate the average of all her quiz scores. The scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

First, we sum all the scores:
\[ 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630 \]

Next, we count the number of scores, which is 9.

The mean score is calculated by dividing the sum of the scores by the number of scores:
\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{630}{9} = 70 \]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is \(\boxed{70}\)."

"To determine how much money Walter received from selling the apples, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of apples Walter ate:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]
   So, the number of apples remaining after eating is:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. Calculate the number of apples given to his sister, which is 25% of the remaining 36 apples:
   \[
   0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister is:
   \[
   36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
   \]

3. Calculate the total amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining 27 apples at $3 each:

"Given that Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this number represents 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} x \]

To find \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ 9 \times 4 = 3x \]
\[ 36 = 3x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{36}{3} \]
\[ x = 12 \]

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we first calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days. Given his average speed is 50 km/hr, we need to find out how many hours he travels in 3 days.

There are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

At an average speed of 50 km/hr, the total distance he travels in 72 hours is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of this distance that Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

   Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Grapes used by her brother:**
   Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is:
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
   \]

3. **Grapes remaining after her brother:**
   The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is:
   \[
   6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of grapes remaining is:
   \[
   \text{Total grapes at the beginning} - 36 = \text{Remaining grapes}
   \]

4. **Grapes used to make pies:**
   Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]

5. **Total grapes at the beginning:**
   Since the remaining grapes after her brother used his share are used to make the pies, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total grapes at the beginning} - 36 = 48
   \]
   Solving for the total number of grapes at the beginning:

"To determine the percentage of their day that the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we first calculate the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total cleaning time is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total cleaning time into hours since the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their 8-hour workday is spent cleaning classrooms, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

Therefore, on average, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms. This result indicates that the custodian spends more than one full workday cleaning the classrooms in the given 5 days.

"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, let's break down the information given:

- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

The total capacity of one bookcase is the sum of the capacities of all the shelves:
\[ \text{Total capacity} = 20 + 10 + 10 + 15 = 55 \text{ books} \]

Elly has 110 books. To find out how many bookcases are needed, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \text{Number of bookcases needed} = \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Rose's profit, we first calculate the total cost of the eggs she bought. Since she bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she will sell the eggs for. Since she sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs and she has 60 eggs, the number of sets of 3 eggs is:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Given that each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total selling price is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

"To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky in cents, we start by calculating the discounted price of the bag. The original price of the bag is $18.00, and it is $3.00 off, so the discounted price is:
\[ 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \]

Next, we know that the bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky. To find the cost per stick, we divide the discounted price by the number of sticks:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

Since we need the cost per stick in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents by multiplying by 100:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky in cents is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we start by calculating the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test. The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct:

\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test. The total number of questions on both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to answer 70% of these 110 questions correctly:

\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as \( S \) and the number of blueberry cubes as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is given by the equation:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is 116. This can be written as:
\[ S + B = 116 \]

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{96} \]"

"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we will calculate the depreciation year by year starting from the initial value of $9000.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."

"To determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we start by noting the total number of marbles Mazie initially had, which is 52. After giving some marbles to Dallas and Darla, Dallas ends up with 17 marbles. This means that the total number of marbles given to both Dallas and Darla is:

\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

Let \( x \) be the number of marbles given to Darla. Since Dallas received 17 marbles, the equation representing the total number of marbles given to both is:

\[ x + 17 = 35 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 35 - 17 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is 18. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{18}\)"

"To determine how much money Frances has left after her sales and expenses, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total revenue from selling cupcakes and cookies.
2. Calculate the total cost of the trays of cookies.
3. Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the remaining money.

First, let's calculate the total revenue:
- Frances sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each, so the revenue from cupcakes is \(20 \times 2 = \$40\).
- She sells 40 cookies at $1 each, so the revenue from cookies is \(40 \times 1 = \$40\).
- Therefore, the total revenue is \(40 + 40 = \$80\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost:
- Each tray of cookies costs $4, and she buys 5 trays, so the total cost is \(5 \times 4 = \$20\).

Finally, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the remaining money:
- The remaining money is \(80 - 20 = \$60\).

Thus, the final amount of money Frances has left is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **First Street**: The truck starts with 5 children.
2. **Second Street**: Each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. **Third Street**: Each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children, so the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

By the time the truck reaches the end of the third street, there are 30 children following it. Then, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, the number of children remaining is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

Therefore, the final number of children following the truck is 25.

12 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} + 20 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 10 jars:
\[
44 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 440 \text{ dollars}
\]

Tim sells each jar for $50. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[
50 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we determine the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

   - Total holes = 84.
   - Net change per day = 3 holes.
   - Total days required = \( \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \).

4. **Convert the total number of days into weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total weeks required = \( \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \).

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To find the difference in average enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School, we start by calculating the enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls 4000 students annually, we can calculate the enrollment at Butler High School as follows:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we determine how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School by subtracting the enrollment at Butler High School from the enrollment at Norman High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1000}

"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family, we start with the total number of cookies, which is 7995. We know that 2595 of these are rainbow cookies and 3075 are oatmeal cookies. The number of chocolate chip cookies can be calculated by subtracting the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

First, we add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
\[ 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies:
\[ 7995 - 5670 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2325 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step with a clearer focus on the calculations.

1. **Determine the number of test tubes Igor gathered:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes.

   - Total gathered: \( 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \)

5. **Determine the number of items Igor lost:**
   - Total items requested: 16 test tubes + 7 beakers + 14 Petri dishes = 37 items.
   - Total items Igor gathered: 31 items.
   - Therefore, the number of items Igor lost is \( 37 - 31 = 6 \).

6. **Determine the number of beakers Igor lost:**
   - Since Igor gathered 7 beakers and lost a total of 6 items, he must have lost 1 beaker.

Thus, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we start by calculating the total number of screws required for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:

\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:

\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we start by noting the number of eggs in the first basket, which is 10. The second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, so we calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20
\]

Next, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total:

\[
10 + 20 = 30
\]

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{30}

"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we need to sum the individual contributions:

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total:

\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is \(\boxed{2180}\) dollars."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. If we let Vanessa's speed be \( V \) miles per minute, then Aaron's speed is \( 2V \) miles per minute.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and ran a distance of \( 32V \) miles (since his speed is \( 2V \) and he took 16 minutes), we can confirm that the total distance they ran together is \( 32V + 4V = 36V \) miles.

Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we need to find out how long it took her to run this distance. Given that her speed is \( V \) miles per minute, the time she took to run 4 miles is:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{4}{V} \text{ minutes} \]

We know that Aaron's speed is \( 2V \) and he took 16 minutes to run \( 32V \) miles. This confirms that the total distance is consistent with the speeds and times given.

Since \( V = 2 \) miles per minute (as \( 2V = 2 \times 1 = 2 \) miles per minute for Aaron), the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles is:

\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we start by calculating the required line for the existing 200 feet of dock. Given that 3 feet of line are needed for every foot of dock, the total line required for 200 feet of dock is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the 6 feet of new line that the caretaker already has from the total required line:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy an additional 594 feet of line. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{594} \]"
"To determine the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we can follow these steps:

1. **Number of Reservations per Night**: The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
2. **Number of Reservations per Day**: Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, the number of reservations per day is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ reservations/night}}{2 \text{ nights/day}} = 3 \text{ reservations/day}
   \]
3. **Number of Reservations per Week**: Over 7 days, the total number of reservations per week is:
   \[
   3 \text{ reservations/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]
4. **Cost per Reservation**: Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. The total cost per reservation is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. **Total Revenue per Week**: The total revenue for the week is the number of reservations per week multiplied by the cost per reservation:
   \[
   21 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 315 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{315}

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we start with the cost price of $80 for 50 watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on this cost price. First, we calculate the profit amount:

\[ \text{Profit} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

Adding this profit to the cost price gives us the total selling price:

\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

To find the selling price per watermelon, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Let's break down the information step by step to find the correct age of John's youngest son in 3 years.

1. **James's Current Age**: Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, she is currently 9 years old. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is currently 18 years old.
2. **John's Current Age**: John was 19 when James was born, and since James is 18 years old now, John is \(18 + 19 = 37\) years old.
3. **Youngest Son's Current Age**: The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.
4. **Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years**: In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate the number of oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's find out the rate at which each person peels oranges:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her rate is \(\frac{1}{3}\) oranges per minute.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her rate is \(\frac{1}{4}\) oranges per minute.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in 60 minutes (one hour):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To determine the total cost Mark incurred, we need to break down the expenses step by step.

First, the cost of a new radiator is $400, but Mark gets it at an 80% discount. The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]
Thus, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator, which takes 3 hours at a rate of $50 per hour. The cost for the installation is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Adding the cost of the radiator and the installation cost gives:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let \( C \) represent the number of chickens and \( K \) represent the number of cows. We are given two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 20.
\[ C + K = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs is 70.
\[ 2C + 4K = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[ C + K = 20 \]
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

To eliminate \( C \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how many slices of pizza each person can have, we start by calculating the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to share these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, which makes a total of 4 people. Therefore, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
