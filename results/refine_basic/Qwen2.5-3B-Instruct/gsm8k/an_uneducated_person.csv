"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Janet's ducks make 16 eggs every day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so that leaves her with 13 eggs. Then she uses 4 eggs to make muffins, so that leaves her with 9 eggs. She sells each of these 9 eggs for $2. So, she makes 9 times 2, which is 18 dollars every day at the market. So, the answer is 18 dollars."
"To figure out how many bolts of fiber are needed for the robe, we start by looking at the blue fiber. The robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber.

Next, we look at the white fiber. The problem tells us that the robe needs half as much white fiber as blue fiber. So, we calculate half of 2 bolts:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt} \]

Now, we add the bolts of blue and white fiber together to find the total:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the robe needs a total of 3 bolts of fiber. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Josh bought a house for $80,000 and then spent $50,000 on fixing it up. So, the total cost was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

Then, the house's value went up by 150%. To find out how much that is, we take 150% of $130,000, which is 1.5 times $130,000. So, 1.5 * $130,000 = $195,000.

Now, we add that to the original cost to find out the new value of the house: $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000.

To find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract the original cost from the new value: $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000.

So, Josh made a profit of $195,000."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James runs 3 sprints each time. Each sprint is 60 meters. So, if he runs 3 sprints, that's 60 meters x 3 = 180 meters in one time he runs. He does this 3 times a week. So, in a week, he runs 180 meters x 3 = 540 meters.

So, the total meters James runs in a week is 540 meters. The answer is 540 meters."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Wendi has 20 chickens, and she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed every day. So, for all the chickens, she needs 3 cups × 20 chickens = 60 cups of feed for the whole day.

In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. So, that's 15 + 25 = 40 cups for the morning and afternoon.

Now, to find out how much she needs for the last meal, we take the total feed for the day and subtract what she's already given. So, 60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups.

So, Wendi needs to give 20 cups of feed to her chickens in the final meal of the day. The answer is 20 cups."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The first glass costs $5. Every second glass costs only 60% of $5, which is $3.

So, for every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since he wants 16 glasses, that's 8 pairs. So, 8 pairs times $8 for each pair equals $64.

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for all 16 glasses. The answer is $64."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a little town called Seattle. It has 20 sheep. Now, imagine a bigger town called Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, Charleston has 4 times 20, which is 80 sheep. Then, there's a really big town called Toulouse. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 times 80, which is 160 sheep.

Now, to find out how many sheep there are in all three towns together, we add up the sheep from each town. So, we add 20 (from Seattle) plus 80 (from Charleston) plus 160 (from Toulouse). That makes 260 sheep in total.

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Carla was trying to download a big file that's 200 GB. She can download 2 GB every minute. First, she downloaded 40% of the file, which is 80 GB. To download 80 GB at 2 GB per minute, it took her 40 minutes.

Then, Windows made her stop to update, and that took 20 minutes. After that, she had to start over from the beginning to download the rest of the file. The rest of the file is 120 GB, and at 2 GB per minute, it takes her 60 minutes to download that.

So, the total time she spent is 40 minutes for the first part, 20 minutes for the update, and 60 minutes for the rest. That's 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.

So, the total time it took her to download the file is 120 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easier to understand.

John drives for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour. So, he covers 180 miles. Then he stops for 2 hours because he forgot something. After that, he drives for half an hour at 30 miles per hour, covering 15 miles. Finally, he drives for 1.5 hours at 80 miles per hour, covering 120 miles.

Now, we add up all the miles he drove:
180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles.

So, at the end of those 4 hours, John is 315 miles from home."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Eliza gets paid $10 for every hour she works. She worked 40 hours at this rate, so she earned $400 from those hours. She also worked 5 extra hours because she worked 45 hours in total. For those extra hours, she gets paid $12 an hour because it's overtime. So, for the 5 overtime hours, she earned $60. If we add the $400 from her regular hours to the $60 from her overtime hours, she earned a total of $460 this week. So, the answer is $460."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We start with 60 downloads in the first month. In the second month, the downloads tripled, so that's 3 times 60, which is 180 downloads. But then in the third month, the downloads went down by 30%, which means they lost 30 out of every 100 downloads. So, 30% of 180 is 54 downloads. That means the downloads in the third month are 180 minus 54, which is 126 downloads. To find the total, we add up all the downloads: 60 from the first month, 180 from the second month, and 126 from the third month. That gives us 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads in total. So, the answer is 366 downloads over the three months."
"Okay, let me break it down for you in a simpler way.

Toula bought donuts, mini cupcakes, and mini cheesecakes. Here's how much she spent on each:

- Donuts: She bought 3 dozen, and each dozen costs $68. So, \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.
- Mini cupcakes: She bought 2 dozen, and each dozen costs $80. So, \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.
- Mini cheesecakes: She bought 6 dozen, and each dozen costs $55. So, \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, to find the total cost, we add up all these amounts:
\[204 + 160 + 330 = 694\]

So, the total cost is $694."
"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to look at the costs and the money he makes each year.

First, the tree costs $90 to plant. Then, every year, the tree gives him 7 lemons, and he can sell each lemon for $1.5. So, the money he makes from selling lemons each year is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \]

But he also has to spend $3 a year to water and feed the tree. So, the money he makes after spending on the tree each year is:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for him to make back the $90 he spent to plant the tree. We do this by dividing the cost by the money he makes each year:
\[ \frac{\$90}{\$7.5 \text{ per year}} = 12 \text{ years} \]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree. The answer is 12 years."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Melanie sells some vacuum cleaners and ends up with 5 left. Here's how it goes:

1. She sells a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, if she started with \( x \) cleaners, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) and had \( \frac{2x}{3} \) left.
2. Then she sells 2 more at the red house, so she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) left.
3. At the orange house, she sells half of what's left, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). After this, she has 5 left.

We can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Solving this, we get:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The answer is 18."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have 20 students in total. First, 20% of them, which is 4 students, are doing contemporary dance. So, we have 20 - 4 = 16 students left.

Then, 25% of the remaining 16 students are doing jazz dance. That's 0.25 times 16, which is 4 students. So, after jazz dance, we have 16 - 4 = 12 students left.

The rest of the students, which is 12, are doing hip-hop dance. To find out what percentage 12 is of the total 20 students, we do 12 divided by 20, which is 0.6. To make it a percentage, we multiply by 100, so it's 60%.

So, 60% of the students are doing hip-hop dance. The answer is 60%."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The merchant has two choices: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. The jewelry market is expected to go up by 2.5%, and the electronic gadgets market is expected to go up by 1.2%.

If the jewelry goes up by 2.5%, it will be worth $5,125. If the electronic gadgets go up by 1.2%, they will be worth $8,096.

Now, to find out which one makes more money, we subtract the original price from the new price:
- Jewelry: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125
- Electronic gadgets: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

So, the jewelry makes more money. The profit from the jewelry is $125.

The answer is: Jewelry"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine you have two trains. They both start from the same place, San Rafael. First, they go west for 80 miles. Then, the next day, they go north for 150 miles. We want to know how far they've traveled in total.

So, if they go west for 80 miles and then north for 150 miles, we add those two numbers together:

80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

So, the total distance each train has traveled in two days is 230 miles. 

The answer is: **230 miles**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Jill gets paid two different jobs. She teaches for 35 hours a week and gets paid $20 for each hour. She coaches for 15 hours a week and gets paid $30 for each hour. She works 50 weeks a year in both jobs.

First, let's find out how much she makes from teaching in a year:
- She works 35 hours a week and gets $20 for each hour, so that's 35 * $20 = $700 per week.
- She works 50 weeks a year, so her yearly teaching pay is $700 * 50 = $35,000.

Next, let's find out how much she makes from coaching in a year:
- She works 15 hours a week and gets $30 for each hour, so that's 15 * $30 = $450 per week.
- She works 50 weeks a year, so her yearly coaching pay is $450 * 50 = $22,500.

Now, to find her total yearly pay, we add the two amounts together:
- Her total yearly pay is $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so she uses 3 eggs each day. In one week, she uses 3 eggs/day times 7 days, which is 21 eggs. Now, if we count for 4 weeks, she uses 21 eggs/week times 4 weeks, which is 84 eggs.

Now, we know that 12 eggs make a dozen. So, to find out how many dozens of eggs she eats in 4 weeks, we divide the total number of eggs by 12. So, 84 eggs divided by 12 is 7 dozens.

So, the answer is 7 dozens of eggs."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Marissa has a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. So far, she's spent 2 hours walking 6 miles. She wants to finish the trail in 3 hours to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

That means she has 1 hour left to walk the rest of the trail. She has 6 miles left to walk. To find out how fast she needs to walk those miles, we divide the remaining distance by the time she has left.

So, 6 miles ÷ 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

The speed she needs to walk the remaining distance is 6 miles per hour."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

I have 10 liters of orange drink that's mostly water. If it's two-thirds water, that means I have about 6.67 liters of water in the orange drink. I also have 15 liters of pineapple drink that's three-fifths water, so that's about 9 liters of water in the pineapple drink.

When I mix them, I get about 15.67 liters of water in total. But then I spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so I only have 9 liters left.

Now, I need to find out how much water is in those 9 liters. Since I had 15.67 liters of water in the 10 liters of orange drink and the pineapple drink, and I only have 9 liters left, I can figure out how much water is in the 9 liters by using the total amount of water.

So, the amount of water in the 9 liters is about 15.67 liters times 9 liters divided by 10 liters, which gives me about 15.67 liters of water.

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters is about 15.67 liters."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Samantha is 31 years old now. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is 25 years old now.

Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. That means his son was born 2 years ago.

So, the son was born 2 years ago. The answer is 2."
"Sure, let me explain it in a simpler way. Billy had 8 customers on Tuesday. The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD, so that's 3 DVDs. The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs, so that's 4 DVDs. The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs. If we add up all the DVDs sold, we get 3 plus 4, which is 7 DVDs. So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle burns for 4 hours. We know that the candle melts 2 centimeters every hour it burns. So, if it burns for 4 hours, it will melt 2 centimeters per hour times 4 hours.

2 centimeters per hour times 4 hours equals 8 centimeters. So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. If Kyle got the book for $19.50 after a 25% discount, it means he paid 75% of the original price. So, if we think of the original price as 100%, then $19.50 is 75% of the original price.

To find out what 100% (the original price) was, we can divide $19.50 by 0.75. When we do that, we get $26. So, the original price of the book was $26."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Marie bought a chicken meal that cost $12, 5 packs of milk at $3 each, and 4 apples at $1.50 each. First, we add up the cost of these items:

- Chicken meal: $12
- Milk: 5 packs at $3 each = 5 × 3 = $15
- Apples: 4 apples at $1.50 each = 4 × 1.50 = $6

Now, let's add these up: $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the money left for the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she bought, we divide $17 by $8.50:

$17 ÷ $8.50 = 2.

So, Marie bought 2 boxes of pizza. The answer is 2."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mishka bought shorts, pants, and shoes. He bought 3 pairs of each. The shorts cost $16.50 each, pants cost $22.50 each, and shoes cost $42 each.

First, let's find out how much he spent on shorts:
- He bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair costs $16.50.
- So, 3 pairs cost 3 * $16.50 = $59.50.

Next, let's find out how much he spent on pants:
- He bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair costs $22.50.
- So, 3 pairs cost 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Then, let's find out how much he spent on shoes:
- He bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair costs $42.
- So, 3 pairs cost 3 * $42 = $126.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Shorts: $59.50
- Pants: $67.50
- Shoes: $126

Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $253.

So, Mishka spent $253 in total. The answer is $253."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Cynthia eats one scoop of ice cream every night. She buys ice cream in packs that have 15 scoops each, and each pack costs $4.00. We want to know how much she spends on ice cream after 60 days.

First, we need to find out how many scoops she eats in 60 days. Since she eats one scoop a night, in 60 days she eats 60 scoops.

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of ice cream she needs. Each pack has 15 scoops, so we divide the total scoops by the scoops in a pack:
\[ 60 \div 15 = 4 \]
So, she needs 4 packs of ice cream.

Each pack costs $4.00, so for 4 packs, she spends:
\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \]
So, Cynthia spends $16 on ice cream after 60 days.

The answer is $16."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Henry went on a bike trip that was 60 miles long. He stopped after riding 20 miles. So, he had 60 - 20 = 40 miles left to ride. But he stopped 15 miles before the end, so he rode 45 miles in total (60 - 15 = 45). Now, to find out how far he rode between his first and second stops, we take the total distance he rode (45 miles) and subtract the distance he rode before his first stop (20 miles). So, 45 - 20 = 25 miles.

Henry rode 25 miles between his first and second stops."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Gloria found a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels. The two pairs of high heels cost $33 and $66 together. So, the high heels cost $99 in total. The boots cost five dollars more than the high heels. So, if the high heels cost $99, the boots must cost $99 plus $5, which is $104. So, the boots cost $104."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have two friends, Darrell and Allen. Their ages are in a special ratio, 7:11. That means for every 7 years Darrell has, Allen has 11 years. Together, they add up to 162 years.

To find out how old each is, we can think of it like this: if we split 162 years into 18 parts (because 7 + 11 = 18), each part would be 162 divided by 18, which is 9. So, Darrell is 7 parts, which is 7 times 9, and that's 63. And Allen is 11 parts, which is 11 times 9, and that's 99.

Now, if we want to know how old Allen will be 10 years from now, we just add 10 to his current age. So, 99 plus 10 is 109.

So, Allen will be 109 years old 10 years from now."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Gunter asked his friends how many jelly beans are in a jar. One friend said 80. Another friend said 20 more than half of 80, which is 40, plus 20, so that's 60. The third friend said 25% more than 80, which is 20 more, so that's 100.

Now, we have three guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find out what most people guessed, we add these numbers together and then divide by 3 because there are 3 guesses.

So, we add them up: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. Then we divide 240 by 3: 240 ÷ 3 = 80.

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog needs 0.5 hours a day. So, for all the dogs, he needs:
\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours a day} \]

Now, there are 7 days in a week, so in a week, he spends:
\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs. The answer is 35 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Gretchen has 110 coins in total. She has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. If we say she has 40 silver coins, then she must have 70 gold coins because 40 (silver) + 30 = 70 (gold). So, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is 70."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know Raymond has 40 jewels. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of what Raymond has. So, half of Raymond's jewels is 40 divided by 2, which is 20. Then we add 5 to 20, so Aaron has 25 jewels.

Now, Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we take 25 and subtract 2, which gives us 23. Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

The final answer is 23."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the next 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. We need to find out how many points he scored in total.

First, in the first 20 minutes, he scored 4 points. That's easy to remember.

Now, for the next 20 minutes, he scores 25% more than 4 points. To find 25% of 4, we do:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, he scores 1 more point than he did in the first 20 minutes. That means he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, to find the total points, we add the points from both parts:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \]

So, Mike scored a total of 9 points. The answer is 9."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Terry eats 2 yogurts a day. If they are sold in packs of 4 for $5.00, we need to find out how many packs Terry will get in 30 days and then how much he spends.

First, Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so in 30 days, he eats:
\[ 2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts} \]

Now, if we have packs of 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to find out how many packs of 4 are in 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \, \text{yogurts}}{4 \, \text{yogurts/pack}} = 15 \, \text{packs} \]

Since each pack costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 packs is:
\[ 15 \, \text{packs} \times 5 \, \text{\$/pack} = 75 \, \text{\$} \]

So, Terry spends $75 on yogurt over 30 days. The answer is $75."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John had 13 lego sets and he sold each for $15. So, he got 13 times 15 dollars from selling all his lego sets. That's 195 dollars.

Then he used that money to buy 8 video games, each costing 20 dollars. So, he spent 8 times 20 dollars, which is 160 dollars.

After buying the video games, he had 5 dollars left. So, the money he had left after buying the video games is 195 dollars minus 160 dollars, which is 35 dollars.

Since he had 35 dollars left and he spent all the money from selling his lego sets, it means he sold all his lego sets. So, he still has 0 lego sets.

The answer is: 0"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. John runs 60 miles in a week. He runs for 3 days, and on the first day, he runs for 3 hours. The next two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, in total, he runs for 3 hours on the first day and 1.5 hours on each of the next two days. That's 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours in total.

He runs 60 miles in 6 hours, so to find out how fast he runs, we divide the total miles by the total hours. That's 60 miles divided by 6 hours, which equals 10 miles per hour.

So, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The answer is 10 miles per hour."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Dana can run four times faster than she can walk. If she skips, she goes at half the speed she runs. We know she skips at 3 miles per hour. So, if she skips at 3 mph, that means she runs at 6 mph because 3 times 2 is 6.

Now, she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. If she runs for 2 hours (one-third of 6 hours) and walks for 4 hours (two-thirds of 6 hours), we can figure out how far she goes.

For running:
- Speed = 6 mph
- Time = 2 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 6 × 2 = 12 miles

For walking:
- Speed = 1.5 mph (because walking speed is half of running speed)
- Time = 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 1.5 × 4 = 6 miles

So, the total distance she travels in 6 hours is 12 miles from running plus 6 miles from walking, which is 18 miles.

The answer is 18 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have Suzy's iPhone which is 1 year old. Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's, so that means Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. Now, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 times 2, which is 8 years old.

The dragon can breathe fire up to 1000 feet away. Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. But when she has the gemstone, she can throw it three times as far. So, with the gemstone, she can throw it 400 times 3, which is 1200 feet.

Now, we need to know how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, and Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet. So, if we subtract the dragon's reach from the farthest Polly can throw, we get:

1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet.

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still throw the javelin. The answer is 200 feet."

Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, she had 5 times 8 pieces, which is 40 pieces in total.

After the party, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces the guests ate, we need to take the total pieces and subtract the pieces left.

So, 40 pieces minus 14 pieces equals 26 pieces.

The guests took 26 pieces of pie. 

So, the answer is 26."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. A bag of chips has 250 calories in each part, and a big bag has 5 of these parts. So, each part is 250 calories, and the big bag has 5 parts, making it 1250 calories in total.

Now, you want to eat until you have 2000 calories for the day, but you've already had 1800 calories. So, you can have 200 calories left. Since each part of the chips has 250 calories, you can have 4 parts with the 200 calories left. Each part is 50 grams, so you can eat 4 parts, which is 200 grams.

So, the answer is 200 grams."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Charlie wants to sell candles and he needs beeswax to make them. For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles. He needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles because 2 times 10 is 20.

Now, to make 20 candles, he spends $10 on beeswax and wicks. If he sells each candle for $2, he can make $40 because 20 times 2 is 40.

So, his net profit is the money he makes from selling the candles minus the money he spent on making them. That means $40 minus $10, which is $30.

So, his net profit is $30. If I had to pick from the options given, the answer would be $30."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Meredith writes articles about health stuff. Each article takes her 4 hours to write. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote a bit more. She wrote 2/5 times more than she did on Monday, so that's 2/5 of 5, which is 2 more articles. So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many as she did on Tuesday, so that's 2 times 7, which is 14 articles.

Now, let's add up all the articles she wrote:
- Monday: 5 articles
- Tuesday: 7 articles
- Wednesday: 14 articles

So, she wrote a total of 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we multiply the total number of articles by 4 hours:
26 articles * 4 hours/article = 104 hours.

So, Meredith spent 104 hours writing articles last week. The answer is 104 hours."
"Oh, okay. So Candice started with 80 post-it notes and used 220 of them at work. She had 23 left. That means she must have bought some more to make up the difference. If she had 23 left after using 220, she must have bought 220 - 23 = 197 more post-it notes. So, the package she bought had 197 post-it notes in it. 

The answer is: **197**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. John bought blue ties for $200 at $40 each, so he bought 5 blue ties. He bought twice as many red ties, so he bought 10 red ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ones, so each red tie costs $60. So, the 10 red ties cost him $600. Adding the $200 he spent on blue ties, he spent a total of $800. So, the answer is $800."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tracy had a wire that was 4 feet long. She wanted to cut it into pieces that were each 6 inches long. First, we need to know how many inches are in 4 feet. Well, there are 12 inches in a foot, so 4 feet would be 4 times 12, which is 48 inches.

Now, Tracy wants to cut her 48-inch wire into pieces that are 6 inches each. To find out how many pieces she can get, we divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece. So, 48 inches divided by 6 inches per piece equals 8 pieces.

So, Tracy got 8 pieces of wire. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a building with 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, if we multiply the floors by the units per floor, we get the total number of units. That's 15 floors times 8 units, which equals 120 units.

Now, 3 out of every 4 units are occupied. To find out how many units are occupied, we take 3/4 of 120 units. That's 90 units.

To find out how many units are not occupied, we take the total number of units and subtract the number of occupied units. So, 120 units minus 90 units equals 30 units.

So, the number of unoccupied units is 30."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Lloyd's chickens make 252 eggs every day. If he sells each dozen (which is 12 eggs) for $2, we first need to find out how many dozens of eggs he gets from 252 eggs.

To find out how many dozens he gets:
- He has 252 eggs.
- Each dozen is 12 eggs.
- So, he gets \(252 \div 12 = 21\) dozens of eggs.

Now, if he sells each dozen for $2, then:
- For 21 dozens, he gets \(21 \times 2 = 42\) dollars.

Now, we need to know how much he makes in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
- In a week, he makes \(42 \times 7 = 294\) dollars.

So, Lloyd makes 294 dollars on eggs per week. The answer is \(\boxed{294}\)."
"Oh, hello there! Let me see if I can help you out with this. So, Tom's ship can go 10 miles in an hour, and he's sailing from 1 to 4 PM. That's three hours, right? Then he has to go back, but he's going slower, at 6 miles per hour. Now, we need to figure out how long it takes him to go back.

If he went 10 miles in 3 hours, that means he's sailing 10 miles every 3 hours. To go back, he's going 6 miles in an hour. So, if he needs to go 10 miles back, it would take him 10 miles divided by 6 miles per hour, which is about 1.67 hours. 

So, the time it takes him to get back is about 1.67 hours. If we had to pick from the options, it would be closest to 2 hours. So, the answer would be 2 hours. 

Does that make sense?"
"Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy, and he needs to remove 15 pounds from it. He has comic books that weigh 1/4 pound each and toys that weigh 1/2 pound each. He decides to remove 30 comic books. We need to find out how many toys he should remove to make the bag lighter by 15 pounds.

First, let's see how much the 30 comic books weigh together. Each comic book is 1/4 pound, so 30 comic books would be:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, he needs to remove a total of 15 pounds, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds with the comic books. So, he needs to remove:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds, we divide 7.5 by the weight of one toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to make his book bag lighter by 15 pounds. The answer is:

**15 toys**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easy to understand.

The mechanic works on different cars and trucks. For each truck tire, he charges $60, and for each car tire, he charges $40.

On Thursday, he worked on 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. So, for the truck tires, he made:
\[ 6 \times 60 = 360 \]
And for the car tires, he made:
\[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \]
So, the total for Thursday was:
\[ 360 + 160 = 520 \]

On Friday, he only worked on car tires and repaired 12 of them. So, he made:
\[ 12 \times 40 = 480 \]

Now, to find out which day he made more money, we compare:
- Thursday: $520
- Friday: $480

Thursday made more money than Friday. So, the difference is:
\[ 520 - 480 = 40 \]

So, the mechanic made $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Oh, okay. So the Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the shelter. Then their mom told them that their other two cats had kittens too. One cat, Patchy, had three times as many kittens as the adopted ones, so that's 3 times 7, which is 21 kittens. The other cat, Trixie, had 12 kittens. So, to find out how many kittens they have now, we add the adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens together. That's 7 plus 21 plus 12, which equals 40. So, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens."
"Jean had 30 lollipops and she ate 2, so she had 28 left. She wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag. To find out how many bags she can make, we divide the 28 lollipops by 2.

So, Jean can fill 14 bags. 

The answer is: 14"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Peter wants to go to the movies. He spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn each time. So, that's $14 for one trip.

He has $42 to spend. To find out how many times he can go, we divide the total money he has by the cost of one trip.

\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his money. The answer is 3."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a bridge that can only hold 5000 pounds. The truck and the driver together weigh 3755 pounds. So, we can add 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds to the truck with boxes.

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes we can put on, we divide 1245 by 15. 

1245 ÷ 15 = 83

So, we can put 83 boxes on the truck. The answer is 83."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Stephen ordered groceries that cost $40. The delivery people added a fee that was 25% of $40, which is $10. So, the groceries plus the delivery fee became $40 + $10 = $50. Then, Stephen added a $4 tip. So, the final price was $50 + $4 = $54. So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $54."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine you have a big bush of raspberries. This bush has 6 groups of raspberries, and each group has 20 raspberries. So, if we count all those groups, we get:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Now, besides those groups, there are also 67 raspberries scattered all over the bush. So, we add those to the 120 raspberries we counted:
\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

So, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 187."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 25 oranges in total. Out of these, 1 is bad, 5 are unripe, and 2 are sour. To find out how many are good, we need to subtract the bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total.

So, we do:
25 (total oranges) - 1 (bad) - 5 (unripe) - 2 (sour) = 17 good oranges.

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. Janet buys a brooch for her daughter. She spends $500 on the material and $800 on the jeweler to make it. So, the total cost before insurance is $500 + $800 = $1300. Now, she has to pay 10% of $1300 to get it insured. So, 10% of $1300 is $130. Adding the insurance cost to the total cost, she pays $1300 + $130 = $1430. So, the total amount Janet paid is $1430."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Marcy works for 40 years, and she gets a pension. For the first 20 years, she gets $50,000 a year. That's a lot of money, isn't it? But after 20 years, she starts getting a smaller amount. Starting from the 21st year, she gets 5% of the total pension she had after 20 years. So, after 20 years, she had $1,000,000. For the next 10 years, she gets 5% of $1,000,000 each year, which is $50,000 a year.

Now, if she quits after 30 years, she still gets the $50,000 a year for the next 10 years. So, her total pension for the 30 years is $50,000 a year for the first 20 years plus $50,000 a year for the next 10 years. That makes it $100,000 a year.

So, her annual pension after 30 years is $100,000."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The streaming service costs $140 each month. For the first half of the year, which is 6 months, the cost is:
\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

For the second half of the year, which is also 6 months, the cost is 10% less than $140. So, we first find 10% of $140:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 140 = 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Then we subtract this from $140 to get the new cost for the second half:
\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

So for the second half of the year, the cost is:
\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of both halves of the year:
\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Aleena paid by the end of the year is $1596."

Sophia's car has a big tank that can hold 12 gallons of gas. She used 4 gallons to drive 100 miles. So, to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we first figure out how many miles she can drive with 1 gallon of gas. She drove 100 miles with 4 gallons, so with 1 gallon, she can drive:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now, if her tank can hold 12 gallons, then the total miles she can drive on a full tank is:

\[ 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a full tank of gas. The answer is 300 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Jim watches TV for 2 hours and then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour. So in one go, he spends 3 hours. He does this 3 times in a week, so that's 9 hours a week. Over 4 weeks, he spends 4 times 9 hours, which is 36 hours. So the total time Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 36 hours. The answer is 36 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Each school sends:
- 5 girls' players
- 5 boys' players
- 1 coach for girls
- 1 coach for boys

So, each school sends 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12 people.

Since there are 4 schools, that means 4 schools times 12 people each school equals 48 people in total.

So, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The treasure hunter found a chest with gems. There were 175 diamonds. For rubies, it said there were 35 fewer than diamonds, so that means there were 175 - 35 = 140 rubies. And for emeralds, it said there were twice as many as rubies, so that means there were 2 * 140 = 280 emeralds.

Now, to find out how many gems there were in total, we add up all the gems:
175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 emeralds = 605 gems.

So, the total number of gems in the chest is 605."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know there are 60 girls at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, that means there are 120 boys. So, the total number of students is the number of boys plus the number of girls, which is 60 girls + 120 boys = 180 students.

Now, we're told that for every teacher, there are 5 students. So, to find out how many teachers there are, we divide the total number of students by 5. That means 180 students ÷ 5 = 36 teachers.

So, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is 36."
"Bailey starts with some money and then gets $5 every week for 8 weeks. At the end, she has $100. To find out how much she started with, we need to see how much she got from her allowance and subtract that from the total she has.

She gets $5 a week for 8 weeks, so:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]
This means she got $40 from her allowance. If she ends up with $100, we subtract the $40 she got from her allowance from the $100 she has:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60. The answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way.

Judy teaches dance classes. She has 5 days to teach 5 classes each day on weekdays. That's 5 days times 5 classes, which is 25 classes. On Saturdays, she teaches 8 classes. So, in one week, she teaches 25 classes on weekdays and 8 classes on Saturday, which is 33 classes in total.

Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15.00 per student. So, for 25 classes, she makes 25 times 15 dollars, which is 375 dollars. For the 8 classes on Saturday, she makes 8 times 15 dollars, which is 120 dollars.

Now, to find out how much she makes in one week, we add the money she makes from weekdays and Saturday classes together. So, 375 dollars plus 120 dollars equals 495 dollars.

So, the total money Judy makes in one week is 495 dollars. 

The answer is: **495**"

20 steps + 40 steps = 60 steps

Kelian has to read 60 steps in total. So, the answer is 60."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tommy sells brownies and cheesecakes. He sells 43 brownies at $3 each and 23 cheesecakes at $4 each. To find out how much money he makes, we need to do some math.

First, for the brownies:
- He sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie costs $3.
- So, 43 times 3 is 129 dollars from the brownies.

Next, for the cheesecakes:
- He sells 23 cheesecakes.
- Each cheesecake costs $4.
- So, 23 times 4 is 92 dollars from the cheesecakes.

Now, to find out the total money he makes, we add the money from the brownies and the cheesecakes together:
- 129 dollars from the brownies plus 92 dollars from the cheesecakes equals 221 dollars.

So, Tommy makes 221 dollars in total."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Shiela bought 5 cell phones, each costing $150. So, the total cost of the phones is:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, there's a 2% interest on each phone. So, for one phone, the interest is:
\[ 150 \times 0.02 = 3 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she bought 5 phones, the total interest is:
\[ 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount she has to pay is:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \text{ dollars} \]

She has to pay this amount over 3 months. So, the amount she pays each month is:
\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Shiela will pay \(\boxed{255}\) dollars each month for 3 months."

Artie has a flower stand and he's rounding the prices to the nearest dollar because he doesn't want any change. He sells different kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. Here are the prices he's rounding to:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

Now, he sells different numbers of each flower:

- 12 pots of marigolds at $3.00 each
- 9 pots of petunias at $2.00 each
- 17 pots of begonias at $2.00 each

Let's calculate how much he makes from each type of flower:

- From marigolds: \(12 \times 3.00 = 36.00\)
- From petunias: \(9 \times 2.00 = 18.00\)
- From begonias: \(17 \times 2.00 = 34.00\)

Now, let's add them all up:

\(36.00 + 18.00 + 34.00 = 88.00\)

So, Artie makes $88.00. The answer is \(\boxed{88.00}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Luke is making a sandcastle with 4 levels, and the top level is 16 square feet. Each level below has half the square feet of the level above it. So, we need to find out how big each level is and then find the average.

1. The top level (level 4) is 16 square feet.
2. The level below it (level 3) is half of 16, so it's 8 square feet.
3. The level below that (level 2) is half of 8, so it's 4 square feet.
4. The level below that (level 1) is half of 4, so it's 2 square feet.

Now, we add up all the square feet: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 square feet.

Since there are 4 levels, we divide the total square feet by 4 to find the average: 30 ÷ 4 = 7.5 square feet.

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Cecilia's puppy needs 1 cup of dog food every day for the first 180 days. That's 180 cups of dog food. After that, the puppy needs 2 cups of dog food every day for the rest of its life. We know there are 365 days in a year, so after the first 180 days, there are 185 days left in the year.

For the 185 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of dog food each day, so that's 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups of dog food.

Now, we add the dog food needed for the first 180 days and the next 185 days together: 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups of dog food.

Each bag of dog food has 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia needs, we divide the total cups by the cups per bag: 550 cups / 110 cups/bag = 5 bags.

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year. The answer is 5 bags."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Now, David does half of what Sarah does, so we divide 400 by 4. That gives us 100 pounds of laundry for David.

Raymond does half of what Sarah does, so we take 400 and divide it by 2. That gives us 200 pounds of laundry for Raymond.

Now, to find out how much more Raymond does than David, we take Raymond's laundry and subtract David's laundry. So, 200 minus 100 is 100 pounds.

So, Raymond does 100 pounds more laundry than David. The answer is 100 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Vincent can buy flowers in two ways:
1. In packs of 3 for $2.50 each.
2. In packs of 2 for $1 each.

To get 18 flowers, he needs:
- 6 packs of 3 flowers because 18 divided by 3 is 6.
- So, 6 packs at $2.50 each cost 6 times $2.50, which is $15.

Or he can buy:
- 9 packs of 2 flowers because 18 divided by 2 is 9.
- So, 9 packs at $1 each cost 9 times $1, which is $9.

Now, to save money, he should buy the cheaper way, which is the packs of 2 for $1 each. The difference is $15 - $9 = $6.

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers in the cheaper way. The answer is $6."
"Sure, let me explain it in a simpler way. John wants to take his new dog to the groomer. The first time, it costs $100. But the groomer is giving a special offer: if it's the first time, they give a 30% discount. 

To find out how much John has to pay now, we need to take 30% off $100. 

First, we calculate 30% of $100, which is $30. 

Then, we subtract $30 from $100, so John only has to pay $70.

So, the cost of grooming the dog now is $70. 

The answer is: **$70**"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We start with 24 liters of water. Two girls each get 1/6 of that, so that's 4 liters each. That's 8 liters in total for the girls. Then a boy gets 6 liters. So, we add up all the water they got: 8 liters for the girls plus 6 liters for the boy, which makes 14 liters. We started with 24 liters, so if we take away the 14 liters they got, we're left with 10 liters. So, the answer is 10 liters."
"Charlie started with 10 stickers. Then he got 21 more from the store and 23 more for his birthday. So he had 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 stickers. But then he gave 9 stickers to his sister, so he had 54 - 9 = 45 stickers left. After that, he used 28 stickers to make a card, so he had 45 - 28 = 17 stickers left. Therefore, the number of stickers Charlie has left is 17. The answer is 17."

Grace weighs 125 pounds. Now, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. So, first, we find out how much 4 times Grace's weight is. That's 4 times 125, which is 500 pounds. Then we take 2 pounds off that, so Alex weighs 498 pounds.

Now, to find out their total weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together. So, 125 plus 498 is 623 pounds.

So, their combined weight is 623 pounds."

Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each bush has 25 roses. So, that's 3 times 25 roses, which makes 75 roses in total.

Now, each rose has 8 thorns. So, if we have 75 roses, and each has 8 thorns, we multiply 75 by 8 to find out how many thorns there are in total.

75 times 8 is 600.

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, they played 22 games in total. They lost some games and won more than they lost. They won 8 more games than they lost. If we say they lost 7 games, then they won 15 games because 7 (lost) + 8 (more than they lost) = 15 (won).

So, the number of games they won is 15."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Gene goes on 4 vacations each year. He started when he was 23 and now he's 34. So, he's been going for 34 - 23 = 11 years. That means he's had 11 vacations. Since each vacation is a quilt block, he has 11 quilt blocks in total. So, the answer is 11 quilt blocks."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine Greg's alarm goes off three times a day. The first time it goes off, it rings 4 times. The second time, it rings for three times as long as the first time, so that's 4 times times 3, which is 12 times. The third time, it rings for half as long as the second time, so that's 12 times divided by 2, which is 6 times.

Now, if we add up all the times it rang:
- First time: 4 times
- Second time: 12 times
- Third time: 6 times

So, 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.

The alarm rang 22 times in total."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Sylvie gets paid $600 a month at her job. The company says if she stays for 5 years, they'll give her a raise. So, they'll give her a 10% raise on her $600 salary.

First, we calculate the raise:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60 \]

So, her new salary after the first year will be:
\[ \$600 + \$60 = \$660 \]

Then, in the second year, they'll give her another 10% raise on her new salary of $660:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66 \]

So, her new salary after the second year will be:
\[ \$660 + \$66 = \$726 \]

And in the third year, they'll give her another 10% raise on her new salary of $726:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } \$726 = 0.10 \times 726 = \$72.60 \]

So, her new salary after the third year will be:
\[ \$726 + \$72.60 = \$798.60 \]

So, after three more years of working, Sylvie will be getting paid $798.60 a month. If we need to pick from the options given, the closest one would be $798.60."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine Harald sold some records, and let's say he sold 8,000 records. Now, Marilyn sold 10 times as many as Harald. So if Harald sold 8,000, Marilyn sold 10 times that, which is 80,000.

Now, if we add Harald's and Marilyn's sales together, we get 8,000 + 80,000 = 88,000. That matches the total number of records sold.

So, Harald sold 8,000 records. The answer is 8000."
"Christina invited 16 friends, but 1 out of every 4 friends doesn't come. So, 3 out of every 4 friends do come. That means:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12 \text{ friends come.} \]

Now, she needs 0.75 gift bags for each friend who comes. So, she needs:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \text{ gift bags.} \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars.} \]

So, Christina will spend:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ted wants to make potato salad for a picnic. He knows that big dinosaurs, which we call adults, eat 10 pounds of potato salad each. Little dinosaurs, which we call children, eat half as much, so they eat 5 pounds each.

At the picnic, there will be 20 big dinosaurs and 5 little dinosaurs. So, we need to figure out how much potato salad all these dinosaurs will eat.

First, we calculate how much the big dinosaurs eat:
- 20 big dinosaurs × 10 pounds each = 200 pounds

Then, we calculate how much the little dinosaurs eat:
- 5 little dinosaurs × 5 pounds each = 25 pounds

Now, we add these two amounts together to find out the total:
- 200 pounds + 25 pounds = 225 pounds

So, Ted needs to make 225 pounds of potato salad to feed everyone at the picnic. The answer is 225 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Cindy has 4 pets. Marcia has 2 more than Cindy, so Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Now, to find out how many pets they all have together, we add up all their pets: 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28 pets.

So, the total number of pets they have is 28."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a family with four kids named Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James. We know James is 10 years old and he's 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 11 years old because if James is 10, Corey is 10 + 1.

Now, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. And Amy is also 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11, Amy must be 11 - 2 = 9 years old. If Amy is 9 and she's 5 years older than Jackson, then Jackson must be 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. Lee used to be able to run it two seconds faster than Gerald. So, Gerald used to run it in 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald changed his diet and got faster by 10%. If Lee runs it in 38 seconds, that means Lee's speed is 10.53 meters per second (400 meters in 38 seconds).

Gerald's original speed was 10 meters per second (400 meters in 40 seconds). With a 10% improvement, Gerald's new speed is 11 meters per second (400 meters in 36.36 seconds).

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in about 36.36 seconds. The closest answer from the options given would be 36.36 seconds.

The final answer is: **36.36 seconds**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 60 dogs. For every dog, there are 2 cats, so we have 120 cats. The number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats. So, we add the number of dogs and cats together, which is 60 + 120 = 180. Then we take 12 away, so we have 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits. Now, to find the total number of pets, we add the dogs, cats, and rabbits together: 60 + 120 + 168 = 348. So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have 200 students in Grade 5. Out of these, 2/5 are boys, so we have 80 boys. That means the rest are girls, which is 200 - 80 = 120 girls.

Now, 2/3 of these girls are in the girl scout. So, we calculate 2/3 of 120, which is 80 girls in the girl scout.

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls. So, 120 - 80 = 40 girls are not in the girl scout.

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Harry slept 9 hours last night. James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, so we calculate it like this: 2/3 of 9 is 6 hours. Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the hours James slept from the hours Harry slept. So, 9 minus 6 is 3. Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The answer is 3 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Freda makes sauce from canned tomatoes, and when she cooks them, they lose half their volume. Each can of tomatoes she uses has 16 ounces, and she uses 3 tomatoes in each can.

She made 32 ounces of sauce this time. To find out how much tomatoes she used, we need to think about it step by step.

First, since the sauce is half the volume of the tomatoes before cooking, we double the sauce to find the original volume of tomatoes:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we know each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, and she needs 64 ounces of tomatoes. To find out how many cans she used, we divide the total ounces of tomatoes by the ounces in one can:
\[ 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can has 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by the number of tomatoes per can to find the total number of tomatoes:
\[ 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes. The answer is 12 tomatoes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Imagine we have a line of 30 cars on the motorway. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam. Then, in the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through. But 5 cars decide to leave the motorway before the traffic gets worse. If we count the cars that left, we have 5 cars. So, the cars that stayed and drove through the traffic jam are the ones that were originally there minus the 5 that left and the 20 that came later.

If we take it step by step:
- We start with 30 cars.
- 5 cars leave, so we have 30 - 5 = 25 cars left.
- Then 20 more cars drive through, so we have 25 - 20 = 5 cars left.

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The answer is: **5**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mary had 2 plants on each of her 40 ledges. So, she had 2 times 40 plants, which is 80 plants. Then she got 18 more plants from the nursery, so she had 80 plus 18, which is 98 plants.

She's going to give 1 plant from each of her 40 ledges to friends and family. So, she'll give away 40 plants.

Now, if she gives away 40 plants from her 98 plants, she'll have 98 minus 40, which is 58 plants left.

So, Mary will have 58 plants left. The answer is 58."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have four friends visiting Jerome. Here's how many times each friend pressed the doorbell:

1. The first friend pressed it 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed it 1/4 more than the first friend, so that's 20 + 5 = 25 times.
3. The fourth friend pressed it 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed it 10 more times than the fourth friend, so that's 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add all these up: 20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175.

So, the total number of times the doorbell was pressed is 175."
"Solo needs to read a total of 39 pages. He read 15 pages on Monday, so he has 24 pages left to read. He has 4 more days to finish his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left. So, 24 pages divided by 4 days equals 6 pages per day. 

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages each day for the next 4 days. The answer is 6 pages per day."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. John drinks water with his meals every day. He has breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a glass of water before bed. That's 4 glasses of water a day. He does this from Monday to Friday, which is 5 days. So, for 5 days, he drinks 4 glasses/day * 5 days = 20 glasses of water.

On weekends, he doesn't drink water with dinner. He drinks only 1 glass of water before bed. So, for 2 days, he drinks 1 glass/day * 2 days = 2 glasses of water.

Now, if we add the water he drinks during the weekdays and the weekends, we get 20 glasses + 2 glasses = 22 glasses of water in a week.

So, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is 22."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine the city is like a big line that's 42 miles long. Now, a fog bank can cover 3 miles in 10 minutes. We want to know how long it will take to cover the whole city.

First, we figure out how long it takes to cover 1 mile. Since 3 miles take 10 minutes, 1 mile would take less time. We can find out by dividing 10 minutes by 3, which gives us about 3.33 minutes for 1 mile.

Now, to cover 42 miles, we multiply 3.33 minutes by 42. So, it's like having 42 groups of 3.33 minutes. If we do the math, it comes out to be 140 minutes.

So, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city. The answer is 140 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Poppy starts with a big puzzle that has 1000 pieces. She puts a quarter of them on the board. A quarter of 1000 is 250 pieces. So, she puts 250 pieces on the board and has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.

Then, Poppy's mom comes and puts a third of the remaining pieces on the board. A third of 750 is 250 pieces. So, her mom puts 250 more pieces on the board and now there are 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

So, the number of pieces left to be placed is 500."
"Okay, let me think this through. If Amir eats 5 cookies, and Cody eats three times as many, that means Cody eats 15 cookies. So together, they eat 5 plus 15, which is 20 cookies. So the total number of cookies they eat together is 20."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John has 3 boxes, and each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. But the walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to take that into account.

First, let's figure out how big the inside of one box is. If the walls are 1 inch thick, that means we take away 1 inch from each side of the length, width, and height. So, for the length, we have 5 inches minus 2 inches (1 inch from each side), which is 3 inches. For the width, it's 6 inches minus 2 inches, which is 4 inches. And for the height, it's 4 inches minus 2 inches, which is 2 inches.

Now, we know the inside size of one box is 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches. To find out how much space is inside one box, we multiply these numbers together: 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the space of one box by 3: 24 cubic inches * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches. The answer is 72."
"Oh, okay. So Frankie watches TV after he does his homework every night. On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one hour of his favorite show each day. On Wednesday, he watches a little bit of a show that's only half an hour. On Thursday, he finishes his homework early and watches one hour and a half. On Friday, he gets to stay up late and watches two full hours of TV.

Now, if he watched a total of seven hours of TV, we need to figure out how many half-hour shows he watched on Wednesday. 

From Monday to Thursday, he watched:
- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 0.5 hour
- Thursday: 1.5 hours

That's 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 = 4 hours. 

So, he watched 7 - 4 = 3 hours on Friday, which is two full hours. 

That means he watched 3 hours on Wednesday, and since each show is half an hour, he watched 3 / 0.5 = 6 half-hour shows.

So, the number of half-hour shows he watched on Wednesday is 6."
"Oh, okay. Let me walk you through this like I'm not so smart.

So, Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year. That means if he made \( x \) cookies last year, this year he wanted to make \( 2x \) cookies. But he ended up making 15 more than he wanted, so he made \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

Then he dropped 5 cookies, so he had \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies left. And we know he ended up with 110 cookies. So we have:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ 2x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry made 50 cookies last year. That's the answer, isn't it?"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The gas station sells gas for $3.00 a gallon. If you buy 10 gallons, that's 10 times $3.00, so that's $30.00.

Now, they give you $0.20 back for every gallon you buy. So for 10 gallons, that's 10 times $0.20, which is $2.00.

So, you spend $30.00 but get $2.00 back. That means you end up paying $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

So, the final amount you pay is $28.00."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have two people, Marcell and Beatrice, eating fruit roll-ups. Beatrice's roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so she eats 2 times 24, which is 48 roll-ups. Marcell's roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so he eats 3 times 14, which is 42 roll-ups.

Now, if we add up all the roll-ups they ate together, it's 48 plus 42, which is 90 roll-ups in total.

To find out how many they ate on average, we take the total and divide it by 2 because there are two of them. So, 90 divided by 2 is 45.

So, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups each. The answer is 45."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, so she rows 1.25 feet every second. The shore is 64 seconds away, so she rows 80 feet to get there. For every 10 feet she rows, the boat takes on 2 liters of water. So, for 80 feet, the boat would take on 16 liters of water. 

So, the boat took on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore. The answer is 16 liters."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 4 teachers, and each teacher has 2 lessons a day. So, that's 4 times 2, which is 8 lessons in total for the whole day.

Now, in each lesson, the whiteboard gets cleaned 3 times. So, if there are 8 lessons, we multiply 8 by 3 to find out how many times the whiteboard gets cleaned.

8 times 3 is 24.

So, the whiteboard gets cleaned 24 times in a day. The answer is 24."
"Oh, hello there! Let me help you with this. So, Ryan plants 2 flowers every day. If he does this for 15 days, he plants:

\[ 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ flowers} \]

But then, 5 of those flowers didn't grow. So, the number of flowers that actually grew is:

\[ 30 - 5 = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the answer is 25 flowers."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos. That's a lot, right? Now, if Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, we can figure out how many photos Brittany's phone can hold. So, if 1800 is 6 times Brittany's number, we divide 1800 by 6 to find out how many photos Brittany's phone can hold. 

\[ 1800 \div 6 = 300 \]

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photos. Now, we know that the number of photos Brittany's phone can hold (300) is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photo. To find out how many ducks are in Jamal's photo, we divide 300 by 50.

\[ 300 \div 50 = 6 \]

So, Jamal's photo of the ducks has 6 ducks in it. 

The answer is: **6**"
"Oh, okay. So Sasha had some lumber she didn't use and now she wants to sell it. She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 lumber that cost her $10 each, and 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 lumber that cost her $16 each. She's selling all of it.

First, let's see how much she spent on the lumber:
- For the 2 x 4 x 10 lumber, she spent \(10 \times 10 = \$100\).
- For the 4 x 4 x 10 lumber, she spent \(5 \times 16 = \$80\).

So, the total cost was \(100 + 80 = \$180\).

Now, if she sells all of it, she'll get the same amount back, which is \$180. Since she spent \$180 and got \$180 back, she doesn't make any profit or loss. So, her profit is \$0.

The answer is: \(\boxed{0}\)"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Katy mixes sugar and water in a special way. For every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water. She used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and water mixed together.

To find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used, we need to figure out how many parts the total is split into. The total parts are 7 (for sugar) + 13 (for water) = 20 parts.

Now, if 20 parts make up 120 teaspoons, then each part is 120 ÷ 20 = 6 teaspoons.

Since sugar is 7 parts, we multiply 7 by 6 to find out how many teaspoons of sugar she used: 7 × 6 = 42 teaspoons.

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar. The answer is 42."
"John has 3 children, and he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child. So, he buys 2 times 3, which is 6 pairs of shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $60. To find out how much he paid, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost of each pair. So, 6 times $60 is $360. Therefore, John paid $360. The answer is $360."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

At first, the customs officer counted 2 containers, and each container had 5 cars. So, that's 2 times 5, which is 10 cars.

The next day, the total number of cars became 30. If we take away the 10 cars that were there at first, we get 30 minus 10, which is 20 cars.

Now, if each container has 5 cars, and we have 20 cars, we can find out how many containers had these cars. We do this by dividing 20 by 5, which gives us 4.

So, 4 containers were brought in the next day. The answer is 4 containers."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Adrien's initial salary was $40,000. Four years later, his salary increased by 40%. So, we calculate 40% of $40,000 and add it to the original amount.

40% of $40,000 is:
\[ 0.40 \times 40,000 = 16,000 \]

So, Adrien's new salary is:
\[ 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \]

Lylah's salary was 30% less than Adrien's initial salary. So, we calculate 30% of $40,000 and subtract it from $40,000.

30% of $40,000 is:
\[ 0.30 \times 40,000 = 12,000 \]

So, Lylah's initial salary was:
\[ 40,000 - 12,000 = 28,000 \]

Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, we calculate 40% of $28,000 and add it to the original amount.

40% of $28,000 is:
\[ 0.40 \times 28,000 = 11,200 \]

So, Lylah's new salary is:
\[ 28,000 + 11,200 = 39,200 \]

Now, to find the total salary they were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's new salary and Lylah's new salary together.

\[ 56,000 + 39,200 = 95,200 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $95,200."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, he uses 2 times 30 sheets in a week, which is 60 sheets a week.

Now, a month has about 4 weeks. So, if he uses 60 sheets in one week, in 4 weeks he would use 60 times 4, which is 240 sheets.

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month. The answer is 240."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. So, that's 13 fruits in total.

Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, so that's 10 apples. And he brought half as many oranges as Morisette, so that's 4 oranges. That makes 14 fruits in total for Kael.

Now, if we add Morisette's and Kael's fruits together, we get 13 + 14 = 27 fruits.

So, the total number of fruits they brought is 27."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday. On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so that's 6 hours. On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so that's 4 hours. For Thursday and Friday, she slept 1 hour more than the total she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. So, Tuesday and Wednesday together she slept 6 + 4 = 10 hours. For Thursday and Friday, she slept 10 + 1 = 11 hours each day.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 4 hours
- Thursday: 11 hours
- Friday: 11 hours

So, 8 + 6 + 4 + 11 + 11 = 40 hours.

Sadie slept a total of 40 hours throughout the week."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Rosie runs for 3 hours at 10 miles per hour, so she covers 30 miles. After that, she runs for 4 more hours at 5 miles per hour, which means she covers 20 more miles. So, in total, she runs 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles. So, the answer is 50 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Jennie had a big pile of 60 letters that needed stamps. She stamped one-third of them, which is 20 letters. After stamping these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters that are already stamped. This means that before she started stamping, there were 30 - 20 = 10 letters that were already stamped. So, the answer is 10."
"Oh, hello there! Let me help you with this. So, Julia needed spoons for her dinner party. She was short of plastic ones, so she bought a new package. Her husband also got her 5 more spoons. While she was making the stew, she used 3 spoons to taste it. When she went to set the table, she had 12 spoons in total. Now, we need to figure out how many spoons she bought at the store.

Let's think about it step by step. First, she had some spoons before, then her husband gave her 5 more, but she used 3 for tasting. So, if we add the 5 spoons her husband gave her to the 3 she used, that's 8 spoons. Now, if we add those 8 spoons to the 12 spoons she had left, we get 20 spoons. That means she must have had 20 - 8 = 12 spoons before her husband gave her the new ones. But since she got 5 new ones, the number of spoons she bought must be 12 - 5 = 7.

So, the number of spoons in the package Julia bought is 7."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Dylan wanted to make sausage buns for a party. He got 38 chicken sausages. Now, he got more fish sausages than chicken sausages. The problem says he got 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he got 38 plus 6, which is 44 fish sausages.

Now, to find out how many sausages he got in total, we add the chicken sausages and the fish sausages together. So, 38 chicken sausages plus 44 fish sausages equals 82 sausages in total.

So, Dylan got 82 sausages in all. The answer is 82."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Lily made 50 friends. Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy made 50 plus 20, which is 70 friends.

Now, to find out how many friends they have together, we add Lily's friends to Amy's friends. So, 50 plus 70 is 120.

So, Lily and Amy together have 120 friends."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way without all the big words.

Well's mom sells fruits at the store. A watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, and an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon. Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. If each pepper costs 15 dollars, how much money will Dillon spend in total?

First, let's find out how much a watermelon costs. Since a pepper costs 15 dollars and a watermelon costs three times as much, a watermelon costs:
\[ 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, an orange costs 5 dollars less than a watermelon, so:
\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate how much Dillon will spend on each type of fruit:
- For watermelons: 4 watermelons at 45 dollars each is:
\[ 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]
- For peppers: 20 peppers at 15 dollars each is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]
- For oranges: 10 oranges at 40 dollars each is:
\[ 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total amount Dillon will spend, we add up all these costs:
\[ 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Dillon will spend 880 dollars in total. The answer is 880 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, and each visit takes 24 minutes. That means each person gets seen for 0.4 hours. So, if 500 people visit, that's 200 hours of seeing patients.

The hospital gets $200 for each hour from the patients, so for 200 hours, they get 200 times 200 dollars, which is 40,000 dollars.

The doctors get $150 for each hour they work, so for 200 hours, they get 200 times 150 dollars, which is 30,000 dollars.

To find out how much the hospital makes, we take the money from the patients and subtract the money the doctors get. So, 40,000 dollars minus 30,000 dollars equals 10,000 dollars.

So, the hospital makes 10,000 dollars from these visits. The answer is 10,000 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Nissa hired 60 elves to play in her store's Santa village. First, one third of them quit because the kids vomited on them. So, one third of 60 is 20, and that means 20 elves left. That leaves 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

Then, 10 more elves quit because the kids kicked them. So, 40 - 10 = 30 elves are left.

So, the number of elves left is 30."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

In May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $60 less, so that's $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, to find out how much he spent in total for May and June, we add the amounts from both months together: $500 + $440 = $940.

So, the total amount Joseph spent in those two months is $940."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. At the carnival, Pam went on the big spinning ride called the roller coaster 2 times and Fred went 4 times. Each time they went, they used 6 tickets. So, Pam used 2 times 6, which is 12 tickets for the roller coaster, and then she went on the luge 2 times, using another 12 tickets. That's a total of 24 tickets for Pam.

Fred went on the roller coaster 4 times, using 4 times 6, which is 24 tickets, and then he went on the luge 2 times, using another 12 tickets. So, Fred used 36 tickets in total.

Now, to find out how many tickets they used altogether, we add Pam's and Fred's tickets together: 24 tickets (Pam) + 36 tickets (Fred) = 60 tickets.

So, the total number of tickets they used that day is 60."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times that, so that's 6 times 4, which is 24 miles. So, from Monday to Tuesday, he walked 4 + 24 = 28 miles.

Now, we know that from Monday to Wednesday, he walked a total of 41 miles. If we take away the 28 miles he walked from Monday to Tuesday, we get 41 - 28 = 13 miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. The answer is 13 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tom gets 4 car washes every month. If each car wash costs $15, we need to find out how much he pays in a whole year.

First, we figure out how many car washes he gets in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:
\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Now, we know each car wash costs $15, so for 48 car washes, the total cost is:
\[ 48 \text{ car washes} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Brian started with 20 video games but lost 5, so he has 15 now. Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times what Brian has. So, 3 times 15 is 45, and if we take away 5, we get 40. So, Bobby has 40 video games.

The answer is: **40**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 27 unicorns in total. One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands, so that means 9 unicorns are there. Now, two thirds of these Scottish unicorns are female. So, we take two thirds of 9, which is 6. Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns. The answer is 6."
"Okay, let me break it down simply for you.

Rory orders 2 subs that cost $7.50 each, so that's 2 times $7.50, which is $15.00.

She also gets 2 bags of chips that cost $1.50 each, so that's 2 times $1.50, which is $3.00.

And she gets 2 cookies that cost $1.00 each, so that's 2 times $1.00, which is $2.00.

Now, if we add all these up, we get $15.00 for the subs, $3.00 for the chips, and $2.00 for the cookies. So, $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 = $20.00.

After she adds all this up, there's a 20% delivery fee. So, 20% of $20.00 is $4.00 (because 20% is the same as 20/100 or 0.20, and 0.20 times $20.00 is $4.00).

So, the total with the delivery fee is $20.00 + $4.00 = $24.00.

Then, she wants to add a $5.00 tip. So, $24.00 + $5.00 = $29.00.

So, the total cost of her order is $29.00."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without all the big words.

Mark had two tests. The first test had 75 questions and he took 8 hours to do it. He did 5 questions every hour, so in 8 hours, he did 40 questions. That means he left 75 - 40 = 35 questions unanswered.

The second test had 100 questions and he took 6 hours to do it. Again, he did 5 questions every hour, so in 6 hours, he did 30 questions. That means he left 100 - 30 = 70 questions unanswered.

Now, to find out how many questions he left unanswered in total, we add the unanswered questions from both tests: 35 + 70 = 105.

So, the total number of questions Mark left unanswered is 105."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 12 blue gumballs. The problem says there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. So, if we take the number of blue gumballs, which is 12, and multiply it by 4, we get 48. Then we add 22 to 48, and that gives us the number of pink gumballs.

So, 48 plus 22 is 70. That means there are 70 pink gumballs.

The answer is: 70"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We have 20 cars in total. Out of these, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the rest must be semi-automatic. To find out how many are semi-automatic, we subtract the automatic and manual cars from the total:

\[ 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, there are 4 semi-automatic cars. To find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we use this formula:

\[ \frac{4}{20} \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic. The answer is:

\[ 20\% \]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We have 700 bees in total. The problem tells us there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens. So, if we let the number of queens be Q, then the number of baby bees is 2Q, and the number of worker bees is 2 times the baby bees, which is 4Q.

If we add them all together, we get:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

So, we have 100 queens. Now, to find the number of baby bees:
\[ 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And for the worker bees:
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, and there are 7 days in a week. So, he plays for 2 hours/day × 7 days/week = 14 hours in a week. He earns $10 for every hour he works. So, if he works those 14 hours, he would earn 14 hours × $10/hour = $140. So, the money he would earn in one week is $140."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John buys some stuff and it costs him money. He buys milk for 2 dollars, eggs for 3 dollars, light bulbs for 3 dollars, cups for 3 dollars, and roach traps for 4 dollars. But there's a special rule: if he buys light bulbs or roach traps, he has to pay an extra 10% because they're not food.

First, let's look at the light bulbs and roach traps:
- Light bulbs cost 3 dollars, and with the 10% tax, it's 3 * 0.10 = 0.30 dollars extra. So, the total for light bulbs is 3 + 0.30 = 3.30 dollars.
- Roach traps cost 4 dollars, and with the 10% tax, it's 4 * 0.10 = 0.40 dollars extra. So, the total for roach traps is 4 + 0.40 = 4.40 dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the food items (milk, eggs, and cups):
- Milk costs 2 dollars.
- Eggs cost 3 dollars.
- Cups cost 3 dollars.

So, the total cost of the food items is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 dollars.

Now, we add the total cost of the non-food items:
- Light bulbs: 3.30 dollars
- Roach traps: 4.40 dollars
- Food items: 8 dollars

Adding these together: 3.30 + 4.40 + 8 = 15.70 dollars.

So, everything costs John 15.70 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Kim has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so he has 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. The bleach costs $2 per bottle and the cloths cost $5 each pack.

So, for 8 clients:
- The cost of bleach is 8 clients * 2 bottles/client * $2/bottle = $32.
- The cost of cloths is 8 clients * 1 pack/client * $5/pack = $40.

So, the total cost for all the clients is $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim makes $92 each week from his clients. So, his profit is $92 - $72 = $20.

So, the profit Kim makes each week is $20."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and he can get 100 pineapples from each hectare every 3 months. There are 12 months in a year, so he can harvest his pineapples 4 times in a year. From each hectare, he gets 100 pineapples, and he has 10 hectares, so in a year, he gets 4000 pineapples. So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is 4000."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Johnny has three lego boxes. The first one has 500 pieces. The second one has three times as many as the first one, so that's 3 times 500, which is 1500 pieces. The third one has a quarter of the first one, so that's 500 divided by 4, which is 125 pieces.

Now, to find out how many pieces Johnny picks up, I add them all together: 500 + 1500 + 125. That makes 2125 pieces in total.

So, Johnny picks up 2125 lego pieces."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. Then she saw half that many bees return in the next 6 hours, which is 15 bees. After that, she saw twice as many bees leave as the first time, so that's 60 bees. By the end of the first 12 hours, there were 15 bees that left but didn't come back yet.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours came back. So, in the last 6 hours, 60 bees came back to the hive.

The number of bees that came back in the last 6 hours is 60."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Brittany and her mom went to the museum. The museum charges $12 for an adult and $10 for a child. So, for one adult and one child, it would cost $12 + $10 = $22.

Brittany's mom got $8 in change after paying for the tickets. This means she gave the cashier more money than the tickets cost. So, to find out how much she gave, we add the cost of the tickets to the change she got back: $22 + $8 = $30.

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, and he has three times as many friends as Dorothy. So, if we divide Charlie's friends by 3, we get Dorothy's friends. That means Dorothy has 4 friends. Now, James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, we take Dorothy's 4 friends and multiply by 4 to find out how many friends James has. That gives us 16 friends. So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The answer is 16."
"Steve lives 3 miles away from school and he bikes at 440 feet per minute. First, we need to change the distance from miles to feet. Since 1 mile is 5280 feet, 3 miles is 3 times 5280, which equals 15840 feet. Now, to find out how long it takes Steve to bike 15840 feet at 440 feet per minute, we divide the distance by his speed: 15840 feet ÷ 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.

Tim lives 2 miles away from school, which is 2 times 5280 feet, so that's 10560 feet. Tim skates at 264 feet per minute, so to find out how long it takes him to skate 10560 feet, we divide the distance by his speed: 10560 feet ÷ 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

Steve takes 36 minutes to get home, but Tim takes 40 minutes. So, the difference in their times is 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes. This means Steve will be waiting 4 minutes before Tim finishes the race.

The answer is: 4 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Shawnda wants to charge 25 cents for each tire she inflates. On the first day, she had people come with different types of bikes and a unicycle.

First, she had 5 people with bicycles. Each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 bicycles times 2 tires each, which is 10 tires. At 25 cents per tire, that's 10 tires times 25 cents, which is 250 cents. In dollars, that's 2.5 dollars.

Then, she had 3 people with tricycles. Each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 tricycles times 3 tires each, which is 9 tires. At 25 cents per tire, that's 9 tires times 25 cents, which is 225 cents. In dollars, that's 2.25 dollars.

Finally, she had 1 person with a unicycle. A unicycle has 1 tire, so that's 1 tire times 25 cents, which is 25 cents. In dollars, that's 0.25 dollars.

Now, we add all these up: 2.5 dollars + 2.25 dollars + 0.25 dollars. That makes 4.99 dollars.

So, Shawnda made 4.99 dollars that day. The closest answer in the multiple-choice options would be 5 dollars.

The final answer is: **5 dollars**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies. So, he gets:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for all the cookies is:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times $0.10/\text{cookie} = $6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill, so the change he gets back is:
\[ $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00 \]

So, Carl gets $4.00 in change. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{4.00}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Dave ate 14 fries. Then a seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate 7 fries. That means Dave and the seagull together ate 14 + 7 = 21 fries. So, there were 21 fries left.

Then three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries. Now there were 21 - 9 = 12 fries left.

A raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries, so the raccoon ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 fries. That left 12 - 8 = 4 fries.

Ants then ate one more, leaving 4 - 1 = 3 fries. But the problem says there were 5 fries left, so that means the raccoon must have eaten 3 + 1 = 4 fries, not 8. This means the 4 fries left were the ones that were left after the raccoon ate.

So, if 4 fries were left after the raccoon ate, that means before the raccoon ate, there were 4 + 4 = 8 fries. But we know Dave and the seagull ate 21 fries, so the total must have been 21 + 8 = 29 fries.

But the problem says there were 5 fries left, so the total must have been 5 + 5 = 10 fries before the raccoon ate. That means the raccoon must have eaten 8 fries, not 4.

So, the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 10.

The answer is: **10**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Kimo has three classes each on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Each class is 1 hour long. So, on these days, he spends 3 hours each day. There are 3 such days in a week, so in one week, he spends \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours. Over 16 weeks, he spends \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours on these days.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, on these days, he spends 4 hours each day. There are 2 such days in a week, so in one week, he spends \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours. Over 16 weeks, he spends \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours on these days.

Now, to find out how many hours he spends in total, we add the hours from both types of days:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

So, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester. The answer is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Bill makes different kinds of baked goods and we need to find out how long they would be if we put them all end to end.

First, we know:
- He makes 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long.
- He makes 120 chocolate croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long.
- He makes 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is 24 inches long.

Now, let's add up all the lengths:
- Rolls: \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches
- Croissants: \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches
- Baguettes: \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches

So, the total length in inches is:
\[1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\] inches

Now, we need to convert inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:
\[3360 \div 12 = 280\] feet

So, if we put all the baked goods end to end, they would be 280 feet long. The answer is 280 feet."

The zookeeper has some monkeys, gorillas, and baboons. Each month, the monkeys eat 200 bananas, the gorillas eat 400 bananas, and the baboons eat 100 bananas.

Now, if we want to know how many bananas they need for 2 months, we can do this step by step:

1. For the monkeys, they eat 200 bananas each month. For 2 months, that's \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.
2. For the gorillas, they eat 400 bananas each month. For 2 months, that's \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.
3. For the baboons, they eat 100 bananas each month. For 2 months, that's \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, if we add all these up, we get:
\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}\]

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months. The answer is \(\boxed{1400}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. So, each time he runs 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). If he does this 15 times, he runs 3000 yards in total.

Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each time. She does this 34 times, so she runs 2720 yards in total.

Now, we need to find out how much farther Blake ran than Kelly. Blake ran 3000 yards and Kelly ran 2720 yards. So, Blake ran 280 yards more than Kelly.

The answer is 280 yards."
"Okay, let me break it down simply. Raphael bought 4 pens that cost $1.5 each, so that's 4 times $1.5, which is $6. He also bought 2 notebooks that cost $4 each, so that's 2 times $4, which is $8. And he got a roll of bond paper for $20. Now, if we add all these up: $6 for the pens, $8 for the notebooks, and $20 for the bond paper, we get $6 + $8 + $20 = $34. So, Raphael spent $34 in total."
"Initially, there were 11 tadpoles. Then, 6 more came out, so that's 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles. But then 2 went back under the rock, so we subtract those 2. That means 17 - 2 = 15 tadpoles. So, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now. 

The answer is 15."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water. On Tuesday, it got 7 more feet, so that's 17 + 7 = 24 feet of water. Now, on Wednesday, the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. So, we take two-thirds of 24 feet, which is 24 * (2/3) = 16 feet.

So, the water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet. The answer is 16 feet."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Anakin caught some starfish, sea horses, and clownfish at the beach. He caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. Locsin caught different numbers of these fish. Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so that's 10 - 5 = 5 starfish. Locsin also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so that's 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses. And Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so that's 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught together:
- Starfish: 10 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 15 starfish
- Sea horses: 6 (Anakin) + 3 (Locsin) = 9 sea horses
- Clownfish: 3 (Anakin) + 5 (Locsin) = 8 clownfish

So, the total number of fish they caught is 15 + 9 + 8 = 32 fish.

The total number of fish they caught is 32."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We start with a bag of marbles that costs $20. Every two months, the price goes up by 20% of what it was before. We want to know how much it will cost after 36 months.

First, let's see how much it goes up every two months. If it goes up by 20% of $20, that's $4 extra every two months.

Now, if we have 36 months, that's 36 divided by 2, which is 18. So, the price goes up 18 times.

If it goes up $4 each time, then after 18 times, it would be $4 times 18, which is $72.

So, if we add that $72 to the original $20, the new price would be $20 plus $72, which is $92.

So, the bag of marbles would cost $92 after 36 months."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have different toys in a room: 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and 1 doll. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and we know that one red car costs $4.

First, we find out how much one action figure costs. Since one red car costs $4 and it's the same as 3 action figures, we divide $4 by 3 to find the cost of one action figure. But the problem tells us that one action figure costs $5, not $1.33.

Now, we add up all the toys:
- The 5 red cars cost $4 each, so 5 cars cost $4 × 5 = $20.
- The 3 action figures cost $5 each, so 3 figures cost $5 × 3 = $15.
- The doll costs the same as 3 action figures, so the doll costs $5 × 3 = $15.

Adding these together, the total cost is $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.

So, the total value of all the toys is $50."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jackie can do her taxes herself and miss out on some money. If she does her taxes herself, she'll miss out on 3 hours of work, and she makes $35 for each hour she works. So, if she misses out on 3 hours, she'll miss out on:
\[ 3 \times 35 = 105 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, if she hires an accountant, it costs her $90. So, to find out how much less money she'll have, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the money she misses out on:
\[ 105 - 90 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant. The answer is that she will have $15 less. 

The correct answer is: **$15 less**"
"Elvira got a computer with different things for her birthday. She spent some money on a screen, keyboard, mouse, scanner, CD burner, and a printer. The screen cost €157, the keyboard and mouse together cost €74, the scanner cost €102, the CD burner cost €74, and the printer cost €102. She also has €1500 from her family to spend. 

First, let's add up all the things she bought:
- Screen: €157
- Keyboard and mouse: €74
- Scanner: €102
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add these amounts together:
€157 + €74 + €102 + €74 + €102 = €509

Elvira had €1500 to spend. To find out how much she has left for her clothes, we subtract the total cost of the things she bought from her budget:
€1500 - €509 = €991

So, Elvira will have €991 left for her clothes. The answer is €991."
"To make 15 Spanish flans, Sandra needs 3 eggs for each flan. So, she needs 3 eggs × 15 flans = 45 eggs in total. The neighbor gives her 9 eggs each time she babysits. To get 45 eggs, she needs 45 eggs ÷ 9 eggs per babysitting = 5 babysittings. So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times. The answer is 5."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is 8 years old, Seth would be 16 years old because 8 times 2 is 16.

Now, in two years, Brooke will be 8 + 2 = 10 years old, and Seth will be 16 + 2 = 18 years old. The sum of their ages in two years will be 10 + 18 = 28, which matches the question.

So, Seth is 16 years old. The answer is 16."
"Okay, let me think this through. Ethel has $8. Jimmy has $2 more than twice what Ethel has. So, we take what Ethel has, which is $8, and double that to get $16. Then we add $2 to $16, which gives us $18. So, Jimmy has $18. The answer is $18."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday. That's 5 days, so he walks 20 miles/day × 5 days = 100 miles during the weekdays.

On Saturday and Sunday, which are the weekend days, he walks 10 miles each day. So, for the weekend, he walks 10 miles/day × 2 days = 20 miles.

Now, if we add the miles he walks during the weekdays and the weekend, we get 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

So, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week. The answer is 120 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The marching band is buying uniforms, and each uniform comes with a hat, a jacket, and pants. 

First, the hat costs $25. 
Then, the jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so it's $25 times 3, which is $75.
The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, so we add the hat and jacket costs and then divide by 2. That's ($25 + $75) / 2, which equals $50.

So, to find the total cost of one uniform, we add the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants together: $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

So, each uniform costs $150 in total."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jake saw some spiders, insects, and a few special bugs. The spiders had 8 legs each, 80 of them. So, that's 80 times 8, which is 640 legs from the spiders.

Then there were insects. These insects had 6 legs each, and there were 90 of them. So, that's 90 times 6, which is 540 legs from the insects.

Lastly, there were 3 special bugs with 10 legs each. So, that's 3 times 10, which is 30 legs from the special bugs.

Now, if we add all these together: 640 legs from the spiders, 540 legs from the insects, and 30 legs from the special bugs, we get 640 plus 540 plus 30, which is 1210.

So, Jake saw a total of 1210 legs."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have four birds, and we know some ages:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 19 years old.

Now, we don't know how old the Caboose is, but we assume it's the same as Sally Thirtytwo and Sally Four, which is 8 years old.

So, we add up all their ages:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Caboose: 8 years

Adding these up: 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51

So, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Jessica has three debts: student loans, a credit card, and a mortgage. She needs to pay $300 for the student loans, $200 for the credit card, and $500 for the mortgage each month. That's a total of $1000 each month.

Now, she wants to pay a bit more than the minimum. She wants to pay 50% more than the $1000. To find out how much more, we calculate 50% of $1000, which is $500. So, she will pay $1000 plus $500, which is $1500 each month.

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply $1500 by 12 (because there are 12 months in a year). So, $1500 times 12 is $18000.

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year. The answer is $18000."
"Billy has 60 potatoes to peel and cut. It takes him 1.5 minutes to peel one potato and 5 seconds to cut one. To find out how long it will take him, we first figure out the time for one potato.

For one potato, it takes:
- 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds) to peel
- 5 seconds to cut

So, for one potato, it takes:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, for 60 potatoes, it will take:
\[ 60 \times 95 \text{ seconds} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

To convert 5700 seconds into minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes. The answer is 95 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Juan and Carlos sell lemonade. For each gallon, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar, so that's $5 total for each gallon. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses from each gallon. So, from each gallon, they make $10 because 20 glasses times $0.50 per glass equals $10.

They made $25 in profit. To find out how much they spent on lemons, we need to figure out how many gallons they sold. If they made $25 in profit and each gallon gives them $10 in sales, then they must have sold 2.5 gallons to make $25 in profit. But since they can't sell half a gallon, let's think about it this way: if they sold 2 gallons, they would make $20 in sales, and with the $5 cost per gallon, they would have a profit of $15. If they sold 3 gallons, they would make $30 in sales, and with the $15 cost, they would have a profit of $15. So, they must have sold 2.5 gallons, but since we can't sell half a gallon, let's assume they sold 2 gallons to make $20 in sales and spent $10 on lemons. That would give them a profit of $10, which is close to $25, but not exact. So, they must have sold 2.5 gallons to make $25 in profit, and they spent $15 on lemons.

So, the amount they spent on lemons is $15."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We had a race with 240 people. Out of them, 80 were Japanese. So, the rest, which are 160 people, were Chinese. Among these 160 Chinese people, 60 were boys. To find out how many girls there were, we take the total number of Chinese people and subtract the number of boys. So, 160 minus 60 equals 100. That means there were 100 girls on the Chinese team."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Zaid earns $6000 a month. He spends some of it on rent and car fuel. First, he spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $6000 / 4 = $1500. Then he spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is $6000 / 3 = $2000. So, after rent and car fuel, he has $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500 left.

Then he donates half of the remaining amount to charity, so he donates $2500 / 2 = $1250. Now he has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.

After that, he gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife. So, he gives away $200 + $700 = $900 in total. Now he has $1250 - $900 = $350 left.

So, the final amount of money Zaid will have left is $350."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have three friends: Bo, Monic, and Rani. Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 4 less than Bo, so Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs. Now, if we add up all the crabs they have together, it's 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs. So, the total number of crabs they have is 122."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Lloyd gets paid $10 for each hour he tutors. In the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so he got:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \]
dollars.

In the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so he got:
\[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \]
dollars.

Now, to find out how much he got in total for both weeks, we add the money from the first week and the second week together:
\[ 50 + 80 = 130 \]
dollars.

So, Lloyd earned a total of 130 dollars for the first two weeks."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 80 votes in total. The winner got 3/4 of these votes. So, we need to find out how many that is.

First, we calculate 3/4 of 80:
\[ 3/4 \times 80 = 60 \]
So, the winner got 60 votes.

Now, to find out how many votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:
\[ 80 - 60 = 20 \]

So, the loser got 20 votes. The answer is 20."
"Oh, hello there! Let me help you with this. So, Sandra ordered some flowers, and she's a bit upset because Fred didn't deliver them on time. She ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, and she also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Now, if we figure out how many white carnations she ordered, we can find out how many red roses she wanted. If 200 pink calla lilies are five times the number of white carnations, then we can divide 200 by 5 to find out how many white carnations there are. So, 200 divided by 5 is 40. That means Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we multiply 40 by 4 to find out how many red roses she wanted. So, 40 times 4 is 160. That means Sandra wanted 160 red roses.

So, Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to make Sandra happy. The answer is 160."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without the previous steps.

We know Jan is 30 years old. Two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. At that time, Mark was 5 years younger than half of Jan's age, so Mark was \(28 / 2 - 5 = 14 - 5 = 9\) years old two years ago. So, Mark's current age is \(9 + 2 = 11\) years old.

Jean is two years older than Mark, so Jean is \(11 + 2 = 13\) years old.

The answer is 13."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have two teams running a race where each team has four runners, and each runner runs 400 meters. One team is really good and all their runners finish in 55 seconds. The other team is not as good, and their first runner takes 60 seconds, but each next runner is 3 seconds faster than the last.

For the first team, since all four runners finish in 55 seconds, the total time is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} + 55 \text{ seconds} + 55 \text{ seconds} + 55 \text{ seconds} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

For the second team, their times are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

So, the total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how much faster the first team is, we subtract the total time of the first team from the total time of the second team:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the first team wins by 2 seconds. The answer is 2 seconds."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jerry is rolling a six-sided die. We want to know how much more likely it is for him to roll a number bigger than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

First, we look at the numbers bigger than 3. They are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 numbers out of 6 that are bigger than 3. That means the chance of rolling a number bigger than 3 is 3 out of 6, which simplifies to 1 out of 2 or 50%.

Next, we look at rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6. The chance of rolling an even number is 3 out of 6, which simplifies to 1 out of 2 or 50%. But we need to roll two even numbers in a row, so we multiply the chances: 50% times 50%, which is 25%.

Now, we want to know how much more likely it is to roll a number bigger than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. If we have a 50% chance of rolling a number bigger than 3 and a 25% chance of rolling two even numbers in a row, we can see that 50% is 25% more than 25%.

So, the answer is that it's 25% more likely to roll a number bigger than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. The answer in multiple-choice format would be:

A) 25%"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many as her mom, so she picked 10 apples. If we add the apples they both picked, it's 20 plus 10, which makes 30 apples in total. So, the total number of apples they picked together is 30."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 160 pieces of straw to give to the rodents. We know that 50 pieces go to the hamsters and 20 pieces go to the rabbits. So, we subtract those from the total to find out how many pieces go to the rats: 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces. Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we divide the 90 pieces by 6 to find out how many rats we have: 90 ÷ 6 = 15 rats. Now, we have 3 cages for the rats, so we divide the 15 rats by 3 to find out how many rats are in each cage: 15 ÷ 3 = 5 rats. So, there are 5 rats in each cage. The answer is 5."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mandy owes Benedict $100 and they agreed to have a 2% interest each month. After 3 months, we need to know how much Mandy should give back.

First, let's find out how much interest Mandy has to pay for each month. If the interest is 2% of $100, then:
\[ 2\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.02 \times 100 = 2 \]
So, for each month, Mandy has to pay $2 in interest.

Now, if we add this interest for 3 months:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
So, the total interest for 3 months is $6.

To find out the total amount Mandy should give back, we add the interest to the original amount:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict $106.

The correct answer is **$106**."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The trader buys wheat at $20 per bag and spends $2 to transport each bag. So, for each bag, the total cost is $22. He sells each bag for $30 and made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags.

To find out how many bags he sold, we can use the information that the profit is the selling price minus the cost price. So, for each bag, the profit is $30 - $22 = $8. If the total profit is $400, we can find out how many bags he sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag. 

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per bag}} = \frac{400}{8} = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The answer is 50."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

They bought tickets for $20.25 and food for $15.75. So, the total for tickets and food is $20.25 + $15.75 = $36.00.

Then they went on 2 rides, each costing $33. So, the rides cost $33 x 2 = $66.00.

Now, if we add the cost of the tickets, food, and rides together, we get $36.00 + $66.00 = $102.00.

Since there are 3 friends, they split the $102.00 evenly. So, each friend pays $102.00 ÷ 3 = $34.00.

So, each person paid $34.00."
"John collects peaches for 3 hours, and he can collect 2 peaches every minute. To find out how many peaches he collects, we first need to know how many minutes are in 3 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 3 hours, there are \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes. Since he collects 2 peaches every minute, in 180 minutes he collects \(180 \times 2 = 360\) peaches.

So, the number of peaches John collects is 360. The correct answer is 360."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We know ducks need 3.5 pounds of insects each week to survive. There are 10 ducks in the flock. First, we need to find out how much each duck eats in a week. We do this by dividing 3.5 pounds by 10 ducks, which gives us 0.35 pounds of insects each week for one duck.

Now, since there are 7 days in a week, we need to find out how much each duck eats in one day. We do this by dividing 0.35 pounds by 7 days, which gives us 0.05 pounds of insects each day for one duck.

Since we have 10 ducks, we multiply 0.05 pounds by 10 ducks to find out how much the whole flock eats in one day. So, 0.05 times 10 is 0.5 pounds.

Therefore, the flock of ten ducks needs 0.5 pounds of insects each day. 

The answer is: **0.5 pounds**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tom starts with 50 trees. Every year, he adds 10 trees by planting and takes away 2 trees by chopping down. So, every year he adds 8 trees to his total. Over 10 years, he adds \(10 \times 8 = 80\) trees. So, after 10 years, he would have \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.

But then, 30% of these trees die. To find out how many trees die, we calculate 30% of 130, which is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.

So, after the trees die, he's left with \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

The final number of trees Tom has left is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

On Friday, Sue had 18 pink flamingos in her yard. On Saturday, the neighbors took 6 of those flamingos and painted them white and put them back. So, Sue had 12 pink flamingos left. Then on Sunday, they put 18 more pink flamingos in the yard. So now Sue has 12 pink flamingos plus 18 pink flamingos, which makes 30 pink flamingos.

On Sunday, they also put 6 white flamingos in the yard. So now Sue has 6 white flamingos.

To find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white ones, we do 30 (pink) minus 6 (white), which gives us 24.

So, there are 24 more pink flamingos than white ones. The answer is 24."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Violetta wants to buy crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. She has $20 to spend. 

To find out how much she spends on crayons, we multiply the number of crayons by the cost of each crayon:
\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much change she gets, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the money she has:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Violetta will get $10 in change."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. A pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. So, if you add those two together, you get $1.50. That's how much one pen costs.

Now, if I want to know how much 8 pens would cost, I just multiply $1.50 by 8. 

$1.50 times 8 is $12.00.

So, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 200 pounds of carrots and we need to give them to 40 restaurants. Each restaurant gets 2 pounds. So, we do 40 times 2 to find out how many pounds we give away in total. 

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we started with 200 pounds and gave away 80 pounds, so we do:

\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used. The answer is 120 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We know there are 23,786 people in the city of Soda. Out of these, 8,417 are men and 9,092 are women. To find out how many kids there are, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total number of people.

So, we do 23,786 minus 8,417 for the men and then we do that number minus 9,092 for the women. 

First, we do 23,786 minus 8,417, which gives us 15,369. Then we take 15,369 and subtract 9,092 from it, which gives us 6,277.

So, there are 6,277 kids in the city of Soda."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards. In the first month, she got three times that, so that's 3 times 20, which is 60 cards. In the second month, she got 20 cards less than the first month, so that's 60 minus 20, which is 40 cards. In the third month, she got twice the total of the first and second months, so that's 2 times (60 plus 40), which is 2 times 100, so 200 cards.

Now, if we add all the cards together: 20 (initial) + 60 (first month) + 40 (second month) + 200 (third month) = 320 cards.

So, Elaine has 320 Pokemon cards now."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Mark edits 1000 sentences a week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents for each sentence, so that's 5000 cents from Publisher A. Publisher B pays him twice as much, so that's 10 cents for each sentence, which makes 10000 cents from Publisher B. If we add the money from both publishers, we get 5000 cents + 10000 cents = 15000 cents. So, Mark makes 15000 cents in a week."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Baldur gets water from a well. He gets 5 big buckets of water in the morning and 6 big buckets in the afternoon. Each big bucket holds 5 liters of water. We want to know how many liters of water he gets in a day.

First, we add up all the buckets he gets:
- In the morning, he gets 5 buckets.
- In the afternoon, he gets 6 buckets.
So, he gets 5 + 6 = 11 buckets in a day.

Now, each bucket holds 5 liters, so we multiply the number of buckets by the liters each bucket holds:
- 11 buckets × 5 liters per bucket = 55 liters.

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day. The answer is 55 liters."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John got a big prize at work. He got $5000 right away and also got a raise. His old pay was $2000 a week. Now he gets $2100 a week because of the raise.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so if he gets $2100 each week, that's:
\[ 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

But he also got $5000 right at the start of the year, so we add that to his yearly earnings:
\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, John made $114200 that year. The answer is $114200."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Josie has a farm that's 10 acres big. Each acre can grow 5 tons of grapes every year. So, if we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes per acre, we get the total tons of grapes: 10 acres times 5 tons per acre equals 50 tons of grapes.

Now, each ton of grapes can be turned into 2 barrels of wine. So, if we take the total tons of grapes and multiply that by 2 barrels per ton, we get the total barrels of wine: 50 tons times 2 barrels per ton equals 100 barrels of wine.

So, Josie's farm can make 100 barrels of wine every year. The answer is 100 barrels."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Carl ate sandwiches every day for 5 days, and he used 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich. So, for sandwiches, he used 2 slices/day × 5 days = 10 slices of cheese.

For breakfast, he ate omelets 3 days, and he used 1 more slice than he did for the sandwiches. Since he used 2 slices for sandwiches, he used 2 slices + 1 slice = 3 slices for each omelet. So, for omelets, he used 3 slices/day × 3 days = 9 slices of cheese.

He also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese for that.

Now, if we add all the cheese slices together, we get 10 slices (sandwiches) + 9 slices (omelets) + 8 slices (macaroni and cheese) = 27 slices of cheese.

So, the total number of cheese slices Carl used is 27."

Janet started with 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. That's a total of 32 pens.

Then she got some more pens. She got 6 bags of blue pens, and each bag had 9 pens. So, she got 6 times 9 pens, which is 54 blue pens.

She also got 2 bags of red pens, and each bag had 6 pens. So, she got 2 times 6 pens, which is 12 red pens.

Now, let's add all the pens together: 22 green pens + 10 yellow pens + 54 blue pens + 12 red pens.

22 + 10 = 32
32 + 54 = 86
86 + 12 = 98

So, Janet has 98 pens now. The answer is 98."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Bert gives six tests, and he lets you pick the best five out of six. Brinley already has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on her first five tests. She wants to know what score she needs on her sixth test to have an average of 93.

First, we add up the scores of the first five tests:
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440

To have an average of 93 after six tests, the total score needs to be:
93 × 6 = 558

So, Brinley needs the sixth test score to make the total 558. We already have 440 from the first five tests, so:
558 - 440 = 118

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 118 on her sixth test to have an average of 93.

The answer is: 118"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Micheal used to ride his bike 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time. So, in one week, he rode 5 times 25, which is 125 kilometers. He did this for 4 weeks, so that's 4 times 125, which is 500 kilometers.

Then, he decided to ride his bike 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time. So, in one week, he rode 2 times 60, which is 120 kilometers. He did this for 3 weeks, so that's 3 times 120, which is 360 kilometers.

Now, if we add the kilometers from the first 4 weeks and the next 3 weeks, we get 500 kilometers plus 360 kilometers, which is 860 kilometers.

So, Micheal rode his bike a total of 860 kilometers."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Joe has a bag of candy. In that bag, he has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar is 40 grams, and each candied apple is half the weight of a chocolate bar because it's said to be half as heavy.

First, I figure out how much the chocolate bars weigh. If each chocolate bar is 40 grams, and he has 25 of them, I multiply 40 by 25. That gives me 1000 grams for all the chocolate bars.

Next, I look at the candied apples. Each one is half the weight of a chocolate bar, so that's 20 grams each. If he has 80 of them, I multiply 20 by 80. That gives me 1600 grams for all the candied apples.

Now, I add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples together. 1000 grams plus 1600 grams equals 2600 grams.

So, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."
"Oh, okay. Let me break this down for you step by step.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes. That's easy to remember.

On Tuesday, she went to a different store and bought three times the number of cakes she did on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.

On Wednesday, she went to another store and bought five times the number of cakes she did on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, to find out how many cakes she bought in total, we add up all the cakes she bought each day:
\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, Rose bought 76 cakes in total. The answer is 76."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have half a dozen plates that cost $6000 each. So, for half a dozen plates, it costs $36000.

Now, we're told that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than that. So, if we take $36000 and subtract $1200, we get $34800. This $34800 is the cost for twenty dozen cups.

Since twenty dozen cups is 240 cups, we need to find out how much one cup costs. To do this, we divide $34800 by 240.

$34800 ÷ 240 = $145.

So, each cup costs $145. The answer is $145."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Sara wants to buy a jacket that costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes, each costing $20. So, the shoes cost $20 times 2, which is $40. Adding the jacket and the shoes together, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Sara already has $10 saved. So, she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more.

She earns $5 each time she babysits and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 times 4, which is $20 from babysitting. She still needs $60 - $20 = $40 more.

Now, she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To get $40, she needs to mow the lawn $40 divided by $4, which is 10 times.

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to have enough money. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jerry has a bunch of chickens. The red ones lay 3 eggs each day, and the white ones lay 5 eggs each day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. He has two more white chickens than red chickens. We need to find out how many red chickens he has.

Let's think about it. If we say the number of red chickens is \( r \), then the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \) because he has two more white chickens.

Now, the red chickens give 3 eggs each day, so \( r \) red chickens give \( 3r \) eggs. The white chickens give 5 eggs each day, so \( r + 2 \) white chickens give \( 5(r + 2) \) eggs. All together, they give 42 eggs a day, so we have:

\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Let's solve this:

\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. That's my answer."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The park is a rectangle that's 6 miles long and 1.5 miles wide. To walk all around it, you have to walk the length twice and the width twice. So, you walk 6 miles + 6 miles = 12 miles for the length and 1.5 miles + 1.5 miles = 3 miles for the width. That makes 12 miles + 3 miles = 15 miles total.

Gary walks at 3 miles an hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, you divide the total miles by his speed. So, 15 miles ÷ 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

On the first day, Sloane saw 100 people in the store. The next day, she saw 50 more people than the first day, so that's 100 plus 50, which is 150 people. Now, we know that by the end of the third day, there were 500 people in total.

To find out how many people came on the third day, we take the total number of people (500) and subtract the number of people from the first and second days. So, we do 500 minus the 100 from the first day and the 150 from the second day. That gives us 500 minus 250, which is 250.

So, on the third day, Sloane counted 250 people. The answer is 250."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Imagine the small pool had 8 gallons of water. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so it had 16 gallons. But since both pools were losing water at 4 gallons a minute for 4 minutes, they both lost 16 gallons. So, the big pool now has 16 - 16 = 0 gallons, and the small pool still has 8 gallons. That's how much water the small pool has now."
"To figure out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first add up the cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320 and the belt costs $32, so together they cost $320 + $32 = $352.

Now, we know Lori earns $8.00 for each hour she works. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352, we divide $352 by $8.00. So, $352 ÷ $8.00 = 44 hours.

Therefore, Lori needs to work 44 hours to buy the shoes and the belt. The answer is 44 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to give back a bit more. She said she would give back 10% more than what she borrowed. So, 10% of $2000 is $200. That means she promised to give back $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Now, she's going to pay $165 every month for 12 months. So, if she pays $165 each month, over 12 months she'll pay $165 * 12 = $1980.

But she promised to give back $2200, and she'll have paid $1980. So, her remaining balance will be $2200 - $1980 = $220.

So, the answer is $220."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We start with 4 roses. The problem says there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, if we add 7 to the 4 roses, we get 11 dahlias.

Now, to find out how many flowers there are in total, we add the roses and dahlias together. So, 4 roses plus 11 dahlias equals 15 flowers.

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Harriet is 21 years old now. If we add 3 years to her age, she'll be 24 years old in three years.

Zack is twice as old as Harriet, so if Harriet is 21, Zack is 42 years old now. In three years, Zack will be 45 years old.

Adrian is three times as old as Harriet, so if Harriet is 21, Adrian is 63 years old now. In three years, Adrian will be 66 years old.

Now, to find the average age of the three in three years, we add their ages together and then divide by 3.

So, we add 24 (Harriet's age in 3 years) + 45 (Zack's age in 3 years) + 66 (Adrian's age in 3 years) which gives us 135. Then we divide 135 by 3 to get the average.

135 divided by 3 is 45.

So, the average age of the three in three years will be 45."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. We have four students and they scored a total of 251 points. Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half of what Naomi scored, so Yuri got 44 points. Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi, so she got 85 points. Now, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to subtract the points of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points. So, 251 minus 68 (Naomi's score) minus 44 (Yuri's score) minus 85 (Brianna's score) equals 54. Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points. The answer is 54."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Carmen does crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles. She does 3 crossword puzzles, and each takes 10 minutes. So, for crossword puzzles, she spends 3 times 10 minutes, which is 30 minutes. Now, she also does 8 sudoku puzzles, and each takes 5 minutes. So, for sudoku puzzles, she spends 8 times 5 minutes, which is 40 minutes. To find out how much time she spent in total, we add the time for crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles together. So, 30 minutes plus 40 minutes equals 70 minutes. Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games. The answer is 70 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We start with 120 liters of water in the tank. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden, so we have 30 liters left. Then she collects twice as much water as what's left, which is 60 liters. So, we add the 60 liters she collected to the 30 liters that were left. That makes a total of 90 liters. So, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters. 

The answer is: 90 liters."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Andy plants 90 geraniums and 40 fewer petunias than that, so he plants 50 petunias. To find out how many flowers he plants in total, we add the geraniums and petunias together. So, 90 geraniums plus 50 petunias equals 140 flowers. So, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

In the first year, the company spent $15000 on ads. In the second year, they spent a third of that, which is $5000. So, if we add the two amounts together, we get:

$15000 + $5000 = $20000

So, the total amount the company spent on ads over the two years is $20000."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without all the big words.

Carlos rented a canoe for $30 an hour and he used it for 3 hours. So, he paid:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \, \text{dollars} \]

Benji rented a banana boat raft for $18 an hour and he used it for 5 hours. So, he paid:
\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much they paid altogether, we add what Carlos paid to what Benji paid:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, they paid a total of 180 dollars. The answer is 180."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Andrew wants to go to Rochester and come back. He takes 6 days to go to Rochester by bus. The trip back by car takes half as long, so that's 3 days. So, the total time he spends traveling is 6 days to Rochester plus 3 days back, which makes 9 days in total.

So, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 9 days.

The answer is 9 days."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James starts with 30 fire cards, 20 grass cards, and 40 water cards. He loses 8 water cards and gets 14 more grass cards. So, he now has:

- 30 fire cards
- 20 + 14 = 34 grass cards
- 40 - 8 = 32 water cards

Now, he has a total of 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards.

To find out what percentage of his cards are water type, we do this:

\[ \frac{32}{96} \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounded to the nearest whole number, it's 33%.

So, the chance that a card picked at random is a water card is 33%. 

The answer is: **33**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Chad's burrito starts at $6.50. He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and two sauces at $0.25 each. So, that's $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.25 + $0.25 = $11.00.

Then he decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, which means the total cost becomes $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

But Chad has a gift card worth $5.00, so he uses that to pay. So, $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

So, Chad still owes $9.00."
"Oh, okay. So Kalinda can put 4 pieces in a minute, and her mom can put half as many, which is 2 pieces a minute. Together, they can put 4 plus 2, which is 6 pieces in a minute. Now, the puzzle has 360 pieces, so to find out how long it will take them to put all the pieces together, we divide the total pieces by the number of pieces they can put together in a minute. So, 360 pieces divided by 6 pieces per minute equals 60 minutes. Now, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 minutes is the same as 1 hour. So, it will take them 1 hour to finish the puzzle. The answer is 1 hour."
"Okay, let me explain it like I understand it better.

The farm made 120 watermelons. After two months, 30% of them were ready to be picked. So, 30% of 120 is 36 watermelons. That means 36 watermelons were picked.

Now, if 36 were picked, that leaves 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready to be picked. So, 3/4 of 84 is 63 watermelons. That means 63 watermelons were picked again.

So, the number of watermelons left that weren't picked yet is 84 - 63 = 21.

So, the number of watermelons that weren't ready to be picked after two weeks is 21."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. So, the total cost for all the cars is 12 times $20,000, which is $240,000. Now, he has to pay 10% tax on this total cost. So, 10% of $240,000 is $24,000. Adding the tax to the total cost of the cars gives us $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000. After that, he has to pay $1,000 for registration on each car, and since he has 12 cars, the total registration cost is $1,000 times 12, which is $12,000. Adding the registration cost to the total cost of the cars and tax gives us $264,000 + $12,000 = $276,000. So, Mark pays $276,000 in total. The answer is $276,000."
"Oh, okay. So, let me break it down for you. On Monday, Robert collected 20 shells, and Kylie collected 5 more than that, so she collected 25 shells. On Tuesday, Kylie collected twice as many as she did on Monday, which means she collected 2 times 25, so that's 50 shells. So, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Dax found 50 ants in the garden. Now, he found half as many bugs as ants. So, if he found half as many bugs as ants, that means he found 50 / 2 = 25 bugs.

Now, to find out how many insects there are in total, we add the ants and the bugs together. So, 50 ants + 25 bugs = 75 insects.

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We start with 36 penguins. One-third of them, which is 12, go to swim in the ocean. Then another 12 go into the cave to eat. So, 12 penguins are gone because they went to swim or eat.

Now, if we take away the 12 that went to swim and the 12 that went to eat, we have 36 minus 24, which is 12 penguins left.

So, the number of penguins still sunbathing is 12."
"Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day, and his girlfriend eats half of that, so she eats 3 tomatoes a day. Together, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes a day. That means they eat 9 tomatoes times 7 days in a week, which is 63 tomatoes a week. If one vine gives 3 tomatoes a week, then to get 63 tomatoes, Steve needs 63 divided by 3, which is 21 vines. So, Steve needs 21 vines. The answer is 21."
"John wants to share pizzas with his 20 friends, and he wants each friend to have 4 slices. So, he needs 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices in total. Each pizza is cut into 8 slices. To find out how many pizzas he needs, we divide the total slices by the slices per pizza: 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas. So, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ram buys 25 pens. He can make a new pen by mixing the ink from 5 empty pens. So, if he has 25 pens, he can make 25 divided by 5, which is 5 new pens.

So, he starts with 25 pens and makes 5 more pens. That means he ends up with 25 original pens plus the 5 new ones he made, which is 30 pens in total.

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is 30."
"Johnny started with $20 and added $10 more, so he had $20 + $10 = $30. He put this money into an investment and it tripled. So, he had $30 * 3 = $90 after a year. 

The answer is $90."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easier to understand.

We have three girls: Jessa, Joan, and Mary. Jessa is 20 years old. Joan is older than Jessa by 5 years, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old. Mary is younger than Joan by 2 years, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Now, to find out the total age of all three girls, we add their ages together: 20 (Jessa) + 25 (Joan) + 23 (Mary) = 68.

So, the sum of their ages is 68."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We start with 1000 students in the hall. 

First, 30% of them go out through exit A. That means:
\[ 300 \text{ students went out through A.} \]

So, after exit A, we have:
\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \text{ students left.} \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students go out through exit B. So:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \text{ students went out through B.} \]

Now, the rest of the students go out through exit C. So:
\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \text{ students went out through C.} \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know John has 54 candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can find out how many candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2. So, Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.

Now, James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has. So, 54 - 33 = 21.

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

The answer is: **21**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Dolly has two books, and Pandora has one book. Now, Dolly reads both her own books and Pandora's book. That's 2 + 1 = 3 books. Pandora reads her own book and Dolly's books, so that's 1 + 2 = 3 books too. So, together they read 3 + 3 = 6 books. 

So, the total number of books they read is 6."
"Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he's left with 3 pen pals. Each of these pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. That means each pen pal sends 10 pages a week. Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is 30 pages. Mike writes back to each of them, so he writes 30 pages a week too. He can write a page in 6 minutes, so for 30 pages, it takes him 180 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 180 minutes is 3 hours. So, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week. The answer is 3 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. Jason has a phone plan that lets him use 1000 minutes a month. He makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day, and he's used 300 extra minutes for other calls. There are 30 days in the month.

First, we calculate how many minutes he uses for his boss's calls. Since he calls his boss every day for 15 minutes, over 30 days that's:
\[ 15 \times 30 = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add the extra minutes he used for other calls:
\[ 450 + 300 = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes he used from his plan's total allowance:
\[ 1000 - 750 = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left. The answer is 250."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Griffin started with 24 fries. Kyle took 5, so Griffin had 19 fries left. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so he took 10 fries. Now Griffin had 9 fries left. Colby took 2 fries. So, after Colby took his fries, Griffin had 7 fries left. But Griffin ended up with 27 fries. That means Ginger must have given Griffin 20 more fries because 7 plus 20 equals 27.

So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 20."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have two aquariums. In one, there are 4 snails, and in the other, there are 32 snails. The difference in the number of snails between these two aquariums is 28. The problem says that this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So, if we let the number of fish in each aquarium be \( F \), then the difference in snails (28) is twice \( 2F \) (because there are two aquariums). So, we have:

\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]
\[ F = 28 / 4 \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium. The answer is 7 fish."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The makeup artist charges $250 for each hour she works. She needs to do makeup for 4 days a week, and each day takes 6 hours. So, she works 24 hours a week. The movie lasts 5 weeks, so she works for 24 hours a week for 5 weeks, which is 120 hours in total.

Now, if she charges $250 for each hour, for 120 hours, she would charge:
\[ 120 \times 250 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

But she gives a 10% discount because she worked so much. A 10% discount on $30,000 is:
\[ 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after giving the discount, she charges:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Jean pays:
\[ \boxed{27000} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Isabelle bought all sorts of things for her sister's birthday party. She spent $12 on cake stuff, $43 on presents, $15 on decorations, $4 on invitations, and $22 on goodie bags. That's a lot of money, isn't it?

Now, she shared all that with her two parents. So, she had to split the total cost among three people. To find out how much each person paid, we add up all the money she spent and then divide it by 3.

First, let's add up all the money:
$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

Now, we divide $96 by 3:
$96 ÷ 3 = $32

So, each person paid $32. That's how much each of her parents paid."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag is 50 pounds. So, the total weight of onions is 200 pounds. Now, if one pound of onions costs $1.50, then for 200 pounds, the cost would be 200 times $1.50. 

So, 200 times $1.50 equals $300. 

Therefore, the chef spent $300. 

The answer is: **$300**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day. On Monday, she ate 5 cookies, and on Tuesday, she ate 13 cookies. So, we add those up to find out how many cookies her sister ate in total:
\[ 5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we know Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, so:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies} \]
And on Tuesday, she ate twice as many as her sister, so:
\[ 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies} \]
Adding those up for Sue:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, we calculate the total calories for each:
- Sue's total calories:
\[ 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \]
- Her sister's total calories:
\[ 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \]

To find out how many more calories Sue ate than her sister, we subtract:
\[ 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

So, Sue ate 5600 more calories than her sister. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have a school with 3 classes, and each class has 20 students. So, the school has 60 students in total. The school has an equal number of boys and girls, so there are 30 boys and 30 girls.

The first class has 15 girls, so the number of boys in the first class is 20 - 15 = 5 boys.

The second class has 12 girls, so the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8 boys.

Now, we need to find out how many boys are in the third class. We know the total number of boys in the school is 30. So, if we add the boys from the first and second classes, we get 5 + 8 = 13 boys.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we subtract the number of boys from the first and second classes from the total number of boys in the school:
30 (total boys) - 13 (boys from first and second classes) = 17 boys.

So, there are 17 boys in the third class. The answer is 17."
"Travis started with 61 apps. He got rid of 9 apps he didn't use, so he had:

\[ 61 - 9 = 52 \]

Then, he added 18 more apps, so he had:

\[ 52 + 18 = 70 \]

So, now Travis has 70 apps on his tablet. The answer is 70."
"Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, that's 10 + 15 = 25 animals. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, which means he killed 3 times the number of cougars he killed last night. Since he killed 15 cougars last night, today he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves. He also killed 3 fewer cougars than last night, so he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars today. So, today he killed 45 wolves and 12 cougars, which is 45 + 12 = 57 animals. In total, he killed 25 + 57 = 82 animals. 

The total number of animals Rick killed is 82. 

So, the answer is 82."
"Okay, let me think this through. Bill starts on the 3rd floor. He goes up to a floor that's 4 times where he started plus 6. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then we add 6 more floors. That makes it 12 plus 6, which is 18. So, Bill ends up on the 18th floor. The answer is 18."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mitchell went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down less, 30% less. So, 30% of 30 is 9. That means Anne went down 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne did. So, if Anne went down 21 times, Robert went down 4 times 21, which is 84 times.

So, Robert went down the slide 84 times. The answer is 84."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, that's 200 cows in total. Then, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. Now, there are 240 cows in total.

He splits these 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets 2 cows. That means each stall now has 2 cows.

Now, we want to know how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, 8 stalls would have:

2 cows/stall × 8 stalls = 16 cows

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 16. The answer is 16."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Brady has different kinds of money in his piggy bank. He has 100 pennies, 40 nickels, 20 dimes, and 40 dollar bills.

First, let's see how much the pennies are worth. A penny is worth a dime, which is $0.10. So, 100 pennies are worth $1.00.

Next, the nickels. A nickel is worth $0.05. So, 40 nickels are worth $2.00.

Then, the dimes. A dime is worth $0.10. So, 20 dimes are worth $2.00.

Lastly, the dollar bills. Each dollar bill is worth $1.00. So, 40 dollar bills are worth $40.00.

Now, we add all these up: $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00.

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have a big redwood tree that's 200 feet tall. Each 10-foot section of the tree weighs 400 pounds. So, to find out how many sections there are, we divide the total height by the length of each section: 200 feet / 10 feet/section = 20 sections.

Now, if each section weighs 400 pounds, then the whole tree weighs 20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds.

But termites ate some of the tree. They ate 30% of it, so 70% of the tree is still there. To find out how much is left, we calculate 70% of 8000 pounds: 8000 pounds * 0.70 = 5600 pounds.

So, the tree now weighs 5600 pounds. The answer is 5600 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Nancy has 8 books that are overdue. For each book, she owes 50 cents. So, for 8 books, she owes 8 times 50 cents. That's 4 dollars. Then, she also has to pay a flat fee of 2 dollars because she had at least one book overdue for more than a week.

So, 4 dollars plus 2 dollars is 6 dollars. That's how much Nancy has to pay in total.

The answer is: **6.00**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know Andrea has 52 apples. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so if Andrea has 44 apples, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. Andrea also has half as many bananas as Jamal, which is true because Jamal has 48 bananas, and half of that is 24, which matches Andrea's bananas. Jamal has 48 bananas. Now, to find out how many fruits they have together, we add Andrea's apples and bananas to Jamal's apples and bananas. Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, so that's 52 + 24 = 76 fruits. Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, so that's 44 + 48 = 92 fruits. Adding Andrea's and Jamal's fruits together, we get 76 + 92 = 168 fruits. So, the total number of fruits is 168."
"Oh, okay. So, Carla wants to make cookies. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, which makes 66 cookies in total. Now, to make a dozen cookies, she needs 2 cups of flour. A dozen is 12 cookies, so for 66 cookies, we need to figure out how many dozens that is.

If 12 cookies need 2 cups of flour, then 66 cookies would need:
\[ \frac{66}{12} \times 2 = 5.5 \times 2 = 11 \text{ cups of flour} \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake all the cookies. The answer is 11 cups."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 9,300 pennies in a cup. Now, we want to know how much money we get if we take two-thirds of those pennies. 

First, we need to find out how many pennies that is. We do that by taking 9,300 and multiplying it by 2/3. 

So, 9,300 times 2 is 18,600, and then we divide that by 3. 

18,600 divided by 3 is 6,200. So, we have 6,200 pennies in our stack.

Now, we know that 100 pennies make a dollar. So, to find out how many dollars we have, we divide 6,200 by 100.

6,200 divided by 100 is 62.

So, the total dollar amount in the stack is 62 dollars.

The answer is: **62**"
"Maddison starts with 5 boxes of marbles, and each box has 50 marbles. So, she has 5 times 50 marbles, which is 250 marbles. Then she gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So, she adds those 20 marbles to her 250 marbles. That makes 250 plus 20, which is 270 marbles in total. So, Maddison has 270 marbles now. 

The final answer is 270."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Chris has 6 trees in his yard. Ferdinand has half as many trees as Chris, so Ferdinand has 6 divided by 2, which is 3 trees. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has. Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has is 3 times 2, which is 6. Adding 5 to that gives us 6 plus 5, which is 11 trees. So, Harry has 11 trees, and Ferdinand has 3 trees. To find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number Harry has, which is 11 minus 3, giving us 8 trees. So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Carmen has $100. Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so she has $100 + $25 = $125. Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so she has $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, to find out how much all three have together, we add up what they each have:
$100 + $125 + $175 = $400.

So, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is $400."
"Mrs. Cruz wants to buy a house that costs $350,000. She has to pay a 5% brokerage fee and a 12% transfer fee. First, let's find out how much the fees are.

The brokerage fee is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

The transfer fee is:
\[ 12\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price:
\[ 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget. The answer is:
\[ 9,500 \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way without all the big words.

Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. He had to pay some money for the house transfer and for the people who helped sell it. He paid 3% of $400,000 for the transfer, which is $12,000. He also paid 5% of $400,000 for the people who helped sell it, which is $20,000. So, the total money he paid for these things is $12,000 + $20,000 = $32,000.

After paying these fees, he got $400,000 - $32,000 = $368,000. But he still had to pay $250,000 to finish paying off the house. So, the money he kept after paying off the house is $368,000 - $250,000 = $118,000.

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easier to understand.

First, we need to heat the oil to 300 degrees. That takes 20 minutes.

Next, we need to heat it to 400 degrees. It takes a bit longer, 40% more time than the first 20 minutes. So, 40% of 20 minutes is 8 minutes. Adding that to the 20 minutes, we get 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

After that, we cook the chicken. It takes 5 minutes less than the time it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees. So, 28 minutes minus 5 minutes is 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Now, we add all these times together: 20 minutes (heating to 300 degrees) + 28 minutes (heating to 400 degrees) + 23 minutes (cooking) = 71 minutes.

So, the total time from starting to cook the chicken until it's done is 71 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. The real estate agent bought newspaper ads and TV ads. For each newspaper ad, he spent $5, and he bought 50 of them. So, 5 times 50 is 250. That's how much he spent on newspaper ads.

For the TV ads, each one costs $75, and he bought 15 of them. So, 75 times 15 is 1125. That's how much he spent on TV ads.

Now, to find out how much he spent in total, we add the two amounts together: 250 plus 1125. That gives us 1375.

So, the real estate agent spent $1375 in total on buying all the ads. The answer is $1375."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

A juggler can handle 16 balls. Half of these balls are golf balls, so that means there are 8 golf balls. Now, half of these golf balls are blue, so that means there are 4 blue golf balls.

So, the number of blue golf balls is 4.

The answer is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mary buys 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so that's 300 plus 12, which is 312 M&Ms. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so that's 300 divided by 2, which is 150 M&Ms.

Now, to find out how many M&Ms Mary got in total, we add them all up: 300 from the first bag, 312 from the second bag, and 150 from the third bag. So, 300 plus 312 plus 150 equals 762 M&Ms.

So, Mary got 762 M&Ms in total."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John has two houses. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, in one house, there are 3 bedrooms times 2 windows per bedroom, which is 6 windows from the bedrooms. Since he has two houses, that's 6 windows/house times 2 houses, which is 12 windows from the bedrooms in total.

Now, each house also has 4 windows that aren't in the bedrooms. So, for two houses, that's 4 windows/house times 2 houses, which is 8 windows that aren't in the bedrooms.

If we add the windows from the bedrooms and the windows that aren't in the bedrooms, we get 12 windows + 8 windows, which equals 20 windows.

So, the total number of windows between the houses is 20."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The mom buys some stuff at the store. She buys cocoa for $4.20, laundry for $9.45, and pasta for $1.35. She gives $20 to pay for it all.

First, we add up how much she spent:
- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

So, $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

She gave $20 to pay, so to find out how much she gets back, we take $20 and subtract the $15 she spent:
- $20 - $15 = $5

So, the change she gets back is $5."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Terri is making a sweater with a body, a collar, and a rosette. The body takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that, so that's 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, so that's 180 stitches.

Now, if we add up all these, we get:
- Body: 900 stitches
- Collar: 90 stitches
- Rosette: 180 stitches

That's 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches for the body, collar, and rosette.

The whole sweater is supposed to be 1800 stitches. So, the rest of the stitches must be for the sleeves. That means:
1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches for the sleeves.

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the 630 stitches by 2:
630 ÷ 2 = 315 stitches for each sleeve.

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Mrs. Rylan bought tomato seeds and celery seeds. She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, for the tomato seeds, she spent:

\[ 20 \times 40 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

She also bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. So, for the celery seeds, she spent:

\[ 80 \times 30 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much money she used in total, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together:

\[ 800 + 2400 = 3200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mrs. Rylan used 3200 dollars to buy the seeds. The answer is 3200 dollars."
"Okay, let me break it down simply. Sean has to memorize lines for three parts: a solo song, a first scene, and a second scene.

1. The solo song has 54 lines, and Sean has to memorize all of them.
2. The first scene has twice as many lines as the song, so it has 54 * 2 = 108 lines. But only a third of those lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines.
3. The second scene has 6 more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. And Sean has to memorize four-fifths of those lines, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines.

Now, to find out how many lines Sean has to memorize in total, we add up all the lines he has to memorize:
54 (solo song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.

So, Sean has to memorize 138 lines in total. The answer is 138."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Carly started with 80 cards. Out of these, 2/5 had the letter A. So, we calculate 2/5 of 80, which is 32. That means 32 cards had A.

After taking out the 32 cards with A, we have 80 - 32 = 48 cards left. Then, half of these remaining cards had the letter B. So, 1/2 of 48 is 24. That means 24 cards had B.

Now, we take out the 24 cards with B, leaving us with 48 - 24 = 24 cards. Then, 5/8 of these remaining cards had the letter C. So, 5/8 of 24 is 15. That means 15 cards had C.

The rest of the cards, which is 24 - 15 = 9 cards, had the letter D. So, the number of cards with the letter D is 9."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Matthew needs to dig holes for shrubs and trees. For each small hole, he takes 3 minutes. For each big hole, he takes 10 minutes.

He needs to dig 30 small holes, so that's 30 times 3 minutes, which is 90 minutes. Then he needs to dig 15 big holes, which is 15 times 10 minutes, so that's 150 minutes.

Now, if we add 90 minutes and 150 minutes together, we get 240 minutes. But we need to know how many hours that is. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 240 by 60, which gives us 4 hours.

So, it will take him 4 hours to dig all those holes. The answer is 4 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mico and Marco's ages add up to 20 now. So, if we think about it, in 10 years, they'll both be 10 years older. That means we just add 10 to each of their ages and then add those 10s together.

So, if they're 20 now, in 10 years, they'll be:

- Mico: 20 + 10 = 30
- Marco: 20 + 10 = 30

Now, if we add those 30s together, we get:

30 + 30 = 60

But we forgot to add the 10 they both got older by. So, we add that 10 too:

60 + 10 = 70

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 70."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have two people, Ruby and Sam. The problem tells us that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. So if Sam is 6 years old, Ruby would be 6 times 6, which is 36 years old.

The problem also says that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So if we add 9 years to Sam's age, he will be 6 + 9 = 15 years old. And if we add 9 years to Ruby's age, she will be 36 + 9 = 45 years old. And 45 is indeed 3 times 15.

So, Sam is currently 6 years old."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Peter bought 20 popsicles, and each one cost him 25 cents. So, 20 times 25 cents is 500 cents, which is the same as 5 dollars. Then he bought 4 ice cream bars, and each one cost him 50 cents. So, 4 times 50 cents is 200 cents, which is the same as 2 dollars. Now, if you add 5 dollars and 2 dollars together, you get 7 dollars. So, Peter paid a total of 7 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have cobras and mambas in a park. Each cobra has 70 spots, and there are 40 cobras. So, all the cobras together have 70 spots/cobra * 40 cobras = 2800 spots.

Each mamba has half the spots of a cobra, so each mamba has 70 spots / 2 = 35 spots. There are 60 mambas, so all the mambas together have 35 spots/mamba * 60 mambas = 2100 spots.

Now, if we add the spots of all the cobras and mambas together, we get 2800 spots + 2100 spots = 4900 spots.

To find half the number of spots, we divide 4900 by 2, which gives us 4900 / 2 = 2450 spots.

So, the answer is 2450 spots."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Maddy is having a pizza party for her cousin's soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 friends, so that's 12 team members times 2 friends each, which is 24 friends. So, in total, there are 12 team members + 3 coaches + 24 friends = 39 people.

Now, each pizza can feed 3 people. So, to find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can feed: 39 people ÷ 3 people per pizza = 13 pizzas.

Each pizza costs $15, so to find out how much Maddy spends, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost of each pizza: 13 pizzas × $15 per pizza = $195.

So, Maddy will spend $195 on pizzas."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Katerina makes necklaces with topaz gemstones and sterling silver beads. Each necklace is 25 inches long. Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long, and she uses 8 of them. So, the topaz gemstones take up 8 inches of the necklace. That leaves 25 - 8 = 17 inches for the silver beads. Since each silver bead is 1/4 inch long, we divide the remaining length by the length of one bead: 17 / 0.25 = 68 beads.

So, Katerina uses 68 silver beads for each necklace. The answer is 68."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week, and she wrote twice as many in the second week, so that's 40 stories. Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week and 80 stories in the second week. Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week and 120 stories in the second week.

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote:
- Alani: 20 + 40 = 60 stories
- Braylen: 40 + 80 = 120 stories
- Margot: 60 + 120 = 180 stories

Now, let's add all their stories together:
60 + 120 + 180 = 360 stories

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ann is 9 years old. Her brother is twice as old as Ann, so he's 18 years old. Now, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 3 years older than 18. So, we add 3 to 18:

18 + 3 = 21

So, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 21 years old. The answer is 21."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Kelly has some coins. She has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. A quarter is like 25 cents, so 5 quarters are 5 times 25 cents, which is 125 cents. Two dimes are 2 times 10 cents, which is 20 cents. So, all together, Kelly has 125 cents from the quarters and 20 cents from the dimes, which makes 145 cents.

Now, she buys a can of pop that costs 55 cents. To find out how much she has left, we take the 145 cents she had and subtract the 55 cents she spent. So, 145 cents minus 55 cents is 90 cents.

So, Kelly has 90 cents left. The answer is 90 cents."
"Okay, let's break it down simply. We have a flag with 76 stars in total. There are 3 rows with 8 stars each, and 2 rows with 6 stars each. So, let's count those first:

- 3 rows of 8 stars each: \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars
- 2 rows of 6 stars each: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars

Now, let's add those up: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars are in the rows of 8 and 6 stars.

That leaves us with \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars for the rows of 5 stars. Since each of those rows has 5 stars, we divide the remaining stars by 5 to find out how many rows there are:

- \(40 \div 5 = 8\) rows

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 80 flagstones, and each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. So, 80 times 75 pounds is 6000 pounds. Now, the trucks can carry 2000 pounds each. To find out how many trucks we need, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[ 6000 \div 2000 = 3 \]

So, we need 3 trucks to carry all the flagstones. That means the answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. The car in the fast lane was going 60 miles an hour and it traveled 480 miles. To find out how long it took, we divide the distance by the speed: 480 miles ÷ 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.

Now, the car in the slow lane was going half as fast, so it was going 30 miles an hour. To find out how long it took to travel the same 480 miles, we do the same thing: 480 miles ÷ 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to travel 480 miles. The answer is 16 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ali won 22 medals. His buddy Izzy won 5 less than Ali, so Izzy won 22 - 5 = 17 medals. Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.

Now, the problem says that Ali and Izzy's medals are 10 times less than the total medals given out. This means if Ali and Izzy have 39 medals, then the total medals given out is 39 times 10.

So, 39 times 10 is 390. That means 390 medals were given out for counting.

The answer is 390 medals."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet has 5 bars. So, we have a total of 40 chocolate bars.

Now, 4 adults are sharing these bars, and each gets 6 bars. So, 4 adults getting 6 bars each means they get 24 bars in total.

That leaves us with 40 bars minus 24 bars, which is 16 bars. These 16 bars are for the 8 children.

To share these 16 bars equally among the 8 children, each child gets 2 bars.

So, each child gets 2 chocolate bars. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Susan works for 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. But she takes a 30-minute break, so she actually works for 150 minutes.

For every 10 minutes, she gets $5. So, in 150 minutes, we can figure out how many 10-minute blocks there are by dividing 150 by 10. That gives us 15 blocks. Since each block is $5, we multiply 15 by 5 to get the total money she earns.

\[ 15 \times 5 = 75 \]

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task. The answer is $75."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

In the game, we have three friends: Mike, Jim, and Tony. After three rounds, Mike has 21 points, Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 18 points, and Tony has 2 times more than Mike, so Tony has 42 points.

In the fourth round, only Tony gets an extra point because he has more than 20 points. So, after the fourth round:
- Mike still has 21 points.
- Jim still has 18 points.
- Tony gets 1 extra point, so he has 43 points.

Now, we add up all their points:
- Mike: 21 points
- Jim: 18 points
- Tony: 43 points

So, the total points they have together is 21 + 18 + 43 = 82 points.

The final answer is 82 points."
"Will had 15 oranges. His oldest son is 8 years old and his youngest son is half that age, so the youngest son is 4 years old. Together, they washed 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. So, the number of oranges left unwashed is 15 - 12 = 3 oranges. 

The answer is 3 oranges."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easy to understand.

Darren did some exercises over two days. On the first day, he did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Double the number of dumbbell presses, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up all the exercises he did:
- Pushups: 100 + 120 = 220
- Squats: 50 + 40 = 90
- Dumbbell presses: 20 + 40 = 60

So, the total number of exercises he did is 220 + 90 + 60 = 370.

The total count of the activities he did in the two days is 370."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice for lunch and dinner, so that's 2 kg for the whole family in a day. There are 5 people in the family, and they eat every lunch and dinner, so that's 2 kg per day for 5 people.

Now, if we want to know how much rice they eat in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (days in a week). So, 2 kg/day times 7 days equals 14 kg per week.

We have a big bag of 42 kg of rice. If the family eats 14 kg of rice every week, we can find out how many weeks the rice will last by dividing the total amount of rice by the weekly consumption. So, 42 kg divided by 14 kg per week equals 3 weeks.

So, the bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. The answer is 3 weeks."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Sam wants to sell 120 crates of bread in a week. He didn't sell any on Monday and Friday, and he sold 20 crates over the weekend. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday, 12 crates, and on Thursday, 18 crates.

So, let's add up what he sold:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Weekend: 20 crates

Now, let's add these up: 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 crates.

Sam's goal was to sell 120 crates, but he only sold 65 crates. So, to find out how many he was short, we do:
120 - 65 = 55 crates.

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his goal. The answer is 55 crates."
"Okay, let me explain this clearly. Carmen starts with $200 and each of the other bidders goes up by $50 each time. So, the bids go like this:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. John uses a driving service to go to work and back home every day. His work is 30 miles away, so he drives 60 miles each day (30 miles to work and 30 miles back). He does this 5 days a week and for 50 weeks in a year, so he drives 3000 miles in a year.

The driving service charges $2 for every mile driven. So, for 3000 miles, the cost would be \(3000 \times 2 = 6000\) dollars.

The service also gives him a $150 bonus each month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus he gets in a year is \(150 \times 12 = 1800\) dollars.

So, the total cost for the year is the cost of the miles driven plus the bonus, which is \(6000 + 1800 = 7800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is \(\boxed{7800}\) dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

On Monday, Peter did 16 minutes of exercise. On Sunday, he did 23 minutes. So, if we add those up, we get 16 + 23 = 39 minutes.

Now, Peter wants to do twice that amount on Tuesday. So, we do 39 times 2, which is 78 minutes.

So, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday. The answer is 78 minutes."
"To make a 32-page tabloid, you fold a piece of paper in half vertically. When you unfold it, you get two layers. Each layer can have two pages printed on it, one on the front and one on the back. So, one piece of paper can print 4 pages.

Now, if you want to print 32 pages, you need to figure out how many pieces of paper you need. Since one piece of paper can print 4 pages, you divide the total number of pages by the number of pages one piece of paper can print:

32 pages ÷ 4 pages per piece of paper = 8 pieces of paper.

So, you need 8 pieces of paper to make a 32-page tabloid. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Annika had $50 to spend at the fair. She first used half of that, which is $25, on food and snacks. Then she spent an extra $10 on rides. So, in total, she spent $25 + $10 = $35. If she started with $50 and spent $35, then she has $50 - $35 = $15 left. So, the amount of money Annika has left is $15."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Elise's dad had 250 books. Now, there are 50 books left, so she sold 200 books in total. She sold 45 books this year, and in the first year, she sold twice as many as this year, so that's 90 books. Now, if we add the books sold in the first year, this year, and the books left, it should be 250. 

So, 90 (first year) + 45 (this year) + 50 (left) = 185, but we know she sold 200 books in total. That means the rest of the books sold were in the second year. 

Now, if she sold 200 books in total and 45 in the second year, the money she made in the second year is 45 books times $20 each. 

So, 45 times 20 is 900. 

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is $900. 

The answer is: $900"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Watson works 10 hours a day and gets paid $10 for each hour. So, in one day, he makes:
\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

He works 5 days a week, so in one week, he makes:
\[ 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

If the company performs well, he gets an extra $300 bonus each week. So, his total weekly pay is:
\[ 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

April has 30 days, and if the company performs well every week, he gets 4 full weeks of pay in April. So, his total pay for April is:
\[ 800 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

But we also need to add the bonus for those 4 weeks:
\[ 3200 \, \text{\$} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 3200 \, \text{\$} + 1200 \, \text{\$} = 4400 \, \text{\$} \]

So, Watson made $4400 in April if the company performed very well for the whole month. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4400} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John plays arm wrestle with 20 people. He wins against 80% of them. To find out how many he won, we do this:

80% of 20 is 16 because 80% is the same as 80 out of 100, and 100 divided by 20 is 5, so 80 times 5 is 400, and 400 divided by 100 is 4, and 4 times 20 is 80. So, 80% of 20 is 16.

That means he beat 16 people. Now, to find out how many he lost to, we take the total number of people he played against, which is 20, and subtract the number he beat, which is 16. So, 20 minus 16 is 4.

So, John lost to 4 people. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread every day. In the morning, they sell two out of every three loaves. So, they sell 40 loaves in the morning because 2/3 of 60 is 40.

After the morning, they have 60 - 40 = 20 loaves left.

In the afternoon and evening, they sell half of the remaining loaves. So, they sell half of 20, which is 10 loaves.

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so that means he loses 2 pounds each week. Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, Sandy needs to lose 8 pounds too. If Sandy takes 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, then it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight Joey does in one week. So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Imagine you have a tub of ice cream that usually costs $13, but now it's $11. That means you save $2 on one tub of ice cream. If you buy 2 tubs, you save $2 times 2, which is $4.

Now, for the milk, if one packet used to cost $1 and now it costs $0.5, you save $0.5 on one packet. If you buy 4 packets, you save $0.5 times 4, which is $2.

So, if you add the savings from the ice cream and the milk together, you save $4 plus $2, which is $6 in total.

So, the total savings you get by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $6."

The serum makes you grow an extra arm every 3 days. So, in 15 days, we count how many 3-day periods fit into 15 days. That's 15 divided by 3, which is 5. So, you get 5 extra arms.

It also makes you grow an extra leg every 5 days. In 15 days, we count how many 5-day periods fit into 15 days. That's 15 divided by 5, which is 3. So, you get 3 extra legs.

Now, to find out how many new limbs you get, you add the extra arms and extra legs together. So, 5 extra arms plus 3 extra legs equals 8 new limbs.

So, the answer is 8 new limbs."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Theo has $6000 for his trip. He spends some money on different things:

- He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so that's $600.
- He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so that's $150.
- The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that is $500, and $700 more is $1200.

So, the total cost for these things is $600 (suits) + $150 (suitcases) + $1200 (flight) = $1950.

He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he can spend $6000 - $2000 = $4000 on other things.

After buying the suits, suitcases, and flight, he has $4000 - $1950 = $2050 left to spend on gifts.

So, Theo has $2050 to spend on gifts. The answer is:

**$2050**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a family of 5 people. Three of them eat 3 eggs each day, and the other two eat 2 eggs each day. We want to know how many eggs they eat in a week.

First, let's see how many eggs the three people eat in a day:
- Each of the three people eats 3 eggs, so together they eat \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs a day.

Next, let's see how many eggs the other two people eat in a day:
- Each of the two people eats 2 eggs, so together they eat \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs a day.

Now, let's add these together to see how many eggs the whole family eats in a day:
- The total is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs a day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs they eat in a day by 7:
- \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs in a week.

So, the family eats 91 eggs in a week. The answer is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know Quinn is 30 years old. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so Jane is 27 years old. Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so Trent is 32 years old. Therefore, Trent is 32 years old."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Six years ago, Cera was 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half her age, so he was 20 years old. That means Noah is now 26 years old (20 + 6).

Now, we know that six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now, and it was also 3000 times Noah's age. So, six years ago, the population was 3000 times 20, which is 60,000. This means the current population is twice that, so it's 120,000.

But the population six years ago was half of what it is now, so the current population is twice 120,000, which is 240,000.

So, the population of Chile now is 240,000."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a football team with 105 players in total. The number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, and the number on the special teams is half the number on the defense.

If we let the number of players on the defense be \( D \), then:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

So, the total number of players is:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ 3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30. The answer is 30."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Martha invited some people to her Christmas party. She invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 times 6, which is 12 people. Then she invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 times 4, which is 12 people too. So, in total, she invited 12 plus 12, which is 24 people.

But some people couldn't come. 8 people couldn't come because they were sick. And 1/4 of those 8 people couldn't come because of other reasons. So, 1/4 of 8 is 2 people.

So, 8 people were sick and 2 had other reasons, which makes 10 people who couldn't come.

Now, if we take away the 10 people who couldn't come from the 24 people she invited, we get 24 minus 10, which is 14 people.

So, 14 people came to Martha's Christmas party."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Solomon got 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. His dad gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he got from Johanna. So, we calculate 2/5 of 20, which is 8 marbles.

Now, Solomon has 20 marbles from Johanna and 8 from his dad, so he has a total of 28 marbles.

Each marble weighs 2 kg, so to find the total weight, we multiply the number of marbles by the weight of each marble. That's 28 marbles times 2 kg per marble, which equals 56 kg.

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is 56 kg. The answer is 56 kg."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a pool that's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 5 feet deep. To find out how much it costs to fill, we first need to know how much space the pool takes up, which is called the volume. We find the volume by multiplying the length, width, and depth together:

\[ 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it costs $0.1 to fill one cubic foot. So, to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of cubic feet by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, it costs $12 to fill the pool."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a classroom with boys. The problem tells us there are 30 boys.

Now, for every boy, there are 3 girls. So, if we have 30 boys, we multiply that by 3 to find out how many girls there are:
\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]
So, there are 90 girls.

The problem also says there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. So, we take the number of boys (30) and divide it by 10 to find out how many nongendered children there are:
\[ 30 \div 10 = 3 \]
So, there are 3 nongendered children.

Now, to find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:
\[ 30 \text{ (boys)} + 90 \text{ (girls)} + 3 \text{ (nongendered children)} = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. If we have 45 electric wires, we need to find out how many poles we have.

Since 3 wires make 1 pole, we can divide the number of wires by 3 to find the number of poles.

So, \( 45 \div 3 = 15 \).

Therefore, we need 15 electric poles.

The answer is: 15"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

At first, there were 25 men and 15 women at the party. So, there were 40 people in total.

After an hour, 1/4 of the people left. That means 1/4 of 40 people, which is 10 people, left the party.

If 22 men stayed, that means 22 men didn't leave. So, the number of men who left is 25 (total men) - 22 (men who stayed) = 3 men.

Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the rest must have been women. So, 10 - 3 = 7 women left.

If there were originally 15 women, and 7 of them left, then the number of women who stayed is 15 - 7 = 8 women.

So, the number of women left at the party is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. A book costs $4. Now, a magazine costs half as much as the book, so the magazine costs $2. A pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so the pen costs $1. Therefore, the pen costs $1."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jam has 26 pencils in total. She has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils. So, each box has 8 pencils because 26 minus 2 (the loose pencils) is 24, and 24 divided by 3 is 8.

Meg has 46 pencils.

To find out how many boxes they need, we add their pencils together: 26 (Jam's) + 46 (Meg's) = 72 pencils.

Now, if each box can hold 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold: 72 divided by 8 equals 9.

So, they need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The answer is 9."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Shannon makes iced coffee by cooling it and adding ice cubes. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees and makes it 12 milliliters weaker. If she wants to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, she needs 5 ice cubes because 65 divided by 13 is 5. Each ice cube makes it 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes make it 60 milliliters weaker.

Now, she also adds 15 milliliters of cream, but that doesn't change how much weaker the coffee is. It just makes the drink bigger.

So, the coffee is 60 milliliters weaker after cooling and adding cream. The answer is 60 milliliters weaker."
"Oh, okay. So we got 5 people and they all want to trade their old records for new ones. For every 2 old records, they can get 1 new record. And at the end, they all leave with 7 new records. So we need to figure out how many old records they brought in total.

If 2 old records make 1 new record, then to get 7 new records, they must have brought in 2 times 7, which is 14 old records. So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records in total.

The answer is: 14"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The company has 100 people working there. Out of these, 40 are junior programmers and 60 are senior programmers. The junior programmers each get $2000 a month, and the senior programmers get $400 more than that, so they get $2400 a month.

Now, to find out how much the company pays in total, we need to add up all the money paid to the junior programmers and the senior programmers.

For the junior programmers:
40 junior programmers * $2000 each = $80,000

For the senior programmers:
60 senior programmers * $2400 each = $144,000

Now, we add these two amounts together:
$80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

So, the company pays a total of $224,000 a month to all the programmers. The correct answer is $224,000."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine you start with some people on a bus at the beginning. Then, at the first stop, 5 more people get on. So now you have more people on the bus. At the second stop, 7 people get off and 8 more get on. After that, there are 20 people on the bus.

Now, we need to figure out how many people were on the bus at the start. Let's think it through:

1. Let's say at the start, there were 14 people on the bus.
2. Then 5 more people get on, so now there are 14 + 5 = 19 people.
3. At the second stop, 7 people get off, so 19 - 7 = 12 people.
4. Then 8 more people get on, so 12 + 8 = 20 people.

So, if we start with 14 people, after all the changes, we end up with 20 people. That means the number of people who got on at the start was 14.

So, the answer is 14."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. He eats 2 on his way to school, so he has 22 left. Then he gives 14 to his friends, so he has 8 left. He then buys twice as many as he gave to his friends, which is 28 more lollipops. So he gets 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops. Now he has 36, and he eats 3 more that night, so he has 36 - 3 = 33. Then he eats 2 more in the morning, so he has 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

The answer is 31."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The phone starts at 60% and needs to go to 100%. That's 40 more percentage points. The phone charges 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. So, for 40 percentage points, it will take:

\[
40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to convert minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[
120 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Erin originally had 7 lollipops, and her mom gave her 10 more, so she had 17 lollipops in total. Then she gave 3 lollipops to her friend. To find out how many she has left, we take 17 and subtract 3, which gives us 14. So, Erin has 14 lollipops left. 

The answer is 14."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The customer spent $80 last time and got 4 rewards because for every $20 spent, they get $1 off. So, they got 4 $1 rewards.

This time, they spent $43. They used their 4 rewards, which is $4 off. So, $43 - $4 = $39.

Then, they used a coupon that took off twice the amount of their rewards, so that's 2 times $4, which is $8 off. So, $39 - $8 = $31.

So, the customer paid $31 this time."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Nick is choosing between two jobs. In Job A, he gets paid $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year. That means he gets $30,000 a year before any taxes. The state where he works takes 20% of that, so it takes $6,000. So, after tax, he gets $24,000.

In Job B, he gets $42,000 a year, but he has to pay $6,000 in property tax. So, after paying the property tax, he has $36,000 left. The state then takes 10% of that, which is $3,600. So, after all the taxes, he gets $32,400.

Now, to find out which job gives him more money, we subtract the net pay of Job A from Job B. So, $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate. The answer is: $8,400."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 220 castles in Scotland. Out of these, 40% are ruins. So, we need to find out how many of those ruins are unmanned.

First, we calculate how many castles are ruins:
- 40% of 220 is 88. So, 88 castles are ruins.

Next, we find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned:
- Half of 88 is 44.

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

The answer is 44."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Robert wants to buy a bookshelf and a sofa. He got two offers from different stores. 

Furniture United said he needs to pay $1,350 now and then $350 every month for 6 months. So, he pays $350 x 6 = $2,100 in installments. Adding the $1,350 advance, the total cost is $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

Cozy Homes said he needs to pay $1,100 now and then $250 every month for 9 months. So, he pays $250 x 9 = $2,250 in installments. Adding the $1,100 advance, the total cost is $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, to find out how much more Furniture United wants Robert to pay, we subtract the cheaper offer from the more expensive one. So, $3,450 - $3,350 = $100.

So, Robert will pay $100 more if he chooses Furniture United. The answer is $100."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Nick, Richard, Jason, and RJ have different numbers of paintball guns. Jason has 8, Nick has 10, RJ has 1, and Richard has 5. So, if we add all these up, we get:

8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24

That means they have 24 paintball guns in total. Now, if they want to share these guns equally, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people, which is 4.

24 ÷ 4 = 6

So, if they share the guns equally, each person would get 6 guns. The answer is 6."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. Mason needs sugar to make two different things: suckers and fudge. For each batch of suckers, he needs 30 ounces of sugar. For each batch of fudge, he needs 70 ounces of sugar.

He wants to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge. So, for the suckers, he needs:
\[ 8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ ounces} \]

For the fudge, he needs:
\[ 1 \times 70 = 70 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, if we add the sugar needed for both, we get:
\[ 240 + 70 = 310 \text{ ounces} \]

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar in total. The answer is 310 ounces."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Maria bought 8 shares of a stock at $8 each. So, she spent:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

The price of the stock went up by 50% the first year. So, the price became:
\[ \$8 + 50\% \text{ of } \$8 = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

Now, she has 8 shares at $12 each:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

Then, the price went down by 25% in the second year. So, the price became:
\[ \$12 - 25\% \text{ of } \$12 = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

Now, she has 8 shares at $9 each:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times what Luke ate, so Thomas ate 6 hot dogs. John ate half of what Thomas ate, so John ate 3 hot dogs. Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract. So, 3 minus 2 is 1. John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. So the answer is 1."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a class of 200 students. They are split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 students less than each of the other two groups.

If we let the number of students in each of the two equal groups be \( x \), then the third group would have \( x - 10 \) students. The total number of students is 200, so we can write the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides gives us:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The third group, which is the smallest, has 10 students less than 70, which is:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total. He has twice as many chickens as cows. So, if we say he has 20 cows, then he must have 40 chickens because 2 times 20 is 40.

Now, cows have 4 legs each and chickens have 2 legs each. So, for the cows, 20 cows times 4 legs each equals 80 legs. For the chickens, 40 chickens times 2 legs each equals 80 legs.

If we add the legs of the cows and the chickens together, we get 80 plus 80, which is 160. So, all the animals together have 160 legs."
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. So he gets 4 more balls. That makes a total of 3 + 4 = 7 balls. But when he drops them, he loses 3 balls. So he has 7 - 3 = 4 balls left. On stage, he can't juggle 3 dropped balls, so he starts with 4 balls. 

The answer is: 4 balls."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a pink frog that weighs 50 pounds. Now, a blue beetle weighs the same as a pink frog, so it's also 50 pounds. A green toad weighs the same as a pink frog, so it's also 50 pounds. A yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so that's 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. A red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so that's 50 - 20 = 30 pounds. Now, we add all these up with the container that weighs 20 pounds:

50 (pink frog) + 50 (blue beetle) + 50 (green toad) + 60 (yellow snake) + 30 (red bird) + 20 (container) = 260 pounds.

So, the total weight is 260 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Laurel got 24 outfits from her friend. Then, her friend gave her twice that amount at her baby shower, so that's 24 times 2, which is 48 outfits. Her mom also gave her 15 outfits.

Now, we add all these up: 24 (from her friend) + 48 (from the baby shower) + 15 (from her mom) = 87 outfits.

So, Laurel has 87 outfits for her baby. The answer is 87."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Tyson usually runs 5000 meters a day. His coach wants him to run a little more, so he decides to run 1/5 times more than 5000 meters. That means he adds 1000 meters to his usual distance. So now, he runs 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters a day.

If he does this for a whole month in June, which has 30 days, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in June. So, 6000 meters/day × 30 days = 180000 meters.

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters. The answer is 180000 meters."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have three juice boxes:
- Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.
- Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 5 = 9 dollars.
- Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so it's 4 + 7 = 11 dollars.

Now, we want to know how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B. So, we take the cost of Juice Box C and subtract the cost of Juice Box B:
11 - 9 = 2 dollars.

So, Juice Box C costs 2 dollars more than Juice Box B. The answer is 2 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have two kinds of tables in the restaurant. There are 40 tables that each have 4 legs, and 50 tables that each have 3 legs.

First, let's count the legs on the 40 tables with 4 legs each:
- 40 times 4 is 160.

Next, let's count the legs on the 50 tables with 3 legs each:
- 50 times 3 is 150.

Now, we add these two numbers together to find the total number of legs:
- 160 plus 150 is 310.

So, the total number of legs on all the tables in the restaurant is 310."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jenny buys cookies every week. Each week, she gets 36 cookies. She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box every day for 5 days. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days. We need to find out how many cookies Jenny eats.

First, let's see how many cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box in a week. She puts 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

Next, her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

Now, we take the total number of cookies she gets in a week, which is 36, and subtract the cookies her son takes and the cookies her husband eats. So, 36 - 20 - 7 = 9 cookies.

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies. The answer is 9."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Davos bought 2 shirts that cost $30 each. So, the total cost without any discount is $60. But he got a 40% discount on these shirts. To find out how much he saved, we calculate 40% of $60, which is $24. So, he only had to pay $60 minus $24, which is $36. Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts. The answer is $36."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors each day and each tractor was worth $100. So, they made $1000 each day from selling tractors.

Now, they make silos instead. They sell 5 silos each day and each silo is worth $220. So, they make $1100 each day from selling silos.

To find out how much more they make now, we need to see how much more $1100 is compared to $1000. The difference is $1100 - $1000 = $100. To find out what percentage $100 is of $1000, we do $100 / $1000 * 100 = 10%.

So, they are making 10% more money now. The answer is 10%."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Madeline has to buy food, treats, and medicine for her dog every month. The food costs $25 each week, and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, for food, she spends $25 times 4, which is $100 a month. Treats cost $20 a month, and medicine costs $100 a month.

So, the total cost for the month is $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $120 a month.

Now, to find out how much she spends in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (months in a year). So, $120 times 12 is $1440.

So, Madeline spends $1440 on her dog every year. The closest answer from the options given would be $1440."
"Okay, let me break it down simply. Peyton has a few activities planned:

- On Monday, she has a yoga class that lasts 1 hour.
- On Tuesday, she has a cooking class that lasts 3 times as long as Monday's yoga, so that's 3 hours.
- On Wednesday, she has a cheese-tasting event that lasts 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.
- On Thursday, she has a museum tour that lasts half as long as the cooking class, so that's 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, she has to do some errands that take 2 hours.

Now, let's add them up: 1 hour (Monday) + 3 hours (Tuesday) + 0.5 hours (Wednesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 7.5 hours.

So, all of Peyton's after-work activities will take her 7.5 hours. The answer is 7.5 hours."
"April needed 30 plant pots for daisies and twice as many for roses, so she needed 60 plant pots for roses. In total, she needed 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots. She already had 100 plant pots. So, the number of plant pots she has left over is 100 - 90 = 10. 

The answer is 10."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Andrea started with $36. She spent some money on a sweater that cost $11 and gave $4 to her brother. So, she spent a total of $11 + $4 = $15.

If she started with $36 and spent $15, then the amount she saved is $36 - $15 = $21.

So, Andrea saved $21."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. John did a lot of fun things on his vacation. He spent 6 hours on the boat and half that time, which is 3 hours, swimming. He also watched 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so that's 6 hours there too. All together, he spent 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours on those activities. That 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on all his activities. To find out the total time, we divide 15 by 0.30, which gives us 50 hours. Now, he spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. To find out how much time that is, we take 40% of 50 hours, which is 20 hours. So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing. The answer is 20 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Annabelle wants a phone that costs $400. She already has $80 saved up. She works at her first job for 20 hours and gets paid $10 for each hour. So, she earns $10 times 20, which is $200. At her second job, she works for 15 hours and gets paid $5 for each hour, so she earns $5 times 15, which is $75.

Now, let's add up all the money she has:
- The $80 she already had
- The $200 from her first job
- The $75 from her second job

So, $80 + $200 + $75 = $355.

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more she needs, we subtract the $355 she has from the $400 cost of the phone:
- $400 - $355 = $45.

So, Annabelle still needs $45 to buy the phone. The answer is $45."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have three trees in Eddy's backyard. The shortest one is 6 feet tall. The second one is 5 feet taller than the shortest one, so it's 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. Now, the tallest tree is twice the height of the shortest and the second tree put together. So, we add the heights of the shortest and the second tree: 6 + 11 = 17 feet. The tallest tree is twice that, so it's 17 * 2 = 34 feet tall. Therefore, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Dean's mom gave him $28 to buy toys. He bought 6 toy cars at $2 each and 5 teddy bears at $1 each. So, the toy cars cost him 6 times 2, which is 12 dollars. The teddy bears cost him 5 times 1, which is 5 dollars. So, the total cost of the toys is 12 plus 5, which is 17 dollars.

After buying the toys, Dean has $28 minus $17, which is $11 left. Then, his mom gives him an extra $10. So, he gets $11 plus $10, which is $21.

So, the money Dean has left is $21."
"Morgan's dad said she had $90 for her birthday party. She wants to play mini-golf, get some arcade tokens, and go on the go-karts twice. Playing mini-golf costs $5, and the arcade tokens cost $5. Each go-kart ride costs $10, and she wants to go twice, so that's $10 times 2, which is $20. So, the total cost for these things is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. That leaves her with $90 - $30 = $60. With the remaining money, she can go on the go-kart twice for each friend. So, with $60 and each go-kart ride costing $10, she can go on the go-kart twice for 6 friends. So, the number of friends she can invite is 6. The answer is 6."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Marisa gets $5 every day from her parents. She buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. So, she spends 1 dollar on lollipops each day because 4 times 25 cents is 1 dollar.

Now, if she gets $5 and spends $1 on lollipops, she saves $4 each day. If she saves $4 for 5 days, she saves a total of $20.

So, the amount of money she puts in her piggy bank after 5 days is $20."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Billy had $10 and he spent some of it on candy. The candy costs $1.50 per pound. After buying the candy, he had $4 left. If he took half of that $4 and used it to buy gumballs that cost $0.05 each, he bought 40 gumballs. Now, we need to find out how many pounds of candy he bought.

To find out, we can say Billy spent $10 - $4 = $6 on candy. Since candy costs $1.50 per pound, we can figure out how many pounds he bought by dividing $6 by $1.50. So, $6 ÷ $1.50 = 4 pounds.

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Carver is 45 years old, and that's 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, if we think about it, if Carver was twice his son's age, he would be 50 years old. But he's only 45, so his son's age must be less than that. If we take 45 and add 5, we get 50. Half of 50 is 25, so Carver's son must be 25 years old. Therefore, the answer is 25."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

The train travels 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and then 50 miles less than the total of the second and third city trip from the third city back to the first city. So, the trip from the third city to the first city is 100 + 75 - 50 = 125 miles.

Now, the total distance for one complete round trip (first to third city and back to the first city) is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles. Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval: 900 / 18,000 = 1/20 of a day. 

Since 1/20 of a day is 12 hours, the train goes between services every 12 hours. So, the answer is:

12 hours"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

First, we need to know how much stuffing each type of dog bed gets. A Rottweiler bed gets 8 pounds, and a chihuahua bed gets 2 pounds. A collie bed gets the average of these two, so it's 5 pounds (because (8 + 2) / 2 = 5).

Now, Mark is making 4 chihuahua beds. So, 4 times 2 pounds is 8 pounds. That's for the chihuahuas.

Next, he's making 3 collie beds. So, 3 times 5 pounds is 15 pounds. That's for the collies.

Now, we add the stuffing for the chihuahuas and the collies together: 8 pounds + 15 pounds = 23 pounds.

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing in total. The answer is 23 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. John drives to his friend's house which is 200 miles away at 70 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes, we divide the distance by the speed, so 200 miles divided by 70 miles per hour equals about 2.857 hours. He had to take a longer way back home because of a detour, which added 10 miles, making the trip 210 miles. At 70 miles per hour, it takes him 3 hours to get back. On the way back, he drives 240 miles at 80 miles per hour, which takes him 3 hours. So, the total time is 2.857 hours to the friend's house, 3 hours back because of the detour, and 3 hours back home. Adding these up, we get about 8.857 hours. 

So, the total trip time is about 8.857 hours. 

If we had to pick from the options given, the closest one would be 9 hours. 

The final answer is: **9 hours**."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. So, the rest must be boys. That means there are 53 boys. Now, on Friday, 5 girls were absent, so that means 38 girls were present. Since there are 96 students in total, that means 58 boys were present. But we know that 4 boys were also absent, so the number of boys who were at school on Friday is 54. 

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is 54. 

The answer is: 54"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart. There are 6 girls in the park. Now, if there are twice as many boys as girls, that means there are 12 boys. So, if you add the girls and the boys together, you get 6 girls plus 12 boys, which makes 18 kids in total. So, the total number of kids in the park is 18."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jane needs to get at least 42 points total across three tests. She already got 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. So, she has 33 points from those two tests.

Now, to find out how many points she needs on the third test, we do this:

42 (total points needed) - 33 (points she already has) = 9

So, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. The answer is 9 points."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We know that 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks. That's 3 people.

Then, for shoplifting, it's said to be four times that number minus 5. So, 4 times 3 is 12, and then minus 5 is 7. So, 7 people were kicked out for shoplifting.

For physical violence, it's three times the number of shoplifters, so 3 times 7 is 21. That means 21 people were kicked out for that.

Now, if we add all these up: 3 (for not wearing masks) + 7 (for shoplifting) + 21 (for physical violence) = 31 people.

If 50 people were kicked out in total, then the rest must be for other reasons. So, 50 minus 31 is 19.

So, 19 people were kicked out for other reasons."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Sara scored 8 points. Now, Erin has three times more points than Sara. So, if Sara has 8 points, Erin has 3 times that, which is 24 points after scoring 14 more.

To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14, we take away the 14 points she scored from the 24 points she has now. So, Erin had 10 points before.

The answer is: 10"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way without all the big words.

We have 44 seniors getting awards. Each senior gets a picture frame that costs $20. But to make it more special, they also get their picture frame etched, which costs an extra 20% of $20. So, the total cost for each picture frame is $20 + $4 = $24. Since there are 44 seniors, we multiply $24 by 44 to get the total cost for the picture frames, which is $1056.

Then, 2 seniors get special pins that cost $5 each, so that's $5 times 2, which is $10.

Lastly, 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so that's 44 divided by 4, which is 11 officers. Each officer gets a cord that costs $12, so we multiply $12 by 11 to get the total cost for the cords, which is $132.

Now, we add up all these costs: $1056 for the picture frames, $10 for the pins, and $132 for the cords. When we add these together, we get $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is $1198."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The wallpaper costs $400 at the market. If Ethan makes his own, he saves 20% of that cost. So, we first find out how much 20% of $400 is. That's $400 times 0.20, which is $80. So, Ethan saves $80. Now, we take the original $400 and subtract the $80 he saves, which gives us $320. So, Ethan would pay $320 if he makes his own wallpaper. The answer is $320."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

On Friday, they sold 14 pairs of shoes. On Saturday, they sold twice as many as Friday, so that's 28 pairs. On Sunday, they sold half as many as Saturday, so that's 14 pairs.

Now, if we add all these up: 14 (Friday) + 28 (Saturday) + 14 (Sunday) = 56 pairs.

But then, 6 people came back and said they didn't fit, so we take 6 pairs away from the 56 pairs.

So, 56 - 6 = 50 pairs.

That means they sold 50 pairs of shoes by the end of the sale."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Hallie had dance practice for different times on different days. On Tuesdays, she practiced for 1 hour. On Thursdays, she practiced for 2 hours. And on Saturdays, she practiced for twice as long as on Tuesdays, which means she practiced for 2 hours (because 1 hour times 2 is 2 hours).

So, if we add up all the hours:
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Thursday: 2 hours
- Saturday: 2 hours

That makes a total of 5 hours a week. So, Hallie had 5 hours of dance practice in a week."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The company bought $400,000 worth of equipment. But 40% of the equipment was broken and they couldn't use it. So, they only used the good parts.

To find out how much they spent on the good parts, we need to figure out how much 60% of $400,000 is because 100% - 40% = 60%.

To do this, we can calculate:
\[ 0.6 \times 400,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The answer is: **$240,000**"
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, give her 1 kg of milk each day. The other half, also 15 sheep, give her 2 kg of milk each day. So, 15 sheep giving 1 kg each day is 15 kg, and 15 sheep giving 2 kg each day is 30 kg. Adding these together, Mary gets 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk every day. So, the total milk Mary collects every day is 45 kg."
"Mrs. Sherman made 12 bread rolls for breakfast. She gave each of her 6 children 1 bread roll, so that's 6 bread rolls given to the kids. That leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 bread rolls. She then broke each of those 6 bread rolls into 8 pieces to feed to the chickens. So, she fed the chickens 6 times 8 pieces, which is 48 pieces. Therefore, the number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is 48. The answer is 48."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 40 kids in the class. Half of them like blue, so that's 20 kids. That leaves us with 20 kids. One-fourth of these 20 kids like green, so that's 5 kids. The rest, which is the rest of the 20 kids, like yellow. So, the number of kids who like yellow is 15."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Lucy sold apples for $4 each. On Monday, she made $56. To find out how many apples she sold, we divide $56 by $4. So, $56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples. That means she sold 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number she picked on Tuesday, so she picked 12 × 2 = 24 apples.

Now, to find out how many apples she picked in total, we add the apples from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday together: 14 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 24 (Wednesday) = 50 apples.

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50. The answer is 50."
"Oh, okay. So Lindsay had 50 socks to wash. She washed 10 pairs, which is 20 socks, and then 15 more socks that were all by themselves. So she washed 20 + 15 = 35 socks. That means she missed 50 - 35 = 15 socks. So the answer is 15 socks missed."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Rachel had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more. So Rachel had 23 + 42 = 65 cookies. But then her brother ate 44 of those cookies. So Rachel had 65 - 44 = 21 cookies left.

So, the number of cookies Rachel has left is 21."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Karan borrowed $3,650 and has to pay it back in 5 months with an interest rate of 10%. To find out how much she needs to pay each month, we first calculate the total amount she'll owe after 5 months, including the interest. Then we divide that by 5.

The total amount she'll owe is $3,650 times 1.10 (because of the 10% interest) raised to the power of 5 (because it's for 5 months). That gives us $5,884.41.

Now, to find out how much she needs to pay each month, we divide $5,884.41 by 5. That gives us $1,176.88.

So, Karan needs to pay $1,176.88 each month. The closest option to this would be $1,176.88.

The answer is: $1,176.88"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Cho hiked for 8 hours at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour. So, we multiply 14 by 8 to find out how far Cho went:
\[ 14 \times 8 = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Chloe hiked for 5 hours at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour. So, we multiply 9 by 5 to find out how far Chloe went:
\[ 9 \times 5 = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how much farther Cho went, we subtract the distance Chloe went from the distance Cho went:
\[ 112 - 45 = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. The answer is 67 kilometers."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so that's 100 silver pesos. Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so that's 120 gold pesos.

Now, if we add up all the silver pesos they have together, it's 50 (Axel's) + 100 (Anna's) = 150 silver pesos.

And if we add up all the gold pesos, it's 80 (Axel's) + 120 (Anna's) = 200 gold pesos.

So, if we add the silver and gold pesos together, it's 150 (silver) + 200 (gold) = 350 pesos in total.

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Millie buys supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher makes 12 cups. So, she can make 36 cups of lemonade. She sells each cup for $1, so if she sells all 36 cups, she makes $36.

She spends $18 to buy the supplies, so her profit is $36 - $18 = $18. If she sells all the lemonade in 9 hours, her profit per hour is $18 ÷ 9 = $2.

So, the profit she makes per hour is $2. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, so he has 2/5 of his land left. We know that 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares. To find out how much land he had at first, we need to figure out what 1 whole (or 5/5) of his land would be.

If 2 parts out of 5 parts is 12.8 hectares, then 1 part out of 5 parts would be 12.8 divided by 2, which is 6.4 hectares. So, 5 parts (which is his whole land) would be 6.4 times 5, which is 32 hectares.

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first. The answer is 32 hectares."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The choir has 52 members, and half of them are girls. So, there are 26 girls in the choir. On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it, so that's 13 girls. Then, the 3 teachers decide to join in. So, the total number of people who sang is 13 girls plus 3 teachers, which makes 16 people in total. So, the number of people who sang in the performance is 16."
"To find out Wilson's math grade, I added up all his test scores: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74. 

First, I added 65 and 94, which gives me 159.
Then, I added 159 and 81, which gives me 240.
Next, I added 240 and 86, which gives me 326.
Finally, I added 326 and 74, which gives me 400.

Now, I have to divide this total by the number of tests he took, which is 5. So, 400 divided by 5 is 80.

Therefore, Wilson's math grade is 80. 

The correct answer is: 80"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

An eraser costs $2, and a pencil costs $3. Now, we want to know how much 6 erasers and 8 pencils cost.

First, we look at the erasers. If one eraser costs $2, then 6 erasers will cost:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Next, we look at the pencils. If one pencil costs $3, then 8 pencils will cost:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

So, 6 erasers and 8 pencils cost $36."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James has to deliver messages to two teachers. He gives 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. For Mr. Yu, he gives a third as many messages as he gave to Ms. Thompson. So, he gives Mr. Yu \(66 \div 3 = 22\) messages.

Now, to find out the total number of messages James delivers, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu together. So, \(66 + 22 = 88\).

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

At the carnival, there are 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. So, one ride costs $4. If you buy a ride bracelet, you get 9 rides for $30. 

David buys the ride bracelet, so he only pays $30 for 9 rides. Dasha buys tickets. For 9 rides, she needs 9 tickets, and each ticket costs $2, so she pays $2 * 9 = $18. 

Now, we need to find out how much more Dasha pays than David. Dasha pays $18 and David pays $30, so Dasha pays $30 - $18 = $12 more than David. 

So, David saves $12. 

The answer is: **$12**"
"Oh, hello there! So, Monica wants to wrap gifts for her family, friends, and teachers. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 for her friends, and 2 for her teachers. That makes a total of 12 gifts. She has 144 inches of ribbon to make bows for all these gifts. To find out how much ribbon she can use for each gift, we need to divide the total ribbon by the total number of gifts. So, we do 144 inches divided by 12 gifts, which gives us 12 inches of ribbon per gift. So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know that Betty and Sam together have 165 popsicles, and the ratio of their popsicles is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.

First, we add the parts of the ratio together: 5 + 6 = 11 parts in total.

Now, we know that these 11 parts make up 165 popsicles. To find out how many popsicles one part is, we divide 165 by 11:

\[ 165 \div 11 = 15 \]

So, one part is 15 popsicles. Since Betty's part is 5, she has:

\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]

And since Sam's part is 6, he has:

\[ 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract Betty's popsicles from Sam's:

\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \]

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Tim used to have a cable package that cost $60 a month. Now, he's getting Netflix for $10 a month, Hulu for $10 a month, and Disney Plus for $10 a month. But he gets a special deal where he saves 20% on Hulu and Disney Plus, so they only cost $8 each ($10 - $2 savings).

So, the total cost for all these services is $10 (Netflix) + $8 (Hulu) + $8 (Disney Plus) = $26 a month.

Now, if he didn't have the cable package, he would have spent $60 a month. But with the streaming services, he only spends $26 a month. So, the money he saves is $60 - $26 = $34 a month.

So, Tim saves $34 a month by switching to the streaming services."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Carol spends 4 hours writing a song, which is 240 minutes. She spends half that time recording, so that's 120 minutes. She also spends 90 minutes editing.

To find out what percentage of her total time she spent editing, we first add up all the time she spent on each part:
240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes total.

Now, to find out what part of the total time she spent editing, we do:
90 minutes (editing) / 450 minutes (total) = 1/5.

To turn this into a percentage, we multiply by 100:
1/5 * 100 = 20%.

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing. The answer is 20%."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Wendy wants to put more books in a big box that has 6 rows and 6 columns. First, we need to find out how many spots there are in the box. If we have 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply them together: 6 times 6 equals 36 spots.

Now, Wendy wants to put 20 more than double the number of spots. So, we first double the number of spots, which is 36 times 2, giving us 72. Then we add 20 to 72, which makes it 92.

So, Wendy needs to carry 92 books to fill up the box. The answer is 92."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Erica made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of cards, and each box has 15 cards. So, her dad brought her 2 times 15, which is 30 cards. Now, if we add the cards Erica made to the cards her dad brought, we get 20 plus 30, which is 50 cards.

Then, Erica gave out 24 cards to her classmates and got 17 cards from her family and friends. So, we take away the 24 cards she gave out from the 50 she had, and then we add the 17 cards she got. That's 50 minus 24, which is 26, and then we add 17, which makes 43.

So, Erica now has 43 cards. The answer is 43."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We start with a whole pizza that has 12 slices. Jenny gives 1/3 of it to Bill. So, she gives 12 slices times 1/3, which is 4 slices to Bill. Then she gives 1/4 of it to Mark, which is 12 slices times 1/4, so that's 3 slices to Mark.

Now, Jenny gives away 4 slices to Bill and 3 slices to Mark, so that's 4 + 3 = 7 slices given away.

Jenny also eats 2 slices. So, in total, she gives away and eats 7 + 2 = 9 slices.

That means there are 12 slices in total and she gave away and ate 9 slices, so the number of slices left is 12 - 9 = 3 slices.

So, the number of slices left is 3."
"Mark starts with $50 and needs $300 for a bike. He earns $10 each day. To find out how many days he needs to work, we subtract what he has from what he needs: $300 - $50 = $250. Now, we divide the money he still needs by how much he earns each day: $250 ÷ $10 = 25 days. So, Mark needs to work for 25 days to save enough money for the bike. The answer is 25 days."
"Okay, let me break it down simply. Nancy found 90 spiders. She found 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders, so that's 90 divided by 3, which is 30 millipedes. Now, she found twice as many stink bugs as millipedes minus 12. So, twice 30 is 60, and then minus 12 is 48 stink bugs. Adding all these together, 90 spiders plus 30 millipedes plus 48 stink bugs gives us 168 bugs in total. So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We know Erica is 30 years old. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth is 35 years old. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice is 42 years old.

Now, to find out how much older Alice is than Erica, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age. So, 42 minus 30 is 12. 

So, the difference in their ages is 12 years. 

The answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, he drinks 16 ounces of milk in total. Now, milk has 3 calories in each ounce. To find out how many calories he gets, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce. So, 16 ounces times 3 calories per ounce equals 48 calories. Therefore, John consumes 48 calories. The answer is 48."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The builder works 6 days a week and there are 4 weeks in a month. So, in one month, he works:
\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

There are 12 months in a year, so in a year, he works:
\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

He gets paid $50 every day, so in a year, he earns:
\[ 288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the builder earns $14400 in a year."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, that means Mark needs 12 cups of flour and 4 cups of milk.

Flour comes in bags that have 2 cups each. So, to get 12 cups of flour, Mark needs to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour.

Milk comes in bottles that have 2 cups each. So, to get 4 cups of milk, Mark needs to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk.

Now, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs, we subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4.

So, Mark needs 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mel uses an air conditioner that uses 900 watts of energy for 8 hours a day. So, each day it uses 7200 watts of energy (900 watts/hour * 8 hours).

If Mel uses it for 5 hours less each day, he'll use it for 3 hours a day. So, each day it will use 2700 watts of energy (900 watts/hour * 3 hours).

The difference in energy use each day is 7200 watts - 2700 watts = 4500 watts. Over 30 days, that's 4500 watts/day * 30 days = 135000 watts. Since 1000 watts make a kilowatt, 135000 watts is the same as 135 kilowatts.

So, Mel will save 135 kilowatts of electric energy in 30 days. The answer is 135 kilowatts."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jane has some zebras with stripes. She has two zebras with 17 stripes each, one zebra with 36 stripes, and another zebra with half as many stripes as the one with 36 stripes.

So, we have:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes
- One zebra with 36 stripes
- One zebra with half of 36 stripes, which is \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes

Now, let's add them up: \(34 + 36 + 18 = 88\) stripes in total.

Jane has 3 zebras in total. To find the average, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras: \(88 / 3 = 29.33\).

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is about 29.33. 

The closest answer in a multiple-choice format would be 29.33."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tyson wants to make muffaletta sandwiches for a big game. Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and it serves 4 people. There are 20 people going to watch the game, so Tyson needs to make 5 sandwiches because 20 divided by 4 is 5.

For 5 sandwiches, he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese. The meat costs $7.00 a pound, so for 5 pounds, it would cost 5 times $7.00, which is $35.00. The cheese costs $3.00 a pound, so for 5 pounds, it would cost 5 times $3.00, which is $15.00.

So, the total cost is $35.00 for the meat and $15.00 for the cheese. Adding these up, Tyson would spend $50.00.

The answer is $50.00."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Allan starts with 40 cannolis. Then he buys 60 more, so he has 100 cannolis now. He also starts with twice as many corns as cannolis, so he has 80 corns. But then he buys 40 fewer corns, so he ends up with 60 corns.

Now, to find out how many things he has in total, we add the cannolis and the corns together:
100 cannolis + 60 corns = 160 things in total.

So, the total number of corns and cannolis Allan has is 160. The answer is 160."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Elliott wants to walk 10,000 steps a day. He walked half of that to and from school, which is 5,000 steps. Then he walked another 1,000 steps with his friend, so that's 6,000 steps in total.

Now, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal. So, the number of steps he took during his jog must be the difference between his goal and the steps he already took.

10,000 (his goal) - 6,000 (steps he already took) = 4,000 steps.

But wait, I made a mistake. The correct number of steps he had left after the 6,000 steps is 2,000, not 4,000. So, the number of steps he took during his jog is:

10,000 (his goal) - 6,000 (steps he already took) = 4,000 steps.

But since he actually had 2,000 steps left, the jog must have been:

10,000 (his goal) - 6,000 (steps he already took) - 2,000 (steps left) = 2,000 steps.

So, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is 2,000."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Toby's book is 45 pages long, and each page has 200 words. So, the book has 45 times 200 words, which is 9000 words. Toby reads 300 words in one minute, so to read 9000 words, it will take him 9000 divided by 300, which is 30 minutes.

Toby needs to leave the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to finish reading the book 50 minutes before he needs to leave. Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be 20 minutes early.

So, the answer is 20 minutes early."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way.

In May, the company hired 40 workers and each worked 40 hours a week. So, we calculate the total hours worked in May:
- 40 workers * 40 hours/worker/week * 4 weeks = 6400 hours

Each worker was paid $15 an hour, so the total money paid in May is:
- 6400 hours * $15/hour = $96000

In June, 1/4 of the workers' contracts expired. So, 1/4 of 40 workers = 10 workers left. That means 30 workers stayed. These 30 workers worked 40 hours a week for 4 weeks:
- 30 workers * 40 hours/worker/week * 4 weeks = 4800 hours

The total money paid in June is:
- 4800 hours * $15/hour = $72000

Now, to find out the total money paid in both months, we add the money from May and June:
- $96000 + $72000 = $168000

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $168000."
"Oh, okay. So Sally had $10 to spend. At the trinket shop, taffy was $3 for the first pound and half that for the second pound, so that's $3 plus $1.50, which is $4.50 for 2 pounds. She also bought 4 seashells for $1.50 each, so that's $6. And she got 4 magnets at $0.25 each, so that's $1. Now, let's add all that up: $4.50 for the taffy, $6 for the seashells, and $1 for the magnets. That makes $4.50 + $6 + $1 = $11.50. But Sally only had $10, so she's short by $1.50. So she doesn't have enough money. The answer is she's $1.50 short."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tim buys two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400 and the second pack costs twice as much, so that's $800. So, the two packs together cost $400 + $800 = $1200.

Now, Tim gets a discount on these fireworks. He gets a 20% discount, so he saves $1200 * 20% = $240.

So, after the discount, the fireworks cost $1200 - $240 = $960.

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.

So, the total amount Tim spends is $960 + $150 = $1110.

So, the total amount Tim spends is $1110."
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies every night. Over 30 days, she'll eat:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Her recipe makes 12 cookies at a time. To find out how many times she needs to make the recipe to have 60 cookies, we divide:

\[ 60 \div 12 = 5 \]

So, Shannon needs to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days. The answer is 5 dozens."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Marcy makes 50,000 candles. Out of these, 5% are dangerous and might smell like wet dog. But only 1 out of every 100 dangerous candles actually explodes. So, if we find out how many dangerous candles there are, and then figure out how many of those dangerous ones might explode, that's our answer.

First, we find out how many dangerous candles there are:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500 \text{ dangerous candles} \]

Now, out of these 2,500 dangerous candles, only 1 out of every 100 might explode:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 2,500 = 0.01 \times 2,500 = 25 \]

So, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Misha is buying 4 blouses that are 30% off. The regular price of each blouse is $20.

First, we find out how much the discount is on one blouse. The discount is 30% of $20, which is $6. So, the blouse now costs $20 - $6 = $14 after the discount.

Now, Misha is buying 4 of these discounted blouses. So, we multiply the price of one discounted blouse by 4:
$14 × 4 = $56.

So, the total cost for the 4 blouses is $56. The answer is $56."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know Joanne and her sister together gathered 500 apples. Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and 15 from the shortest trees. Her sister gathered twice as many from the tallest trees (which is 60) and three times as many from the shortest trees (which is 45). Since her sister didn't take any from the average trees, we just need to figure out how many Joanne took from the average trees to make the total 500.

So, we add up what Joanne and her sister took from the tallest and shortest trees:
\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 = 150 \]

This means Joanne and her sister took 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees together. To find out how many apples Joanne took from the average trees, we subtract 150 from the total 500 apples:
\[ 500 - 150 = 350 \]

So, Joanne took 350 apples from the average trees. The answer is 350."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a group of camels and dromedaries. Camels have two humps, and dromedaries have one hump. We know there are 180 heads in total and 304 humps. 

To find out how many dromedaries there are, we can think like this:

1. If we count all the heads, it's like counting all the people in the group. We have 180 heads.
2. If we count all the humps, it's like counting all the humps on the camels and dromedaries. We have 304 humps.

Now, let's think about how many camels and dromedaries we have. If we have 124 camels, each with 2 humps, that would give us 248 humps (124 camels * 2 humps each). But we only have 304 humps in total, so we need to find out how many dromedaries we have.

If we have 124 camels, that leaves us with 56 dromedaries (180 total - 124 camels = 56 dromedaries). Each dromedary has 1 hump, so 56 dromedaries will give us 56 humps.

So, the number of dromedaries is 56."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tom went on a trip for two weeks. He traveled 200 kilometers each day for the first 4 days. So, that's 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

Then, for the next 2 days, he traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. So, 30% of 800 km is 0.30 * 800 km = 240 km.

The next day, he didn't travel at all, so that's 0 km.

For the last 7 days, he traveled 300 kilometers each day. So, that's 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

Now, if we add all these distances together: 800 km + 240 km + 0 km + 2100 km = 3140 km.

So, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his trip."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and it's a quarter of what Zack's locker is. So, if Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's, that means Zack's locker is 5 times 4, which is 20 cubic inches.

Now, Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, so Timothy's locker must be twice the size of Zack's. That means Timothy's locker is 20 times 2, which is 40 cubic inches.

So, the size of Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Stanley's comb fell down to a place that's 4,000 feet below where he was standing. Stanley was at 10,000 feet, so his comb ended up at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet. Oliver was at 3,000 feet. To get to where Stanley's comb is, Oliver needs to climb up to 6,000 feet. So, Oliver needs to climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.

So, the number of feet Oliver must climb is 3,000 feet. 

The answer is: **3000**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mr. Josue got money from two places. The first place gave him $4000. The second place gave him twice as much as the first place, so that's $8000. Now, if we add the $4000 and the $8000, we get $12000.

Before that, Mr. Josue had $5000. So, if we add the $12000 he got to the $5000 he already had, we get $17000.

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000."
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and each boat took 5 cats, so that's 4 boats times 5 cats each, which is 20 cats taken away. That leaves 50 minus 20, which is 30 cats.

Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran away. So, 3/5 of 30 is 18 cats. That means 18 cats ran away, leaving 30 minus 18, which is 12 cats.

So, the number of cats left on the rock is 12."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Bill gets a special deal for the first 6 months where he pays $8 each month. So for 6 months, that's 6 times 8, which is 48 dollars.

Then for the next 2 months, the price goes up to $12 each month. So for 2 months, that's 2 times 12, which is 24 dollars.

After that, for the next 10 months, the price is $14 each month. So for 10 months, that's 10 times 14, which is 140 dollars.

Now, if we add all these up: 48 dollars for the first 6 months, plus 24 dollars for the next 2 months, plus 140 dollars for the next 10 months, we get 48 + 24 + 140 = 212 dollars.

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is 212 dollars."
"Oh, okay. So Cole wanted to buy some jeans for a dance contest. He saw two kinds: tattered jeans that cost $28 and jogger jeans that cost $6 less than the tattered ones. Since they were on sale, he bought both. He saved a total of $6. He saved a third of that total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's figure out how much the jogger jeans cost. If the tattered jeans cost $28, the jogger jeans cost $22 because they're $6 less.

He saved $2 from the jogger jeans and $4 from the tattered jeans. The jogger jeans cost $22, and the tattered jeans cost $28. So, the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.

So, the answer is that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The correct answer is:

C: $6"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. We have different types of vehicles to take the employees on a trip. There are 4 big buses that can each carry 60 people. So, 4 buses can carry 4 times 60, which is 240 people. Then we have 6 small buses that can each carry 30 people, so 6 buses can carry 6 times 30, which is 180 people. Lastly, we have 10 vans that can each carry 15 people, so 10 vans can carry 10 times 15, which is 150 people. Now, if we add all these up, 240 plus 180 plus 150, we get 570. So, 570 people can go on the trip. The answer is 570."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Lillian made 3 bird feeders herself and bought 3 more from the store. So, she has 6 bird feeders in total.

The store-bought feeders each attract 20 birds a day. So, 3 store-bought feeders will attract \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds a day.

Lillian's feeders she made herself attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds a day. So, 3 of her feeders will attract \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds a day.

If we add the birds from both types of feeders, we get \(60 + 90 = 150\) birds a day.

So, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day. The answer is 150."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Aleksandra ordered a bagel, soup, and a piece of cake. The bagel cost $4. The soup cost a bit more than the bagel, 25% more. So, we add 25% of $4 to $4 to find out how much the soup cost. 25% of $4 is $1, so the soup cost $4 + $1 = $5. The cake cost half the price of the bagel, so it cost $4 / 2 = $2. Now, we add the cost of the bagel, soup, and cake together: $4 + $5 + $2 = $11. So, Aleksandra paid $11 for her dinner. The answer is $11."
"Oh, okay. So Kenny wants to buy a ticket to the amusement park, and the ticket costs $100. He sells his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of his cards and has $50 left after buying the ticket. Now, to find out how many cards he started with, let's think it through.

If he keeps 1/3 of his cards, that means he sells 2/3 of his cards. He sells each card for $1.5, and he ends up with $50 after buying the ticket. So, the money he got from selling the cards is $100 (the cost of the ticket) + $50 (his spending cash) = $150.

If he got $150 from selling his cards and each card he sold was for $1.5, then the number of cards he sold is $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

Since he sold 2/3 of his cards, and 2/3 of his cards equals 100 cards, then the total number of cards he started with is 100 / (2/3) = 100 * (3/2) = 150 cards.

So, Kenny started with 150 cards."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The caterer was supposed to make enough hot dogs for half of the 36 guests to have two each. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests were supposed to have two hot dogs each, making it 36 hot dogs in total.

But then 40 guests came, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. Since only 36 hot dogs were made, 4 hot dogs were left over. That means 4 guests didn't get a second hot dog.

So, the number of guests who didn't get a second hot dog is 4.

The answer is: **4**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Indras has 6 letters in her name. Now, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name. Half of 6 is 3, and 4 more than 3 is 7. So, her sister's name has 7 letters.

Now, to find out the total number of letters in both names, we add the letters in Indras' name (6) to the letters in her sister's name (7). That makes 6 + 7 = 13.

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13. The answer is 13."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Charlotte wanted to buy some stuff for her kitchen. She wanted a pot and pans set for $120, mixing bowls for $20, and 5 utensils at $5 each. So, the total cost before any discount was $120 + $20 + $5 * 5 = $165.

The store gave her a discount of 20% on everything. So, we need to find out what 20% of $165 is. That's 0.20 * $165 = $33.

Now, we take the total cost before the discount and subtract the discount amount: $165 - $33 = $132.

So, Charlotte's order cost her $132. The answer is $132."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Dora wants to buy three things:
- A skipping rope that costs $6
- A board game that costs $11
- A playground ball that costs $2

First, we add up how much all these things cost together:
- $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Dora has some money:
- $2 from her allowance
- $16 from her mother

So, we add that up too:
- $2 + $16 = $18

Now, to buy all the things, Dora needs:
- $19 - $18 = $1

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy everything. The answer is $1."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. We have four princes: Thaddeus, Arthur, Walter, and Bruce. Thaddeus killed 100 dragons. Arthur killed three quarters of what Thaddeus killed, so that's 75 dragons. Walter killed twice as many as Arthur, so that's 150 dragons. Bruce killed one-fifth as many as Walter, so that's 30 dragons. So, Prince Bruce killed 30 dragons."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. We had 15 gallons of gas and we split it into 5 equal parts. So, each part is 3 gallons. Josey needed a quarter of a container, which is 3/4 of a gallon. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we take 3/4 of 8 pints. That gives us 6 pints. So, Josey needed 6 pints of gas. The answer is 6 pints."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

George spent $5 in total. He had 1 cent left, so he spent $4.95 on chips and candy bars.

He bought 3 bags of chips, and each bag costs 40 cents. So, 3 bags cost 120 cents, which is $1.20.

That means he spent $1.20 on chips. So, the rest of his money, which is $4.95 - $1.20 = $3.75, was spent on candy bars.

Each candy bar costs 75 cents, so the number of candy bars he could buy with $3.75 is $3.75 / $0.75 = 5 candy bars.

So, George bought 5 candy bars. The answer is 5."
"Ray had 25 lollipops and he kept 5 for himself, so he shared the rest. If he shared 20 lollipops among his four friends, how many did each friend get?

To find out, we divide the 20 lollipops by 4 friends:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each friend got 5 lollipops. The answer is 5."
"Rory made a big cake that was 20 ounces. She cut it into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each had one piece. So, they ate 2 pieces. That means 2 pieces times 2.5 ounces each is 5 ounces. So, the cake left over weighs 20 ounces minus the 5 ounces they ate, which is 15 ounces. So, the answer is 15 ounces."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Sitti and Juris have a total of 34 plus 22 oranges, which makes 56 oranges. They're sharing these oranges with 6 of their friends, so that's 8 people in total. If they split the 56 oranges equally among the 8 people, each person would get 7 oranges. So, the answer is 7 oranges per person."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he likes to double that, so he needs 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, so for 4 pounds, it would cost him $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so the beef stock will cost him $4.00.

Adding the cost of the onions and the beef stock, he spends a total of $12.00. His soup serves 6 people, so to find out how much each serving costs, we divide $12.00 by 6. 

So, $12.00 ÷ 6 = $2.00 per serving.

Rounding to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is $2.00.

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater. Bernadette wants to get there 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to figure out how long her drive takes.

The problem says Bernadette's drive takes 4 times as long as Wayne's. So, if Wayne's drive is 4 minutes, then Bernadette's drive is 4 times that, which is 16 minutes.

To get to the theater 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 5 minutes earlier than her 16-minute drive. So, she needs to leave 16 - 5 = 11 minutes before Wayne.

But the question asks how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, and the options given are 12 minutes. So, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne.

The answer is: 12 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Billie's room is 3 yards long, and we know that 1 yard is 3 feet, so the room is 9 feet long. The room is also 40 feet wide because 360 square feet divided by 9 feet (the length) equals 40 feet (the width).

To find the perimeter, we add the length and the width, then multiply by 2. So, 9 feet + 40 feet = 49 feet, and 2 times 49 feet equals 98 feet.

So, the perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet. The answer is 98 feet."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without all the big words.

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Each pack has 20 beads, so:
- Red beads: 1 pack × 20 beads/pack = 20 beads
- Clear beads: 2 packs × 20 beads/pack = 40 beads
- Total beads Elizabeth bought: 20 + 40 = 60 beads

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. Again, each pack has 20 beads, so:
- Blue beads: 3 packs × 20 beads/pack = 60 beads
- Red beads: 4 packs × 20 beads/pack = 80 beads
- Total beads Margareth bought: 60 + 80 = 140 beads

Now, to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
- Margareth's beads: 140
- Elizabeth's beads: 60
- Difference: 140 - 60 = 80 beads

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The answer is 80 beads."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

When Marcus wakes up, the house is 40 degrees. He spends 3 hours in the kitchen baking, and the oven makes the house 5 degrees warmer every hour. So, after 3 hours, the house gets 5 degrees * 3 = 15 degrees warmer. That means the house temperature becomes 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.

Then, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The window makes the house 2 degrees cooler every 10 minutes. So, in 30 minutes, the house gets 2 degrees * 3 = 6 degrees cooler. That means the house temperature becomes 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

So, the final temperature of the house is 49 degrees."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jon swims for 40 minutes, bikes for 1 hour and 20 minutes (which is 80 minutes), and runs for 50 minutes. So, in total, Jon takes 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.

James swims 10% faster, so he swims in 40 minutes * 0.90 = 36 minutes. James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, so that's 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes. 

Now, we know Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 170 + 10 = 180 minutes in total.

If we add up the time James took for swimming, biking, and running, it should be 180 minutes. So, 36 + 85 + running time = 180. That means the running time is 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.

So, James took 59 minutes for the run. The answer is 59 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have Movie C which is 1.25 hours long. First, we need to change that to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is 75 minutes.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 minutes plus 5 minutes, which makes it 80 minutes long.

Now, Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, we take 80 minutes and divide it by 4, which gives us 20 minutes.

So, Movie A is 20 minutes long."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Michael's horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 miles per hour. That means the horse runs 16 miles in that time. For every mile, the horse eats half a bail of hay. So, for 16 miles, the horse eats 16 times half a bail, which is 8 bails of hay.

A bail of hay costs $3. So, 8 bails of hay cost 8 times $3, which is $24.

Michael has 6 five-dollar bills, which is 6 times $5, so that's $30. After buying the hay, he has $30 - $24 = $6 left.

So, the change Michael has is $6. The answer is:

**A. $6**"
"Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs and 2 loose eggs. First, let's find out how many eggs she has in total. She has 4 dozen eggs, and since one dozen is 12 eggs, 4 dozen is 4 times 12, which is 48 eggs. Adding the 2 loose eggs, she has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. So, to find out how many glasses she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each glass needs: 50 eggs ÷ 5 eggs/glass = 10 glasses.

Now, each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold: 10 glasses ÷ 5 glasses/tray = 2 trays.

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog. The answer is 2 trays."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Before Joey played, he had 214 points. He added 26 more points, so his total is now 240 points. Marcy had 225 points and added 10 more, so she now has 235 points. To find out how many more points Joey has than Marcy, we subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points:

240 (Joey's points) - 235 (Marcy's points) = 5 points.

So, Joey is winning by 5 points. The answer is 5."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. He sold 17 of them for $20 each on Monday. So, he made $340 from those 17 sneakers. The rest of the sneakers, which is 31, he sold to a store for $25 each. So, he made $775 from those 31 sneakers.

Now, if we add the money he got from both sales, he made $1115 in total. But he spent $576 to buy the sneakers, so to find out how much money he made, we subtract the cost from the total money he got. 

So, $1115 minus $576 equals $539. 

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539. 

The answer is: **539**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Beatrice bought crayons in two different ways. She got six packets with 8 crayons in each, and four packets with 16 crayons in each.

First, let's count the crayons in the six packets with 8 crayons each:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Then, let's count the crayons in the four packets with 16 crayons each:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add these two numbers together to find out how many crayons Beatrice got in total:
\[ 48 + 64 = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

So, Beatrice got 112 crayons in all. The answer is 112."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Imagine you have two choices:
1. You can buy a super ticket that costs $20 and it comes with a popcorn and a soda. The popcorn and soda together cost $1 extra.
2. Or you can buy a movie ticket for $12 and then buy a popcorn and a soda separately. The popcorn costs $8 and the soda costs $3.

Now, if you save $2 by choosing the super ticket, it means the super ticket is $2 less than buying the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately.

So, if the super ticket is $20 and you saved $2, that means the cost without saving would be $22. But we know the movie ticket is $12, and the popcorn and soda together cost $1 extra, which is $15. So, the popcorn must cost $8 because $12 + $8 + $3 = $23, and $23 - $2 = $21, which matches the super ticket price.

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $8."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

First, we had 20 balloons that cost $900. So, to find out how much each balloon cost, we divide $900 by 20. That gives us $45 for each balloon.

Then, two days later, the price went up by $20. So, each balloon now costs $45 + $20 = $65.

Now, we want to know how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply 170 by $65.

170 times 65 is 10,850.

So, the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price is $10,850.

The answer is: $10,850"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The car drives for 2 hours at 60 miles per hour, so it covers 120 miles. Then it drives for 1 more hour at 30 miles per hour, covering an extra 30 miles. So in total, the car covers 120 miles plus 30 miles, which is 150 miles. The car was on the road for 3 hours in total. To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time. So, 150 miles divided by 3 hours equals 50 miles per hour. Therefore, the car's average speed is 50 miles per hour. The answer is 50 mph."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 of them for 2 rubies. Each sapphire is worth $800, so 3 sapphires are worth 3 times $800, which is $2400. Now she has 5 sapphires left.

The rubies she got are worth $1200 each, so 2 rubies are worth 2 times $1200, which is also $2400.

So, the total value of her sapphires is $4000 (5 sapphires times $800 each), and the total value of her rubies is $2400. Adding these together, the total value of all her jewels is $6400.

So, the answer is $6400."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. So, in 30 days, Marin eats \(4 \times 30 = 120\) apples. Nancy also eats 120 apples in 30 days. Together, they eat \(120 + 120 = 240\) apples.

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is 240. The answer is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Bob has 10 raised beds, and each bed is 8 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall. To find out how much potting soil he needs, we first figure out how much one bed needs. We do this by multiplying the length, width, and height of one bed together:

\[ 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since he has 10 beds, we multiply 32 by 10 to find the total amount of soil he needs:

\[ 32 \times 10 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. To find out how many bags he needs, we divide the total cubic feet by the cubic feet each bag holds:

\[ 320 \div 2 = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost of each bag to find the total cost:

\[ 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

So, the total cost for the potting soil is $1920."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a set of magician cards. There are 15 red cards. The green cards are 60% more than the red cards. So, we take 60% of 15, which is 9, and add that to the 15 red cards to get the number of green cards. That makes it 15 plus 9, which is 24 green cards. The yellow cards are just the total of the red and green cards, so that's 15 red plus 24 green, which is 39 yellow cards. Now, to find out how many cards we have in total, we add up all the cards: 15 red, 24 green, and 39 yellow. That gives us 15 plus 24 plus 39, which equals 78 cards in total. So, the total number of cards is 78."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After 20 minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is 25 fairies, and they joined the 50 fairies. So now there are 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.

Then, 10 minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, 75 - 30 = 45 fairies are left.

So, the number of fairies remaining is 45."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jennifer has 8 puppies, and 3 of them have spots. Brandon has 12 puppies, and 4 of them have spots. So, we have a total of 8 + 12 = 20 puppies. Out of these, 3 + 4 = 7 puppies have spots.

To find out what percentage of all the puppies have spots, we do this:

\[ \frac{7}{20} \times 100 = 35\% \]

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots. The answer is 35%."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The farmer buys:
- 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each 1 pound, so that's 2 pounds.
- 4 bags of carrots, each 12 pounds, so that's 48 pounds.
- 42 bales of hay, each 75 pounds, so that's 3150 pounds.
- 20 sacks of oats, each 65 pounds, so that's 1300 pounds.

Now, if we add all these up:
- Sugar cubes: 2 pounds
- Carrots: 48 pounds
- Hay: 3150 pounds
- Oats: 1300 pounds

Total weight is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. So, to find out how many trips he needs, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
4500 ÷ 2250 = 2 trips.

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to carry all the feed. The answer is 2 trips."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Grayson drinks 3 cans of soda and 5 bottles of water each week. Each soda can is worth 2 cents, and each water bottle is worth 3 cents.

First, let's see how much she gets from the soda cans:
- She drinks 3 cans, and each is 2 cents, so that's 3 times 2 cents, which is 6 cents.

Next, let's see how much she gets from the water bottles:
- She drinks 5 bottles, and each is 3 cents, so that's 5 times 3 cents, which is 15 cents.

Now, let's add those two amounts together:
- 6 cents from the soda cans plus 15 cents from the water bottles equals 21 cents a week.

Now, if we want to know how much she gets in a month, we multiply that by 4:
- 21 cents a week times 4 weeks is 84 cents.

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month. The answer is 84 cents."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know Frederick has 10 plants. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick, so we calculate that Toni has 16 plants. Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so we subtract 7 from 16. That gives us 9 plants. So, Shondra has 9 plants. The answer is 9."
"Leila had $100 and she gave half of that to Ali, so she gave him $50. Ali originally had $21. So, if we add the $50 Leila gave to the $21 Ali had, Ali now has $71.

"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ashley ordered a pizza that costs $15. She wants to give a tip that's 1/5 of what she ordered. So, we need to find out what 1/5 of $15 is.

To find 1/5 of $15, we do:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]
So, the tip is $3.

Now, to find out the total amount Ashley should give, we add the cost of the pizza and the tip together:
\[ 15 + 3 = 18 \]

So, Ashley should give the delivery man $18 in total."
"Oh, alright. Let me walk you through it step by step like I'm not so smart.

Finley starts at the front, which we can think of as 1st place. Then she falls back 5 spots, so she's at 6th place. Then she moves up 2 spots, so she's at 4th place. Then she falls back 3 spots, so she's at 1st place again. And finally, she moves up 1 more spot, so she's at 2nd place.

So, Finley finishes in 2nd place."
"Miss Maria has six decks of basketball cards, and each deck has 25 cards. So, she has 6 times 25 basketball cards, which is 150 basketball cards. She also has five boxes of baseball cards, and each box has 40 cards. So, she has 5 times 40 baseball cards, which is 200 baseball cards. Adding these together, she has 150 basketball cards plus 200 baseball cards, which makes 350 cards in total.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so she gives away 350 minus 50, which is 300 cards. If each of her students gets 10 cards, we can find out how many students she has by dividing the 300 cards by 10 cards per student. So, 300 divided by 10 is 30 students.

Therefore, Miss Maria has 30 students. The answer is 30."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each. So, she spent:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]
But she got a $1 discount, so she paid:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly bought the same 20 apples at 50 cents each. So, she spent:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]
But she got a 10% discount, which is:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]
So, she paid:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:

"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Bob has to do laundry for a big hotel. Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- 4 pillow cases (because it's twice the number of sheets)
- 8 towels (because it's twice the number of pillow cases)

So, in one room, he has to wash:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- 4 pillow cases
- 8 towels

That makes a total of 15 pieces of laundry per room.

Now, if there are 80 rooms, he has to wash:
- 15 pieces of laundry per room
- 80 times

So, he has to wash \(15 \times 80 = 1200\) pieces of laundry.

The final answer is 1200."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs, and since each pair has 2 shoes, that's 5 * 2 = 10 shoes. On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs, which is 15 * 2 = 30 shoes. On Friday, he gets 30 pairs, which is 30 * 2 = 60 shoes.

So, by the end of Friday, he has 200 (original) + 10 (Monday) + 30 (Wednesday) + 60 (Friday) = 300 shoes.

But then on Saturday, he loses 180 shoes. So, 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

So, by Sunday, Fireman Frank has 120 shoes. The answer is 120."
"Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, she can decorate a total of 6 jars times 8 cupcakes per jar, which is 48 cupcakes. Each pan holds 12 cupcakes, so to find out how many pans she needs, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold. That means 48 cupcakes divided by 12 cupcakes per pan equals 4 pans. So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The pen costs $2. The paper costs $1 less than three times the pen. So, three times the pen is $2 times 3, which is $6. Then we take $1 off that, so the paper costs $5.

Now, the pen and the paper together cost $2 + $5 = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10. So, to find out how much change she gets, we take $10 and subtract the $7 she spent. That means $10 - $7 = $3.

"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We start with 30 students, and each has 10 pencils. So, we have 300 pencils in total.

After two months, 1/5 of these pencils are used up. That means 1/5 of 300 pencils is used, which is 60 pencils. So, we have 300 - 60 = 240 pencils left.

At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils are left. So, we take 1/3 of 240 pencils, which is 80 pencils.

So, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

The answer is 80."
"Oh, okay. So Matt wants to eat five cookies. His dad said he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, we need to figure out how many carrot sticks he has to eat.

Let's think about it. If he eats \( x \) carrot sticks, he can have \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \) cookies. We know he wants 5 cookies, so:

\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

Now, let's solve this. First, we subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Then, we multiply both sides by 2 to find \( x \):

\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. That's the answer, right?"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Benny saw a big shark that was 10 feet long. That's the same as 120 inches because 10 times 12 equals 120.

Now, Benny also saw 2 little fish called remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long. So, both remoras together are 12 inches long because 2 times 6 equals 12.

The shark is 120 inches long, and the remoras together are 12 inches long. To find out what percentage the remoras are of the shark, we do this:

\[ \frac{12}{120} \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the remoras are 10% of the shark's length. The answer is 10%.

Here are the options:
A) 5%
B) 10%
C) 15%
D) 20%

The correct answer is B) 10%."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know that if 20 students don't have desktop computers, and that's one-fourth of all the students, then the whole group of students must be four times 20.

"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jason wants to break in his new shoes in three weeks. That's 21 days. He can walk 4 days a week, so that's 21 days too. He needs to walk 240 minutes in total to break in the shoes.

Now, to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day, we divide 240 by 21. 

240 divided by 21 is about 11.43. 

So, Jason needs to walk about 11.43 minutes each day to break in his shoes.

The answer is: **11.43 minutes each day**."
"Sarah spent $300 on books, and each book costs $15. To find out how many books she bought, we divide the total amount by the cost of one book:

\[ 300 \div 15 = 20 \]

So, Sarah bought 20 books. She gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

Each child got 5 books. So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 32 kids in Gina's class. Out of these, 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both.

First, we need to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. To do this, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy to the number allergic to peanuts and then subtract the number allergic to both (because those kids were counted twice).

So, we do it like this:
9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Now, to find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to something from the total number of kids:
32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic to something) = 20 kids.

So, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The company has 3 groups of employees, and each group has 200 people. So, if we add all the employees together, we get:

\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \]

Now, there are also 7 tour guides for each of the 3 groups, so we add the tour guides too:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

So, the total number of people going on the tour is the sum of the employees and the tour guides:

\[ 600 + 21 = 621 \]

So, the total number of people going on the tour is 621."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Tom wants to take his wife on a trip for their anniversary. The plane tickets cost $5000 each, and since he's buying two, that's $10,000 in total for the plane tickets.

The hotel is a bit more expensive because it's a busy weekend. Normally, the hotel costs $1500 a day, but it's 20% more expensive. So, the hotel costs $1500 plus 20% of $1500, which is $1500 + $300 = $1800 a day. They stay for 3 days, so the hotel costs $1800 times 3, which is $5400.

Now, to find the total cost of the trip, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel. So, $10,000 plus $5400 equals $15,400.

So, the total cost of the trip is $15,400."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Ben has 4 blue paint tubes and 3 yellow paint tubes. Jasper has half as many blue paint tubes as Ben, so Jasper has 4 divided by 2, which is 2 blue paint tubes. Jasper also has three times as many yellow paint tubes as Ben, so Jasper has 3 times 3, which is 9 yellow paint tubes. To find out how many paint tubes Jasper has in total, we add the blue and yellow ones together. So, 2 blue tubes plus 9 yellow tubes equals 11 paint tubes in total. Therefore, the answer is 11."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have two pennies. One is from 1959 and the other is from 2010. The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny is a bit lighter, only three-quarters of what the 1959 penny weighs.

So, to find out how much the 2010 penny weighs, we do this:

\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains} \]

Now, to find the total weight of both pennies, we add the weight of the 1959 penny and the 2010 penny together:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

So, the total weight of the two pennies is 84 grains."
"Keegan made $83 and Tashay made $91 by 3 pm. To find out how much more they need to make, we add what they've made and then subtract that from their goal of $200.

So, $83 + $91 = $174. Now, $200 - $174 = $26.

They need to make $26 more to reach their goal. So, the answer is $26."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Gabriel's player can hold 100 songs, and he already has 20 songs on it. So, he can add:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ songs} \]

Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ songs} \]

Luri's player can also hold 100 songs, so he can add:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs} \]

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Stetson and Alec picked 60 oranges. Stetson ate 2/5 of those oranges, which means he ate 24 oranges. For each orange he ate, he had to give Alec $10. So, if he ate 24 oranges, he would give Alec 24 times $10. 

To find out how much money he gave up, we do 24 times 10, which equals 240. So, Stetson gave up $240. 

The answer is: **$240**"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Jillian's shoes cost $80. Now, her handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. So, we first find out what 3 times the cost of her shoes is. That would be 3 times $80, which is $240. Then we take $20 off that, so her handbag costs $220. Therefore, the handbag cost is $220."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James runs 12 miles a day, and he does this for 5 days in a week. So, he runs 12 miles/day × 5 days/week = 60 miles in a week.

Now, he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles by his speed.

So, 60 miles ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours.

Therefore, James runs for 6 hours a week.

The answer is: 6 hours"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Uncle Ben has four horses, and each horse eats 5 pounds of oats twice a day. So, one horse eats 5 times 2, which is 10 pounds a day. Four horses together eat 10 times 4, which is 40 pounds a day.

Now, Uncle Ben wants to feed his horses for 5 days. So, 40 pounds a day times 5 days is 200 pounds in total.

One bag of oats has 50 pounds. To get 200 pounds, we need 200 divided by 50, which is 4 bags.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jana has 27 puppies. Now, two thirds of these puppies are Pomeranians. So, we need to find out how many Pomeranians there are. If we take two thirds of 27, we get:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18 \]

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians. Now, one third of these Pomeranians are girls. So, we need to find out one third of 18:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \]

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians. The answer is 6."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have three places: Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia. The warmest it ever got in Southlandia was -48 degrees. In Northlandia, it got as warm as 21 degrees. And in Midlandia, it only got to -3 degrees.

To find the average, we add these numbers together: -48 + 21 + (-3) = -29. Now, we divide this total by 3 because we have 3 places. So, -29 ÷ 3 = -9.67.

The average highest temperature is about -9.67 degrees Fahrenheit. 

So, the final answer is: -9.67"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4. So, the child needs $12 - $4 = $8 more. The child saves $2 every day. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we divide $8 by $2, which gives us 4 days.

So, it will take the child 4 days to save the money. The answer is 4 days."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jaime has 2 trays, and each tray can hold 24 eggs. So, the trays together can hold 24 times 2, which is 48 eggs. But Jaime has 64 eggs. To find out how many eggs won't fit, we take the number of eggs he has and subtract the number of eggs the trays can hold.

So, 64 minus 48 equals 16. That means 16 eggs won't fit on the trays.

The answer is: **16**"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Sally buys a small pizza for $8 and a family-size pizza that costs three times as much. So, the family-size pizza costs 3 times $8, which is $24. Now, to find out how much she spends in total, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza together. 

So, $8 plus $24 is $32. Therefore, Sally spends $32 in all. The answer is $32."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

First, we have razors that come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack. They're on sale with a ""buy one get one free"" offer. Heather also has a $2.00 coupon. She wants to buy 2 packs of razors.

So, if she buys 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack because of the ""buy one get one free"" offer. That means she pays $4.00 for 4 razors.

Then she uses her $2.00 coupon, so she only pays $2.00 for the 4 razors.

Now, she has 4 razors and she paid $2.00 for them. To find out how much each razor costs, we divide $2.00 by 4.

$2.00 ÷ 4 = $0.50

So, each razor costs $0.50. Since the question asks for the answer in cents, we know that $0.50 is the same as 50 cents.

The answer is 50 cents."
"Okay, let's break it down simply. We have a pyramid with different layers of cheerleaders. The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall. So, that's 4 times 64 inches, which is 256 inches. The next layer up has 3 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, so that's 3 times 64 inches, which is 192 inches. The next layer has 2 cheerleaders, each 64 inches tall, so that's 2 times 64 inches, which is 128 inches. At the top, we have 1 cheerleader who is 60 inches tall.

Now, we add all these heights together:
256 inches (bottom layer) + 192 inches (second layer) + 128 inches (third layer) + 60 inches (top layer) = 636 inches.

To find out how tall this is in feet, we divide by 12 because there are 12 inches in a foot:
636 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 53 feet.

So, the height of the human pyramid is 53 feet. The correct answer is 53 feet."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Charisma works for 8 hours a day. She gets up and walks for 5 minutes every hour she's at work. So, she walks 8 times a day because she works 8 hours. Each time she walks for 5 minutes. 

To find out how many minutes she walks in a day, we multiply the number of times she walks by the time she walks each time:
\[ 8 \text{ walks/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/walk} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, if she does this for 5 days, we multiply the daily minutes by 5:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days, Charisma has walked for a total of 200 minutes. The answer is 200 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Brett is 14 years old now. In four years, he'll be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. The problem says that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. So, if Brett is 14 now, three times that is 36. This means Angela will be 36 in four years. To find out how old she is now, we subtract four years from 36. So, Angela is 36 - 4 = 32 years old now.

The answer is 32."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Paul drives his car twice a day, in the morning and in the afternoon. He does this for 14 days. Each time he drives in the morning, it costs him $6, and each time he drives in the afternoon, it costs him $2.

First, let's count how many times he drives in the morning. Since he drives twice a day, in 14 days, he drives:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ times in the morning} \]

Each time he drives in the morning, it costs $6, so the total cost for the morning rides is:
\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's count how many times he drives in the afternoon. He also drives twice a day, so in 14 days, he drives:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ times in the afternoon} \]

Each time he drives in the afternoon, it costs $2, so the total cost for the afternoon rides is:
\[ 28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much he spent in total, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides:
\[ 168 + 56 = 224 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Paul spent $224 on driving his car during these two weeks. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{224} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each, so that's 50 oranges. Brianne brought 20 more, so that's 70 oranges. Together, they have 120 oranges. Each pie needs 3 oranges, so we divide 120 by 3 to find out how many pies they can make. 

\[ 120 \div 3 = 40 \]

So, they can make 40 greek orange pies. The answer is 40."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. Mark is trying to figure out how many people he should invite to a party so that both places cost the same. 

For the first place, he has to pay $200 no matter how many people come, and each person also costs $5 for food. So, the total cost is $200 plus $5 times the number of people.

For the second place, he also has to pay $25 for each person, and food is already included in that price. So, the total cost is $25 times the number of people.

To make the costs the same, we set up the equation: $200 + $5 times the number of people equals $25 times the number of people. We solve this by saying $200 is the same as $20 times the number of people. So, we get $200 = $20 times the number of people. This means the number of people is 10.

So, Mark needs to invite 10 people for the costs to be the same at both places. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have three friends: Lily, David, and Bodhi. They collected 43 insects together. David found a bit less than Lily, and Lily found more than Bodhi. Bodhi found half as many as David.

So, if we say David found \( D \) insects, then Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects (because she found 7 more than David), and Bodhi found \( D / 2 \) insects (because she found half as many as David).

If we add all these up, we get:
\[ (D + 7) + D + \frac{D}{2} = 43 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2D + 7 + \frac{D}{2} = 43 \]

To make it easier, let's combine the \( D \) terms:
\[ \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} + 7 = 43 \]
\[ \frac{5D}{2} + 7 = 43 \]

Now, let's subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ \frac{5D}{2} = 36 \]

To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 5D = 72 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 5 to find \( D \):
\[ D = 14.4 \]

But wait, we can't have a fraction of an insect, so let's check the closest whole number. If we try \( D = 14 \):
\[ (14 + 7) + 14 + \frac{14}{2} = 21 + 14 + 7 = 42 \]

That's close, but not quite 43. Let's try \( D = 15 \):
\[ (15 + 7) + 15 + \frac{15}{2} = 22 + 15 + 7.5 = 44.5 \]

That's too much. So, \( D = 14 \) seems to be the best fit. If David found 14 insects, then:
- Lily found \( 14 + 7 = 21 \) insects.
- Bodhi found \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) insects.

Adding them up: \( 21 + 14 + 7 = 42 \), which is close to 43. So, Lily found 21 insects.

The number of insects Lily found is 21."
"Mariah used a quarter of a skein of yarn, which is 364 yards divided by 4, so that's 91 yards. Her grandma used half a skein of yarn, which is 364 yards divided by 2, so that's 182 yards. Together, they used 91 yards plus 182 yards, which equals 273 yards. So, the total yards of yarn they used is 273 yards. The answer is 273 yards."
"Cherrie has 5 friends, and 2 of them want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 times 5, which is 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 times 2, which is 6 gifts. So, for her friends, she buys 10 plus 6, which is 16 gifts. Then she decides to buy 10 more gifts as a surprise. So, in total, she buys 16 plus 10, which is 26 gifts. So the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is 26."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a chair that's 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug is 8 feet wide. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. So, twice the width of the rug is 16 feet, and adding 2 feet makes it 18 feet. So, the couch is 18 feet long.

The answer is 18 feet."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Suzie bought four packs of gum. Two of those packs were strawberry flavored, and the other two were grape flavored. She paid $2 for each pack of grape gum. She also bought a small pack of green apple gum, which cost half as much as the grape gum, so that's $1. The total she spent was $7.

Now, if we add up the cost of the grape gum and the green apple gum, that's $2 + $1 = $3. That means the two packs of strawberry gum cost the rest, which is $7 - $3 = $4. Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, each pack must have cost $4 / 2 = $2.

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2."
"Frederick wants to make popsicle sticks and he has $24 to buy wood. He can get more sticks from the 2 x 8 wood because it costs less per stick. 

From the 2 x 4 wood, he can get 6 pieces and each piece gives 200 sticks, so that's 1200 sticks. But from the 2 x 8 wood, he can get 4 pieces and each piece gives 400 sticks, so that's 1600 sticks. 

So, to get the most sticks, he should use the 2 x 8 wood. Therefore, the most sticks he can make is 1600 sticks. 

The answer is: 1600"
"Mario has 6 dogs, and each dog needs a pair of snowshoes. Since each pair costs $12, we need to find out how many pairs he needs to buy for all his dogs.

First, we calculate the total number of pairs of snowshoes needed:
- Mario has 6 dogs.
- Each dog needs 1 pair of snowshoes.
- So, he needs 6 pairs of snowshoes.

Next, we calculate the total cost:
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.
- He needs 6 pairs.
- So, the total cost is 6 pairs times $12 per pair.

Let's do the math:
- 6 pairs × $12 per pair = $72.

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all his dogs is $72. The correct answer is:

\boxed{72}"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Janet takes two bus trips each day, and she does this for 5 days a week. So, she takes 2 times 5, which is 10 bus trips in a week.

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so for 10 trips, it would cost her 10 times $2.20, which is $22.00.

Now, she has a special pass that costs $20 for the whole week. So, to find out how much she saves, we take the total cost of her bus trips and subtract the cost of the pass.

$22.00 (cost of bus trips) - $20.00 (cost of the pass) = $2.00

So, Janet saves $2.00 by buying the pass. The answer is $2.00."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know the farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep. So, the farm has a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.

The zoo has 20 sheep and twice as many cows as the farm, which means 2 * 30 = 60 cows. So, the zoo has a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

Now, to find out how many animals they have together, we add the farm's total to the zoo's total: 40 + 80 = 120.

So, the farm and the zoo have 120 animals combined. The answer is 120."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Sophia and Rose went to the market. Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. Rose bought 4 times what Sophia bought. So, if we think about it, if Rose bought 16 things in total (12 onions and 4 potatoes), and that's 4 times what Sophia bought, then Sophia must have bought half of that.

So, if 16 is 4 times what Sophia bought, then Sophia bought 16 divided by 4, which is 4.

Sophia bought 4 onions and 4 potatoes, making a total of 4 things.

So, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Andy wants to lose 30 pounds by his birthday. To lose one pound, he needs to burn 3500 calories. So, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
\[ 30 \times 3500 = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Now, Andy has to do this in a certain number of days. From December 31st to July 19th, he has 180 days.

To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{180 \text{ days}} = 583.33 \text{ calories/day} \]

So, Andy needs to burn 583.33 calories less than he eats each day to lose 30 pounds by his birthday. The closest answer to 583.33 is 583 calories.

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{583}

"Gerald gets $30 a day and he works for 7 days in a week, so he makes $30 times 7, which is $210. He spent $100. To find out how much he has left, we take the $210 he made and subtract the $100 he spent, which gives us $110 left. So, the answer is $110."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. She's told to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 km. So, if she runs 8 laps, she runs 2 km in total.

Now, for every kilometer she runs, she needs to drink 60 ml of water. So for 2 kilometers, she needs to drink 60 ml plus 60 ml, which is 120 ml.

So, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 120 ml. 

The answer is 120 ml."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Julie started with $500. She first spent 20% on clothes, which is $100. So, she had $500 - $100 = $400 left. Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs, which is $400 * 0.25 = $100. So, after buying the CDs, she had $400 - $100 = $300 left. Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is $300."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Imagine you have a piggy bank, and you put some money in it. Now, let's say the money in the piggy bank (that's the lot) is $30,000. The house is three times as much as the piggy bank, so the house would be $90,000.

If you add the cost of the piggy bank and the house together, you get $120,000, which matches what the question says. So, the house costs $90,000.

The answer is: $90,000"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Tara bought 40 bags at a total cost of $32. She sold each bag for $8, so she made $320 from selling all the bags. To find out how much profit she made, we subtract the cost from the money she got from selling the bags. So, $320 minus $32 equals $288. Therefore, Tara's profit was $288. The answer is $288."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

In a fight, there are 5 rounds, and each round lasts 3 minutes. So, the fight lasts 15 minutes because \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

So, the total number of punches Joe threw is 375."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth of what Suzanne made, so we divide 36 by 4 to find out how many cookies Josh made. 

\[ 36 \div 4 = 9 \]

So, Josh made 9 cookies. Now, Kelsie made twice as many cookies as Josh, so we multiply Josh's cookies by 2.

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies. The answer is 18."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Ali had some money from working for Mr. James. He had four $10 bills and six $20 bills. First, we need to find out how much money he had in total. He had 4 times 10, which is 40, and 6 times 20, which is 120. So, he had 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.

Then, he gave half of that money to his sister. Half of 160 is 80, so he gave 80 dollars to his sister. Now he has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left.

Next, he used 3 out of every 5 dollars he had left to buy dinner. So, he used 3/5 of 80 dollars, which is 3/5 * 80 = 48 dollars.

Now, we subtract the 48 dollars he spent on dinner from the 80 dollars he had left. So, 80 - 48 = 32 dollars.

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is 32 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house, and that's 120 minutes. Now, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double what Rob does. So, first, we find out what double of Rob's time is: 

\[ 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add 40 more minutes to that:

\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house. The answer is 280 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Martha is making clothes for her 3 grandkids. Each grandkid gets a hat, a scarf, a sweater, a pair of mittens, and a pair of socks. Here's how many of each she needs:

- Hats: 3 hats, and each hat uses 2 skeins of wool, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 skeins.
- Scarves: 3 scarves, and each scarf uses 4 skeins of wool, so that's 3 x 4 = 12 skeins.
- Sweaters: 3 sweaters, and each sweater uses 12 skeins of wool, so that's 3 x 12 = 36 skeins.
- Mittens: 3 pairs, and each pair uses 1 skein of wool, so that's 3 x 1 = 3 skeins.
- Socks: 3 pairs, and each pair uses 2 skeins of wool, so that's 3 x 2 = 6 skeins.

Now, if we add all these up: 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63 skeins of wool. So, Martha needs to buy 63 skeins of wool."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Chris has 100 math problems to do. On Monday, he does 12. On Tuesday, he does three times as many as Monday, so that's 36 problems. So by Tuesday, he's done 12 + 36 = 48 problems.

Now, he has 100 - 48 = 52 problems left. On Wednesday, he does one-quarter of the remaining problems, which is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.

So after Wednesday, he has 52 - 13 = 39 problems left to do.

The number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is 39."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries in an hour. Bobby picks one less than Tony, so that's 5 quarts. Kathy can pick twice as much as Bobby, so that's 10 quarts. Ricky picks 2 less than Kathy, so that's 8 quarts.

Now, if we add all these up: 6 (Tony) + 5 (Bobby) + 10 (Kathy) + 8 (Ricky) = 29 quarts.

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries they can pick in an hour is 29."
"Sure, let me explain it in a simpler way.

They baked 200 loaves of bread. They sold 93 in the morning and 39 in the afternoon. That's 93 + 39 = 132 loaves sold in total. So, they had 200 - 132 = 68 loaves left. Then, a grocery store gave them 6 more loaves. So, they had 68 + 6 = 74 loaves left.

The number of loaves of bread they had left is 74."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Jackson has 36 red tulips and he can plant 6 red tulips in a row. So, he can plant 36 / 6 = 6 rows of red tulips. He also has 24 blue tulips and can plant 8 blue tulips in a row. So, he can plant 24 / 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips. If he plants both red and blue tulips, he can plant 6 rows of red plus 3 rows of blue, which makes 6 + 3 = 9 rows in total. So, the total number of rows Jackson will plant is 9."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Heather has a big bag of raisins with 27 cups. She wants to make cookies, granola, and snack mix, and she wants to share the raisins equally. So, she takes 27 cups and divides them into 3 parts. That means each part gets 9 cups of raisins.

Now, to make one batch of cookies, she needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. So, to find out how many batches she can make, we divide the raisins she has for cookies by the amount needed for one batch.

So, she has 9 cups for cookies, and each batch needs 3/4 cup. To find out how many batches she can make, we do:

\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of cookies. The answer is 12."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ada uses 12 kilowatts of electricity each day. She's going to add a new thing that uses 2 kilowatts of electricity each day. So, she'll use 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts of electricity each day after she adds the new thing.

Now, if she uses 14 kilowatts each day, she'll use 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts in a week. Since electricity costs $1.50 for each kilowatt, the cost for a week will be 98 * $1.50 = $147.

Before she adds the new thing, she uses 12 kilowatts each day, so in a week, she uses 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts. The cost for a week will be 84 * $1.50 = $126.

So, the difference in her bill will be $147 - $126 = $21.

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $21."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

If one person can paint half a house in 5 days, that means they paint half a house in one day. So, if we have 5 people working together, they can paint 5 times as much in one day. That means in one day, 5 people can paint 5 times half a house, which is a whole house.

So, it would take them 5 days to paint a whole house. Now, we need to know how many hours that is. There are 24 hours in a day, so 5 days would be 5 times 24 hours, which is 120 hours.

So, the answer is 120 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Ophelia has 20 sofas. She has 2 more chairs than sofas, so she has 22 chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so she has 3 times 22, which is 66 chairs. Jenna also has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, so she has 66 - 2 = 64 sofas.

Now, to find out the total number of sofas and chairs they both have, we add up all the sofas and chairs:

- Ophelia's sofas: 20
- Ophelia's chairs: 22
- Jenna's sofas: 64
- Jenna's chairs: 66

So, the total number of sofas is 20 + 64 = 84.
And the total number of chairs is 22 + 66 = 88.

Adding these together, we get 84 + 88 = 172.

So, the total number of sofas and chairs they have together is 172."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Tom had $48 to spend. He bought a CD for $4, so he had $44 left for the headphone set. With $44, he could buy 11 more CDs because each CD costs $4.

Now, if he didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $48. With $48, he could buy 12 CDs because each CD costs $4.

So, if he didn't buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 1 more CD. The answer is:

1 more CD"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Josh worked out for 4 hours every week for 6 weeks. That's 4 hours times 6 weeks, which is 24 hours.

Then, for 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So that's 5 hours times 2 weeks, which is 10 hours.

And for 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Now, if we add all these up: 24 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours equals 40 hours.

So, Josh worked out for a total of 40 hours over the 8 weeks. The answer is 40 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We start with 48 people on the bus. At the first stop, 8 people get off, so we have:
\[ 48 - 8 = 40 \]
Then, 5 times as many people as those who got off get on, so:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]
So, we add 40 more people to the bus:
\[ 40 + 40 = 80 \]
At the second stop, 21 people get off, so we have:
\[ 80 - 21 = 59 \]
Then, 3 times fewer people get on, which means:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \]
So, we add 7 more people to the bus:
\[ 59 + 7 = 66 \]

So, after the second stop, there are 66 people on the bus. The final answer is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without all the numbers.

Jame is going to be 27 years old in 5 years. That means he is 22 years old now. His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years. So, in 8 years, Jame will be 30 years old. Twice that age is 60, and 5 years younger than that is 55. So, his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, which means his cousin is 47 now. The difference in their ages is 47 - 22, which is 25 years. So, the age difference between Jame and his cousin is 25 years."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400. The computer cost $1,100, and the printer cost $400 less than the computer. So, the printer cost $700.

Now, if we add up the cost of the computer and the printer, that's $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. That means the two monitors cost $2,400 - $1,800 = $600. Since he bought 2 monitors, one monitor would cost $600 ÷ 2 = $300.

So, the cost of one monitor is $300."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. There were 20 kids going on a trip. Half of them were boys and half were girls, so there were 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys each found 60 seashells. Now, the girls found more seashells than the boys. They found as many as the boys plus four times as many as the boys. So, each girl found 60 (like the boys) plus 4 times 60, which is 240. That means each girl found 60 + 240 = 300 seashells.

So, the number of seashells each girl brought back is 300."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

So, George had 3 candies left after eating 5. That means before he ate the candies, he had 3 + 5 = 8 candies. Nick had twice as many candies as George, so Nick had 2 times 8, which is 16 candies. So, Nick had 16 candies."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Chenny is 10 years old. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so Alyana is 6 years old. Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so Anne is 8 years old. 

So, Anne is 8 years old. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have four books, and we need to find out how thick they are all together.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so it's 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 × 31 mm = 62 mm thick.

Now, to find the total thickness, we add all these together:
31 mm + 50 mm + 45 mm + 62 mm = 188 mm

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm."
"Emma makes 72 vlogs in a month. So far, she has made 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs. To reach her goal, she needs to make 72 - 54 = 18 more vlogs. So, she should make 18 vlogs to complete her goal. The answer is 18."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. My wife wants to split the $50 dinner bill evenly, but she also wants me to add 20% more for the tip. So, first, we need to find out what 20% of $50 is. 

To find 20% of $50, we do:
\[ 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]
So, the tip is $10.

Now, we add the tip to the original bill:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, I ended up paying $60 in total."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

First, we have $18 to share among 3 boys. So, each boy gets $6.

The eldest boy gets $6 and then adds $5 more, so he has $6 + $5 = $11.

The next day, he adds another $10, so he has $11 + $10 = $21.

Then, he spends $8, so he has $21 - $8 = $13 left.

After that, he triples the $13 he has, so he gets $13 × 3 = $39.

So, the final amount he has is $39."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. He wants to save twice as much in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. April has 30 days, so the first half has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

If he saves $25 in the first half, then in the second half he saves $50 because it's twice as much. 

Now, to find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, we do this:

Total savings in the second half = $50
Number of days in the second half = 15

So, savings per day in the second half = Total savings in the second half / Number of days in the second half
= $50 / 15
= $3.33 (rounded to two decimal places)

But the question asks for the exact amount, so we say he needs to save $33.33 each day in the second half of the month.

Now, if I had to pick from the given options, the closest one would be $33.33, but since the options aren't given in the question, I'll just say he needs to save $33.33 each day in the second half of the month.

So, the answer is: $33.33"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Verna bought some fruits and we need to find out how much money she got back after paying with $20.

First, she bought apples. She got 3 apples at $1.50 each. So, 3 times $1.50 is $4.50.

Then, she bought oranges. She got 5 oranges at $0.80 each. So, 5 times $0.80 is $4.00.

Next, she bought peaches. She got 6 peaches at $0.75 each. So, 6 times $0.75 is $4.50.

Now, we add up all the fruits:
$4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to buy all these fruits. So, to find out how much change she got, we take $20 and subtract the $13 she spent:
$20 - $13 = $7

So, Verna got $7 back as change. If we had to pick from the choices, the answer would be $7."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without all the big words.

Jairus gets $0.8 for each task he does. If he does 20 tasks, he gets:
\[ 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny gets $0.5 for each task she does. If she does 20 tasks, she gets:
\[ 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus gets than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's money from Jairus's money:
\[ 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jairus gets $6 more than Jenny. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Jeff and Brad are splitting 100 dollars. Brad gets some money, and Jeff gets four times as much as Brad. If we say Brad gets \( B \) dollars, then Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars. The total is 100 dollars, so we have \( B + 4B = 100 \). This simplifies to \( 5B = 100 \). To find out how much Brad gets, we divide 100 by 5, which gives us 20 dollars. So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Now, since Jeff gets four times what Brad gets, we multiply 20 by 4, which gives us 80 dollars. Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars."
"Well, if Jeff has to walk 3 miles to his work and 3 miles back home each day, that makes 6 miles a day. If he works 5 days a week, then he walks 6 miles times 5 days, which is 30 miles. So, the total miles Jeff walks in a week is 30 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Elise is writing the alphabet. She writes it all out twice, so that's 26 letters times 2, which is 52 letters. Then she writes half of the alphabet, which is 13 letters. So far, she's written 52 + 13 = 65 letters. But then she writes everything she's already written again. She's already written 52 + 13 = 65 letters, and she writes those 65 letters again. So she writes 65 more times 2, which is 130 letters. But wait, she already wrote those 65 letters, so we don't count them again. So she writes 65 more times 1, which is 65 letters. Now, add all that up: 52 (first two alphabets) + 13 (half alphabet) + 65 (everything she's already written again) = 129 letters.

So, Elise wrote 129 letters in total."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine Ali starts by calling 3 families. Then, each of those 3 families calls 3 more families. So, in the second round, 3 families each call 3 more, making it 3 times 3, which is 9 families.

Now, those 9 families each call 3 more families. So, in the third round, 9 families each call 3 more, making it 9 times 3, which is 27 families.

Finally, those 27 families each call 3 more families. So, in the fourth round, 27 families each call 3 more, making it 27 times 3, which is 81 families.

So, the number of families notified during the fourth round is 81."
"Okay, let me think this through. Mark was sick for 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month. So, he lost 10 pounds times 3 months, which is 30 pounds. If his final weight was 70 pounds, then before he got sick, he must have weighed 70 pounds plus the 30 pounds he lost. So, his initial weight was 70 pounds plus 30 pounds, which is 100 pounds. Therefore, the initial weight was 100 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James has 80 toys in his play set. If we want a play set that's five times bigger, that means we need 5 times 80 toys, which is 400 toys.

Now, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to get to 400 toys. So, if we take 400 and subtract 2, we get the number of toys Jonathan has.

So, 400 minus 2 is 398. That means Jonathan has 398 toys.

The answer is \(\boxed{398}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Daniel wants to buy:
- 5 notebooks at $1.50 each, so that's 5 * $1.50 = $7.50
- 2 pens at $0.25 each, so that's 2 * $0.25 = $0.50
- 1 calculator at $12
- 1 geometry set at $10

Now, let's add all these up:
$7.50 + $0.50 + $12 + $10 = $20

The shop gives a 10% discount on everything, so we need to find out what 10% of $20 is:
10% of $20 = 0.10 * $20 = $2

Now, we take $2 off the total:
$20 - $2 = $18

So, Daniel has to spend $18 on all the items. The answer is $18."
"Okay, let me break it down simply. Carly buys five hamburgers at $4 each, so that's $20. She also buys ten packs of potato fries at $0.30 each, making it $3. Lastly, she gets five cans of fruit drinks at $2 each, which is $10. Adding all these up, she spends $20 + $3 + $10 = $33. Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so the change she gets back is $50 - $33 = $17. So, the change Carly gets back is $17."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Antonella sold a lot of stuff worth $2500. For the first $1000, she gets 30% of that, which is $300. For the rest, which is $1500, she gets an extra 10%, so that's $150. If we add those two amounts together, she gets $300 + $150 = $450. So, Antonella earned $450."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Bill already has 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he has 2 times 24 bottles, which is 48 bottles.

He's having a party for 70 people, and he wants to give each person 2 bottles of water. So, he needs 70 times 2 bottles, which is 140 bottles in total.

He already has 48 bottles, so he needs 140 minus 48 more bottles. That means he needs 92 more bottles.

So, the answer is 92 bottles."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ray swims a mile in cold water in 16 minutes. In warm water, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. So, first, we find out how long it takes him in warm water:

- Twice the time in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to that gives us \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

Now, if Ray swims 3 miles, in cold water it would take him \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes. In warm water, it would take him \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes him in warm water, we subtract the cold water time from the warm water time: \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day. The answer is 54 minutes."
"John gets paid $2 for each hour he works. He works 5 hours a day and does this for 4 days in a week. So, in one week, he makes:

\[ 2 \times 5 \times 4 = 40 \, \text{dollars} \]

He wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide $80 by his weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{80}{40} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80. The answer is 2 weeks."
"Oh, okay. So you want to know how much I spend on lunch today at Subway. Well, I get a foot-long fish sub that costs $40. And for the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, it costs three times as much as the fish sub. So that's three times $40, which is $120. Now, if I add the cost of both subs together, it's $40 plus $120, which makes $160. So, I spend $160 on lunch today."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We had a bag with 21 buttons. Out of these, 7 buttons had two holes each, and the rest had four holes each.

First, we find out how many buttons had four holes. We do this by subtracting the 7 buttons with two holes from the total of 21 buttons:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]
So, 14 buttons had four holes each.

Next, we calculate the total holes from the buttons with two holes:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]
That's 14 holes from the buttons with two holes.

Then, we calculate the total holes from the buttons with four holes:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]
That's 56 holes from the buttons with four holes.

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons together:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons is 70. The answer is 70."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches big. Zack's locker is half that size, so it's 12 cubic inches. Peter's locker is a quarter of what Zack's locker is, so it's 3 cubic inches. That's how big Peter's locker is."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Imagine there's a rule that says you should drink 8 cups of coffee a day. Octavia drinks half of that, so she drinks 4 cups. Her husband Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks, so he drinks 40 cups of coffee a day.

But his doctor says he should only drink 4 cups a day. So, Juan needs to cut down from 40 cups to 4 cups. To find out how many cups he needs to cut, we do 40 minus 4, which gives us 36 cups.

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups. The answer is 36."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The pet shop had 6 cages. In 3 of those cages, there were 10 hamsters each. So, that's 3 times 10, which is 30 hamsters. In the other 3 cages, there were 5 guinea pigs each. So, that's 3 times 5, which is 15 guinea pigs.

Now, to find out how many rodents there are in total, we add the hamsters and the guinea pigs together. So, 30 hamsters plus 15 guinea pigs equals 45 rodents.

So, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so she weighs 130 pounds. Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 260 pounds.

Now, to find the average weight, we add up all their weights and then divide by the number of people, which is 3.

So, 150 (Mark) + 130 (Susan) + 260 (Bob) = 540 pounds.

To find the average, we divide 540 by 3:
\[ 540 \div 3 = 180 \]

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds. The answer is 180."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine the great pyramids are like big hills. When you stand at the entrance, you can see the top of the pyramid at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. That's like looking up at a big hill.

Now, the sun is like a ball moving up in the sky. It starts at the top of the pyramid, which is like the very top of the hill. The sun moves up the sky at a rate of 5 degrees every hour. So, if it moves for 10 hours, it would move up by 50 degrees.

So, if we add the 32 degrees from the ground to the 50 degrees the sun moved up, we get 82 degrees.

So, the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees. 

The answer is: **82 degrees**."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. James has two sons. One is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 8 years old. That means James needs 12 candles for the 12-year-old and 8 candles for the 8-year-old, making a total of 20 candles.

Now, a pack of 5 candles costs $3. To get 20 candles, James needs 4 packs because 20 divided by 5 is 4. Each pack costs $3, so 4 packs cost 4 times $3, which is $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles. The answer is $12."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Judy read for 15 minutes each night for a week, which is 15 minutes times 7 nights, so that's 105 minutes. Now, if she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we can figure out how many pages she reads in 1 minute by dividing 2 by 1.5, which gives us about 1.33 pages per minute. So, in 105 minutes, she reads 105 times 1.33 pages, which is about 139 pages. In the second week, she read 100 pages. So, in two weeks, she read 139 pages plus 100 pages, which is 239 pages. 

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 239 pages. 

The answer is: **239 pages**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches. Cody ate a third of them, so he ate 4 sandwiches. Trevor ate a quarter of them, so he ate 3 sandwiches. Now, we need to find out how many sandwiches are left.

Cody ate 4, and Trevor ate 3, so together they ate 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches. That means 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches are left.

So, the number of sandwiches left is 5."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know Shiloh is 44 years old now. In 7 years, he'll be 51 years old. At that time, he'll be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let his nephew's age in 7 years be \( x + 7 \), then we have:

\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Solving this, we get:

\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, his nephew is 10 years old now."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for each of the next three teeth, she gave $1.00 each time. So that's $1.00 for the second tooth, $1.00 for the third tooth, and $1.00 for the fourth tooth. That's $1.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $3.00. For the last two teeth, she gave half the amount of $1.00, which is $0.50 each. So that's $0.50 for the fifth tooth and $0.50 for the sixth tooth. That's $0.50 + $0.50 = $1.00. Now, let's add it all up: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00. So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have three friends playing soccer. Richie scored 80 goals. He scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals. Richie also scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals. Now, to find out how many goals all three scored together, we add up their goals: 80 (Richie) + 35 (Anna) + 60 (Mark) = 175 goals. So, the total number of goals scored by all three friends is 175."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each, so he made 84 dollars. Liam said he made 63 dollars. To find out how much more Mitchell made, we subtract Liam's money from Mitchell's money. So, 84 dollars minus 63 dollars equals 21 dollars. Mitchell made 21 dollars more than Liam. So, the answer is 21 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Peter starts with $70 and wants to spend the same amount each day for a week. That means he spends $10 each day.

From Sunday to Wednesday, he buys wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5. He can buy 4 wooden action figures because 4 times $5 is $20, and that's how much he spends in 4 days.

For Thursday to Sunday, he buys plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2. He can buy 4 plastic action figures because 4 times $2 is $8, and that's how much he spends in the other 4 days.

So, by the end of the week, he has 4 wooden action figures and 4 plastic action figures. That makes a total of 8 action figures.

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 8."
"Okay, let me break it down simply. Leah had to pay $200 to spay her kitten. For the vaccines, she paid $20 for each of the 3 vaccines, so that's $20 times 3, which is $60. The kitten broke 4 vases, and each vase cost $12 to replace, so that's $12 times 4, which is $48. Now, if we add all these costs together: $200 for spaying, $60 for the vaccines, and $48 for the broken vases, we get $200 + $60 + $48 = $308. So, the total cost for the kitten is $308."
"Ford grows 40 roses every week. The first shop orders 20, the second 15, and the third 30. So, in total, the shops order 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses a week. Ford only grows 40 roses a week, so he's short by 65 - 40 = 25 roses each week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so in a month, he's short by 25 * 4 = 100 roses. So, the answer is 100 roses."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Katina starts with $3000 in her savings. She takes out $100 every month. We need to know how much she has left after 2 years.

First, we find out how many months are in 2 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Katina takes out $100 each month, so in 24 months, she takes out:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we take the $3000 she started with and subtract the $2400 she took out:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after 2 years, Katina has $600 left in her savings account. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The food truck makes grilled cheeses. They buy bread for $3.00 and can make 10 sandwiches with one loaf. They spend $30.00 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches. They sell each sandwich for $7.00.

First, they spend $3.00 on bread for 10 sandwiches. Then, they spend $30.00 on cheese and stuff for 10 sandwiches. So, in total, they spend $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00 to make 10 sandwiches.

Now, they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so they make $7.00 * 10 = $70.00.

To find out how much money they have left after making the sandwiches, we subtract the money they spent from the money they made: $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.

So, their net profit is $37.00."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. Kate had 3 boxes of crayons, and each box had 64 crayons. So, she had 192 crayons in total. She wanted to make crayon muffins, and to make one muffin, she needed 8 crayon pieces. So, she could make 24 muffins. If she sells each muffin for $1.50, then she can make 24 times $1.50. Let's do the math: 24 times 1.50 equals 36. So, Kate can make $36. The answer is 36."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simple way.

First, we find out how big Michael's bedroom is. It's 18 feet by 12 feet, so we multiply those numbers to get the area:
\[ 18 \times 12 = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we figure out how much the new carpet costs. The carpet costs $12 per square foot, and we need 216 square feet:
\[ 12 \times 216 = 2592 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we add the cost of the padding, which is $2 per square foot:
\[ 2 \times 216 = 432 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the carpet and padding is:
\[ 2592 + 432 = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to pay to take out the old carpet. The old carpet costs $4 per square foot:
\[ 4 \times 216 = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we add the cost to put in the new carpet, which is $34 per square foot:
\[ 34 \times 216 = 7344 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total cost, we add all these amounts together:
\[ 3024 + 864 + 7344 = 11232 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:
\[ \boxed{11232} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mack saw birds over 7 days. On the first two days, he saw 50 birds in total. On the third day, he saw none. On the fourth and fifth days, he saw 120 birds. On the sixth day, he saw 20 birds, and on the seventh day, he saw 90 birds.

To find out how many birds he saw on average each day, we need to add up all the birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

So, 50 (first day) + 0 (second day) + 0 (third day) + 120 (fourth day) + 120 (fifth day) + 20 (sixth day) + 90 (seventh day) = 380 birds in total.

Now, we have 7 days, so we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
\[ \frac{380}{7} = 54.2857 \]

When we talk about average birds seen per day, we usually round to the nearest whole number, so it's about 54 birds per day.

The closest number to 54 from the options given is 54.

So, the answer is 54."
"Okay, let me walk you through it step by step like I'm not so smart.

First, Diane starts with a number 20. She adds half of 20 to 20. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 10 to 20 to get 30.

Next, she takes that 30 and divides it by 5. So, 30 divided by 5 is 6.

Finally, she takes that 6 and multiplies it by the starting number minus 12. The starting number is 20, so 20 minus 12 is 8. Then she multiplies 6 by 8, which gives her 48.

So, the final value of the number train is 48."
"Okay, let me think about this like I'm not so smart.

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards, so that's 5 minus 3, which is 2 cards.

Now, to find out how many cards they have together, we add the boy's cards to his brother's cards. So, 5 plus 2 is 7.

So, they have 7 cards together. The answer is 7."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Maggie's oven is not working right. When she sets it to 450 degrees, it actually gets to 468 degrees. That means it's off by 4 degrees out of 450 degrees, which is 4%. Now, if her recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to find out what temperature she should set the oven to so that it gets to 520 degrees.

To find this, we know that for every 100 degrees she sets the oven, it actually gets to 96 degrees. So, if she wants 520 degrees, we can set up a simple math problem:

\[ \text{Oven setting} = \frac{520}{0.96} \]

Doing the division:

\[ \text{Oven setting} = 541.67 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to about 541.67 degrees to get 520 degrees in her recipe. The closest option would be 542 degrees.

So, the answer is 542 degrees."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Max wants to watch two movies. The first one is 1 hour and 30 minutes, and the second one is 2 hours and 5 minutes. We need to add these times together to know how long Max will be watching.

First, let's break it down:
- 1 hour and 30 minutes is the same as 90 minutes.
- 2 hours and 5 minutes is the same as 125 minutes.

Now, we add these two times:
- 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.

So, Max will spend 215 minutes watching the two movies. The answer is 215 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Herb bought his house for $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less than that, so we need to find out what 30% of $76,000 is. 

30% of $76,000 is $22,800. So, Juan's house cost $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.

Now, to find out the total value of both houses, we add Herb's house and Juan's house together. 

So, $76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200.

The total value of the two houses combined is $129,200."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Judy bought 12 cups and twice as many dishes, so she got 24 dishes. Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than cups, so that's 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.

Now, we add up all the cups and dishes:

- Judy's cups: 12
- Judy's dishes: 24
- Friend's cups: 40
- Friend's dishes: 60

So, the total number of cups is 12 + 40 = 52.
And the total number of dishes is 24 + 60 = 84.

Adding these together, we get 52 cups + 84 dishes = 136 utensils.

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 136."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have contacts that come in boxes. Each box has 90 contacts and lasts for 45 days. But we're not using them for 45 days, we're using them for 1 day, so each box lasts for 90 days.

Now, each box costs $100, but there's a 10% discount. So, the discount is $100 times 10%, which is $10. So, the box costs $90 after the discount.

If Pete buys 2 boxes, that's 2 times $90, which is $180.

Now, we have 180 contacts in 2 boxes. If we use 1 contact per day, these contacts will last for 180 days. But we're only interested in how much each contact costs. Since 180 contacts cost $180, each contact costs $180 divided by 180, which is $1.

So, the cost per pair of contacts is $1. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply without all the numbers.

Tabitha paid John and Jill to help clean out her attic and basement. They both get paid $10 for each hour they work.

Jill worked for 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. So, she worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday. On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, so that's 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday. So, John worked a total of 4 + 3 = 7 hours.

Now, if they both get $10 for each hour, Jill's total pay is 3 hours * $10/hour = $30. John's total pay is 7 hours * $10/hour = $70.

So, John earned more than Jill. To find out how much more, we subtract Jill's pay from John's pay: $70 - $30 = $40.

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The answer is $40."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Hannah does aerobics for 2 hours and running for 1 hour. Aerobics burns 500 calories an hour, so in 2 hours, that's 1000 calories. Running burns 600 calories in 1 hour, so in 1 hour, that's 600 calories.

So, in total, she burns 1000 calories from aerobics and 600 calories from running, which makes 1600 calories total.

Now, she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, for 1600 calories, she needs to drink:

\[ \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml} \]

So, she needs to drink 800 ml of water. The answer is 800 ml."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Imagine we have a big jar of jelly beans. The note on the jar says there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones and 1% fewer red ones than blue ones. We know the jar has 4500 jelly beans in total.

If we say there are 1500 blue jelly beans, then:
- The red jelly beans would be 1% less than 1500, which is 1485.
- The green jelly beans would be 1% more than 1500, which is 1515.

Now, to find out how many more green jelly beans there are than red ones, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:
1515 - 1485 = 30

So, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red ones. The answer is 30."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jared started typing at 47 words per minute (WPM). Then he got better and could type 52 WPM. If he keeps getting better and types 5 more words, he'll be at 57 WPM.

Now, we need to find the average of these three speeds: 47, 52, and 57.

First, we add these numbers together:
47 + 52 + 57 = 156

Then, we divide the total by 3 to find the average:
156 ÷ 3 = 52

So, the average of the three speeds is 52 WPM.

The answer is 52."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he loses 1.25 pounds each week. Over 5 weeks, he would lose:
\[ 1.25 \times 5 = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \]

If he eats donuts every day, he gains 1.75 pounds each week. Over 5 weeks, he would gain:
\[ 1.75 \times 5 = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find out how much more he gains compared to losing, we subtract the weight loss from the weight gain:
\[ 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, at the end of 5 weeks, Martin would weigh 2.5 pounds more if he eats donuts instead of Cheerios. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{2.5}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Alex starts by inviting 100 people. Each of those 100 people invites 2 more friends, so that's 100 times 2, which is 200 more people. Then, Alex calls 10 of her friends, and 8 of those friends bring their spouses. So, we add Alex herself, the 100 people she invited, the 200 friends invited by those 100, the 10 friends Alex called, and the 8 spouses. That makes a total of 319 people coming to the event. So, Alex needs 319 seats."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have four dogs in a line. The first one is a little dog called Affenpinscher, and he weighs 10 pounds. The next dog is a Dachshund, and it weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. So, the Dachshund weighs 20 pounds. The next dog is a Papillon, and it weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so that's 5 pounds. The last dog is a Mastiff, and it weighs 44 times as much as the Papillon, so that's 220 pounds.

So, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Marilyn wants to buy some boots. On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and the shipping is $4. So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Now, on eBay, the boots cost $13 and the shipping is twice as much as on Amazon. So, the shipping on eBay is $4 x 2 = $8. The total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Now, to find out how much more expensive it is on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay. So, $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots cost $1 more on eBay. The answer is that the boots cost $1 more on eBay."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles every day. So, on the first day, it's 4 feet. On the second day, it doubles to 8 feet. On the third day, it doubles again to 16 feet. And on the fourth day, it doubles to 32 feet.

Mark's window is 20 feet high. So, the beanstalk is taller than the window on the fourth day because it reaches 32 feet, which is more than 20 feet.

So, it takes 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window. The answer is 4 days."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how much protein he gets in a week, we first figure out how much protein he gets in one day.

If 100 grams have 3 grams of protein, then 200 grams will have double that, which is 6 grams of protein. So, John gets 6 grams of protein each day. Now, to find out how much he gets in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (the number of days in a week).

So, 6 grams/day × 7 days/week = 42 grams/week.

The answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, we have Jerry and we know he's twice as old as he was 5 years ago. That means if we take his age now and subtract 5, then double that number, we get his current age. So if we say Jerry's age now is \( J \), then:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

If we solve this, we get:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is 10 years old now. If we want to know how old he'll be in 3 years, we just add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants, and each one costs $2000. So, for the implants, it's $2000 times 2, which is $4000. One of the implants needs a special crown that costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the implants and the special crown is $4000 plus $500, which is $4500.

George already put down a deposit of $600. So, he still needs to pay $4500 minus $600, which is $3900.

George makes $15 for each hour he works. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide $3900 by $15, which gives us 260 hours.

So, George needs to work 260 hours to pay for the dental work. The answer is 260 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down simply. We have a triangle where one angle is twice the smallest angle, and another angle is three times the smallest angle. We know that all angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.

So, if we let the smallest angle be \( x \), then the other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( 3x \). Adding these up, we get:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[ x = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

And the angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. So, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Colby has different types of coins. He has 8 quarters, 6 dimes, 14 nickels, and 15 pennies. Let's count how much money he has in total.

- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add all the cents together:
200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs he can buy, we divide the total cents by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents ÷ 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs. The answer is 69."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have some pets in the store. There are 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 10 birds. Each dog has 4 legs, each cat has 4 legs, and each bird has 2 legs.

First, let's count the legs of the dogs:
- 5 dogs × 4 legs = 20 legs

Next, let's count the legs of the cats:
- 2 cats × 4 legs = 8 legs

Then, let's count the legs of the birds:
- 10 birds × 2 legs = 20 legs

Now, we add all these together:
- 20 legs (dogs) + 8 legs (cats) + 20 legs (birds) = 48 legs

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He adds 50% to that, so he gets 12 pounds. But that's too heavy, so he takes off 2 pounds. So, he ends up with 10 pounds. That's the weight he's using now."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easy to understand.

Steve starts with 5 games on his birthday. Then, for the first year, he buys 1 game each month for 12 months, so he gets 12 more games. That makes a total of 5 + 12 = 17 games.

Next year, he buys 2 games each month for 12 months, so he gets 24 more games. Adding those to the 17 games he already has, he has 17 + 24 = 41 games. He also gets 5 more games for Christmas, so he has 41 + 5 = 46 games.

In the third year, he buys 4 games each month for 12 months, so he gets 48 more games. Adding those to the 46 games he already has, he has 46 + 48 = 94 games. He also gets 5 more games for Christmas, so he has 94 + 5 = 99 games.

So, after 3 years, Steve has 99 games. The answer is 99."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. So, to find out how fast it goes, we divide the miles by the hours it took. That means it goes 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

Now, if we want to know how long it would take to go 2000 miles at this speed, we divide the miles we want to go by the speed. So, 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

So, it would take 5 more hours to travel 2000 miles. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. So, in 1 hour, he makes half of that, which is 60 pounds. Marissa makes 3/4 as much as Ruiz in an hour, so she makes 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds in an hour.

Now, if they both work for 12 hours, Ruiz makes 60 * 12 = 720 pounds, and Marissa makes 45 * 12 = 540 pounds.

So, together they make 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds of chocolates.

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1260 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Howard starts with $100. On Monday, he spends $8. So, he has $100 - $8 = $92 left.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday, so he spends $8 * 2 = $16. Now he has $92 - $16 = $76 left.

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times what he spent on Tuesday, so he spends $16 * 4 = $64. Now he has $76 - $64 = $12 left.

So, Howard has $12 left. The answer is $12."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way.

Patrick sold lemonade for 6 hours. For the first 4 hours, he sold 15 cups of lemonade each hour at $0.50 per cup. So, for 4 hours, he sold:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]
And he sold each cup for $0.50, so:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30.00 \]

For the next 2 hours, he sold 10 cups of lemonade each hour at $0.60 per cup. So, for 2 hours, he sold:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]
And he sold each cup for $0.60, so:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12.00 \]

Now, if we add the money he made from both parts:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

So, Patrick earned $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this like I'm not so smart.

First, we know that for every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. So, to find out how many times the tires rotate in a month, we do this:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

Now, for 400 miles:

\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

The tires can go up to 10,440,000 rotations. To find out how many months it takes for the tires to reach that number:

\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we divide 72 months by 12 to find out how many years:

\[ \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The answer is 6 years."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a big bottle of shampoo that costs $24.00. The bottle says you can get 120 washes with 2 pumps. If you only use 1 pump for each wash, how much does each pump cost in cents?

First, we find out how many washes you get from 1 pump. Since 2 pumps give 120 washes, 1 pump gives half of that, which is 60 washes.

Now, we know the whole bottle costs $24.00, and it gives you 120 washes. If you use 1 pump per wash, you get 120 washes, and that's the whole bottle.

So, to find out how much 1 pump costs, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps. That means $24.00 divided by 2 pumps equals $12.00 per pump.

Now, we need to change $12.00 to cents. Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, $12.00 is 1200 cents.

So, each pump costs 1200 cents. 

The answer is 1200 cents."
"Joe has $50 to buy his outfit. The shirt he wants is $25, but there's a 30% off sale, so the shirt costs $25 - $7.50 = $17.50. The shorts are $35, and with a 30% off sale, they cost $35 - $10.50 = $24.50. So, the total cost for the outfit is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42. After buying the outfit, Joe will have $50 - $42 = $8 left. So, the answer is $8."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. We know that to make 1 dozen croissants, he needs 1/4 pound of butter. So, for 4 dozen, he needs 4 times 1/4 pound of butter.

Let's do the math:
- 1 dozen = 1/4 pound of butter
- 4 dozen = 4 × 1/4 = 1 pound of butter

So, Juan will need 1 pound of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

The answer is: **1 pound of butter**."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Monica's street is 150 meters long, and it costs $194 to repave each meter. So, to find out how much it costs to repave Monica's street, we multiply 150 by 194. That gives us 29,100 dollars.

Lewis' street is 490 meters long. So, to find out how much it costs to repave Lewis' street, we multiply 490 by 194. That gives us 94,860 dollars.

Now, to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street. So, 94,860 minus 29,100 equals 65,760 dollars.

So, it costs 65,760 dollars more to repave Lewis' street. The answer is 65,760 dollars."

John got $100,000 for the first 5 months. Then, his research took much longer, 10 times as long as the first 5 months, which means it took 50 months in total. But he only got money for the first 5 months, so he got the $100,000 for those 5 months.

Now, the rest of the time, which is 45 months, he got more money each month. Each month after the first 5 months, he got $20,000 plus an extra half, which makes it $30,000 per month. So, for 45 months, he got $30,000 each month. That's 45 times $30,000, which is $1,350,000.

So, if we add the $100,000 for the first 5 months to the $1,350,000 for the rest of the time, we get $1,450,000.

So, the total cost of his research is $1,450,000."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The team had four players. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. The second player had 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces. The third player had a one-pound steak, and since a pound is 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces. The fourth and fifth players didn't eat any meat.

So, we add up what the first three players ate:
6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces.

So, the total ounces of meat the team ate is 30 ounces."
"Okay, let me think about this. We have 1000 members and each posts 3 times a day. March has 31 days. So, if we multiply the number of members by the number of posts each makes a day, we get the total posts per day. That's 1000 times 3, which is 3000 posts a day. Now, to find out how many posts there are in March, we multiply the daily total by the number of days in March. So, 3000 times 31. That gives us 93000 posts. So, the total number of posts in March is 93,000."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Gary does laundry twice a week. That means he does 2 loads of laundry each week. There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 2 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 104 loads of laundry in a year.

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. So, for 104 loads, he uses 104 loads * 20 gallons/load = 2080 gallons of water in a year.

Now, a gallon of water costs $0.15. So, for 2080 gallons, the cost is 2080 gallons * $0.15/gallon = $312.

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year. The answer is $312."
"Okay, let me break it down for you. Scarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale. At the pet store, she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each, so that's 2 times $2.50, which is $5.00. She also bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each, so that's 3 times $2.00, which is $6.00. She got 20 fish at $0.50 each, so that's 20 times $0.50, which is $10.00. Lastly, she bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add all these up: $10.00 (aquarium) + $5.00 (rocks) + $6.00 (coral) + $10.00 (fish) + $2.00 (fish food) = $33.00.

So, Scarlett spent $33.00 in total."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

At first, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall. Then, it grew a lot more in the second week. If it doubled, that means it became 3 times 2, which is 6 inches tall. Then in the third week, it grew even more and added 4 more inches. So, 6 inches plus 4 inches is 10 inches.

So, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall."
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we first figure out how much meat Prince sells in a day. Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day, so he sells:

\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Now, we know the bull weighs 750 kg, and Prince sells 150 kg of meat each day. To find out how many days it will take to sell all the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull's meat by the amount Prince sells in a day:

\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from the bull. The answer is:

\[ \text{5 days} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The auditorium has 4 rows with 18 seats in each row. So, the total number of seats is 4 times 18, which is 72 seats.

Now, one-fourth of these seats were taken by the administrators. So, we take one-fourth of 72, which is 18 seats.

After the administrators took their seats, we have 72 minus 18, which leaves us with 54 seats.

Then, one-third of the remaining seats were taken by the parents. So, we take one-third of 54, which is 18 seats.

Now, the rest of the seats were taken by the students. So, we take the remaining seats after the parents, which is 54 minus 18, leaving us with 36 seats.

So, the number of students in the auditorium is 36."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 4 intersections, and at each intersection, there are 6 poles. Each pole has 4 street lights. So, at one intersection, we have:
\[ 6 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 24 \text{ street lights} \]

Since there are 4 intersections, we multiply the number of street lights at one intersection by 4:
\[ 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights} \]

Now, 20 of these street lights are not working. So, we subtract those from the total:
\[ 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-working lights} = 76 \text{ working lights} \]

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have two DVDs. One has been played 356 times and the other 135 times. Each DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks.

For the first DVD, it can still be played:
1000 - 356 = 644 times.

For the second DVD, it can still be played:
1000 - 135 = 865 times.

So, if we add up how many times both can be played:
644 + 865 = 1509 times.

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks. Each week, he had 2 sessions that each lasted 2 hours. So, he had 24 sessions in total because 6 times 4 is 24. Each hour of therapy cost $125. To find out how much it cost, we multiply the total hours by the cost per hour. So, 24 hours times $125 is $3000. But wait, I made a mistake. I should have done 24 times 125, not 3000. Let me do the math right: 24 times 125 is 3000. So, the total cost is $3000. 

The answer is: **$3000**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. He chews 4 pieces during school because he chews one piece for every 2 hours and he's at school for 8 hours. Then he chews 1 piece on the way home and 1 piece after dinner. So, he has chewed a total of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces. That leaves him with 20 - 6 = 14 pieces. But then he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 pieces. That means he has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces left. So, at the end of the day, Jim has 7 pieces of gum left. The answer is 7."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. If Charmaine will be 16 years old in 12 years, that means she is 4 years old now because 16 minus 12 equals 4. Now, if we want to know how old she will be 4 years from now, we just add those 4 years to her current age. So, 4 plus 4 is 8. Therefore, Charmaine will be 8 years old 4 years from now. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each, so he spent $27. The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each, so he spent $112. To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we subtract the baseball coach's total from the basketball coach's total. So, $112 minus $27 equals $85. Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach. The answer is $85."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Arianna has a garden with 10 rows of flowers, and each row has 20 flowers. So, she has 10 times 20 flowers, which is 200 flowers in total.

Now, we know that 4 out of every 5 flowers have bloomed. To find out how many have bloomed, we can do this:

1. First, we find out what 1 out of 5 flowers is. We do this by dividing 200 by 5, which gives us 40.
2. Since 4 out of every 5 flowers have bloomed, we multiply 40 by 4. That gives us 160.

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed. The answer is 160."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Ashley has a connection that gives her 20 kilobytes of data every second. Now, we know that 1 megabyte is made up of 1000 kilobytes. So, we first find out how many megabytes she gets in one second. 

To do this, we divide 20 kilobytes by 1000 to get megabytes:
\[ 20 \div 1000 = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

Now, we want to know how much data she gets in an hour. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the megabytes per second by 3600:
\[ 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

So, Ashley's internet speed in megabytes per hour is 72 Mb/h. The answer is 72."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine the tow truck was very busy. For the first three days, it helped pull 10 cars each day. So, for three days, that's 10 cars/day times 3 days, which equals 30 cars.

Then, for the next four days, the tow truck helped pull fewer cars. It pulled 4 cars less each day than the first three days, so it pulled 6 cars each day. For four days, that's 6 cars/day times 4 days, which equals 24 cars.

Now, to find out how many cars the tow truck helped pull in total, we add the cars from the first three days to the cars from the next four days. So, 30 cars plus 24 cars equals 54 cars.

So, the tow truck helped pull a total of 54 cars that week. The answer is 54."
"Adam needs to grow 2/3 of a foot to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster. He grows 2 inches, which is 1/6 of a foot, every year. To grow 2/3 of a foot, he needs to grow 2/3 ÷ 1/6 = 4 years. So, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The answer is 4 years."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without all the big words.

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000. So, the total cost of all the cars is $250,000. The company paid $75,000 to get these cars because they paid 30% of the price. So, James made $175,000 in profit. He gets 10% of this profit as a commission. So, he gets $17,500.

So, the amount James made is $17,500."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Tiffany saw a big wave that was more than 30 feet tall. Only 25% of the 100 riders could stay on the wave without falling. So, 25 out of 100 riders can stay on the wave. That means 25 / 100 * 100 = 25 riders can stay on the wave.

Out of these 25 riders, 60% are women. So, 60 out of 100 of the 25 riders are women. That means 60 / 100 * 25 = 15 riders are women.

The rest of the riders are men. So, if 15 are women, then 25 - 15 = 10 riders are men.

So, 10 men can stay on the wave. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easy to understand.

We have a diamond jewel that costs $2000. Now, a gold jewel costs 4/5 of that, so we calculate it like this:

\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \]

So, the gold jewel costs $1600.

Next, we know a silver jewel costs $400 less than the gold jewel, so:

\[ 1600 - 400 = 1200 \]

So, the silver jewel costs $1200.

Now, to find the total cost of all three jewels, we add up the costs:

\[ 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800.

The answer is $4800."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He got 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so that's 16 plus 3, which is 19 truck stamps. Then he got 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so that's 19 minus 9, which is 10 rose stamps.

Now, to find out how many stamps he got in total, I'll add them all up: 16 snowflake stamps plus 19 truck stamps plus 10 rose stamps. That makes 16 + 19 + 10, which is 45.

So, Max got 45 stamps in all."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. That means Tom is catching up to Bob at a rate of 15 miles every hour because 70 minus 55 is 15.

Now, Bob is 75 miles ahead. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up, we divide the distance by how fast Tom is closing the gap. So, 75 miles divided by 15 miles per hour equals 5 hours.

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Naomi caught 17 fish. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so that's 17 - 6 = 11 fish. Tommy caught 3 more than Darren, so that's 11 + 3 = 14 fish.

So, Tommy caught 14 fish."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Manny signed up for 10 karate classes that cost a total of $60. His parents said if each class costs more than $10, they won't sign him up again. We need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class goes over $10.

If the cost per class is more than $10, his parents won't sign him up. So, we need to find out how many classes he can miss so that each class costs $10 or less.

If he misses 6 classes, he still has 4 classes left. The total cost is $60, and if he misses 6 classes, the cost for the 4 classes he takes is $60. So, the cost per class would be:
\[ \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]
This is more than $10, so his parents won't sign him up again.

If he misses 5 classes, he still has 5 classes left. The total cost is $60, and if he misses 5 classes, the cost for the 5 classes he takes is $60. So, the cost per class would be:
\[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]
This is more than $10, so his parents won't sign him up again.

If he misses 4 classes, he still has 6 classes left. The total cost is $60, and if he misses 4 classes, the cost for the 6 classes he takes is $60. So, the cost per class would be:
\[ \frac{60}{6} = 10 \]
This is exactly $10, so his parents might still sign him up.

If he misses 3 classes, he still has 7 classes left. The total cost is $60, and if he misses 3 classes, the cost for the 7 classes he takes is $60. So, the cost per class would be:
\[ \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57 \]
This is less than $10, so his parents might still sign him up.

If he misses 2 classes, he still has 8 classes left. The total cost is $60, and if he misses 2 classes, the cost for the 8 classes he takes is $60. So, the cost per class would be:
\[ \frac{60}{8} = 7.5 \]
This is less than $10, so his parents might still sign him up.

If he misses 1 class, he still has 9 classes left. The total cost is $60, and if he misses 1 class, the cost for the 9 classes he takes is $60. So, the cost per class would be:
\[ \frac{60}{9} \approx 6.67 \]
This is less than $10, so his parents might still sign him up.

If he misses 0 classes, he takes all 10 classes. The total cost is $60, and if he takes all 10 classes, the cost per class would be:
\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]
This is less than $10, so his parents might still sign him up.

So, the maximum number of classes he can miss before his parents won't sign him up again is 4. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, we have two people, Julie and Jewel. Jewel can process 50 customers a day. Julie can process twice as many, so she can process 100 customers a day.

Now, if they work all week, which is 7 days, we need to find out how many customers each of them can process in a week.

For Jewel:
- 50 customers/day × 7 days = 350 customers in a week.

For Julie:
- 100 customers/day × 7 days = 700 customers in a week.

Now, to find out the total for both of them in a week, we add the numbers together:
- 350 customers (Jewel) + 700 customers (Julie) = 1050 customers in a week.

So, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers. The answer is 1050."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so that's 5 times 4, which is 20 miles. Reggie also ran 3 miles more than Lynn. So, if we take 20 miles and subtract 3 miles, we get how many miles Lynn ran. That means Lynn ran 17 miles. So, the answer is 17 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have some apples and oranges, and we know how much they cost. Four apples cost $5.20, so one apple costs $5.20 divided by 4, which is $1.30. Three oranges cost $3.30, so one orange costs $3.30 divided by 3, which is $1.10.

Now, we want to know how much 5 apples and 5 oranges cost. If one apple costs $1.30, then 5 apples cost $1.30 times 5, which is $6.50. If one orange costs $1.10, then 5 oranges cost $1.10 times 5, which is $5.50.

So, the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges is $6.50 plus $5.50, which is $12.00.

So, Clyde will pay $12.00."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Bob wants to dig a hole that's 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep. To find out how big the hole is, we multiply these numbers together: 6 times 4 times 3. That gives us 72. So, the hole is 72 cubic feet big.

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to dig one cubic foot of earth. So, to dig 72 cubic feet, we multiply 72 by 3. That gives us 216 seconds.

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole. That's a long time, isn't it?"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Bill wants a truck that costs $30,000. He's adding some extra stuff to it. First, he gets a king cab for $7,500. Then, he gets leather seats, which cost one-third of the king cab, so that's $2,500. Next, he gets running boards, which cost $500 less than the leather seats, so that's $2,000. Finally, he gets the upgraded lights for $1,500.

Now, we add all these costs together:
- Base price: $30,000
- King cab: $7,500
- Leather seats: $2,500
- Running boards: $2,000
- Upgraded lights: $1,500

So, we add them all up:
$30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Tim used to make $20,000 a month. Now, he gets a raise that's 5% more, so that's $20,000 times 0.05, which is $1,000. So now he makes $20,000 plus $1,000, which is $21,000 a month.

He also gets a bonus that's half of what he used to make, so that's $20,000 divided by 2, which is $10,000. So now he gets $10,000 extra each month.

So, his new total monthly pay is $21,000 plus $10,000, which is $31,000 a month.

Now, to find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his new monthly pay by 12 months. So, $31,000 times 12 is $372,000.

So, Tim will make $372,000 in a year."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750. So, the suits cost him 10 times $750, which is $7500.

He also buys 10 pairs of dress pants, and each pair costs half of a suit, which is $750 divided by 5, so each pair costs $150. So, 10 pairs cost $150 times 10, which is $1500.

Lastly, he buys 3 dress shirts for each suit, so for 10 suits, he buys 30 shirts. Each shirt costs $60, so 30 shirts cost $60 times 30, which is $1800.

Now, to find out the total cost, we add up all these costs: $7500 (suits) + $1500 (pants) + $1800 (shirts) = $10800.

So, the total cost is $10800."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have two news websites. One website makes 20 news articles every day, and the other makes 10 news articles every day. February has 28 days.

First, we find out how many articles the first website makes in February:
- 20 articles/day × 28 days = 560 articles

Then, we find out how many articles the second website makes in February:
- 10 articles/day × 28 days = 280 articles

Now, we add the articles from both websites:
- 560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles

So, the total number of articles the two websites make together in February is 840."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Steve is 60 years old. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is 64 years old. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is 32 years old. The son's wife is 3 years younger than the son, so she is 29 years old. So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a bag of flour that's split into 8 parts, and each part weighs 2 kilograms. So, if we put all these parts back together, how much flour do we have? That's right, 8 parts times 2 kilograms each part gives us 16 kilograms of flour in one bag.

Now, if we have three bags, we just multiply the 16 kilograms by 3. So, 16 times 3 is 48. That means we have 48 kilograms of flour in total from three bags.

So, the answer is 48 kilograms."
"Alisa biked at 12 miles an hour for 4.5 hours, so she biked 12 times 4.5, which is 54 miles. Stanley biked at 10 miles an hour for 2.5 hours, so he biked 10 times 2.5, which is 25 miles. Together, they biked 54 plus 25 miles, which is 79 miles. So, the total distance they biked is 79 miles. The answer is 79 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Bill is digging a well. He can dig 4 feet in an hour through the soil. He can dig half that fast, which is 2 feet per hour, through the clay.

He needs to dig 24 feet of soil. If he digs 4 feet an hour, it will take him 24 feet ÷ 4 feet/hour = 6 hours to dig through the soil.

Then he needs to dig 8 feet of clay. If he digs 2 feet an hour through the clay, it will take him 8 feet ÷ 2 feet/hour = 4 hours to dig through the clay.

So, the total time he spends digging is 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, the answer is 10 hours."
"Howie wants to buy cupcakes for everyone in his class, including himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. He's thinking of getting one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person. So, he needs to buy cupcakes for 27 people in total. Each person gets 2 cupcakes, so he needs to buy:

\[ 27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes per person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes} \]

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes. The answer is 54."
"Oh, hello there! Let me explain this to you in a simpler way, okay?

Fishio posted a picture on Instagram, and people liked it. After one week, 2000 people liked it. Then, three weeks later, a lot more people liked it. It was 70 times as many likes as the first week. So, if we multiply 2000 by 70, we get 140,000 likes after three weeks.

Then, a few more people liked it, and they gave 20,000 more likes. So, we add 20,000 to 140,000, and we get 160,000 likes in total.

So, the total number of likes on Fishio's picture is 160,000. That's the answer, isn't it?"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. That's 20 times 20, which is 400 dollars. But she got a $2 discount, so she paid 400 minus 2, which is 398 dollars.

The next day, the pomegranates cost $30 each, but there was a 10% discount on the total. So, first, we find out how much 20 pomegranates cost without the discount: 20 times 30 is 600 dollars. Then, we take 10% off that, which is 60 dollars. So, we subtract 60 from 600, and that gives us 540 dollars.

Now, we find the difference between what Clara paid and what Sheila paid: 540 minus 398 is 142 dollars.

So, the difference is 142 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Ariadne sold red hats for $400. That's half the amount she got from selling green hats. So, if $400 is half, then she got $800 from green hats.

In the first month, she got $400 from red hats and $800 from green hats, so she made $1200 in total.

In the second month, she made 3/4 of what she made in the first month. So, she made 3/4 of $1200, which is $900.

Now, to find out how much she made in two months, we add the money she made in the first month and the second month together. So, $1200 + $900 = $2100.

So, the total amount she made in two months is $2100."

James hires a carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours. But he gets 1 hour for free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The first hour he pays $15. The second hour, which is twice as much as the first, he pays $30. The third hour, which is twice as much as the second, he pays $60.

So, if we add up what he pays for each of the 3 hours, it's $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

So, James pays $105 for the carriage."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sally started with $200 in her bank account. By the end of the week, she had $420. That means she earned $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Now, her weekly wage should be $300. So, to find out how much was taken away, we subtract her weekly wage from what she earned: $220 - $300 = -$80.

Since we can't have a negative amount taken away, it means $80 was taken away from her wage. So, the answer is $80.

The correct answer is: **$80**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Lori needs 48 deviled egg halves for her 16 guests, and each whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves. So, she needs 24 whole eggs. Since a dozen is 12 eggs, she needs 24 divided by 12, which is 2 dozen eggs. So, the answer is 2 dozen eggs."
"Shiela needs to write a 15-page research paper. She's done with 1/3 of it, which is 5 pages. So, she has 15 minus 5 pages left to write. That means she has 10 pages left. So, the answer is 10 pages."
"Mike's teacher gave him a book to read that has 200 pages. He plans to read 10 pages every day. To finish the book, he needs to read 200 pages ÷ 10 pages per day = 20 days. If the assignment is due in 30 days, then he will finish in 20 days. So, he will finish 30 - 20 = 10 days before the deadline. The answer is 10 days."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James bought a plane that cost $150,000. He has to pay $5,000 a month to rent a place to keep the plane. He also spends twice that on fuel every month, so that's $10,000 a month for fuel.

So, every month he spends $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000. For a whole year, which is 12 months, he spends $15,000 x 12 = $180,000.

But he also had to pay for the plane when he bought it, which was $150,000. So, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000. 

The answer is: **$330,000**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Finley bought rice, beans, and pork to cook at home. She took 30 minutes to cook the rice. It took her 20 more minutes to cook the pork than the rice, so that's 30 + 20 = 50 minutes for pork. Beans took half the time of rice and pork together. So, we add the time for rice and pork: 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Half of 80 minutes is 40 minutes, so beans took 40 minutes to cook.

Now, to find out how long it took to cook all the food, we add the time for rice, beans, and pork: 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 minutes.

So, it took her 120 minutes to cook all the food. The answer is 120 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without all the big words.

We have two mixtures:
1. One that's 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.
2. Another that's 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts.

Almonds cost $10 per pound, and walnuts cost $15 per pound.

For the first mixture:
- 1/2 pound of almonds cost \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- 1/3 pound of walnuts cost \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

For the second mixture:
- 1/5 pound of almonds cost \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- 1/3 pound of walnuts cost \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more the first mixture costs:
- The first mixture costs 10 dollars.
- The second mixture costs 7 dollars.
- So, the first mixture costs \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars more.

The answer is 3 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way.

Lee has sheep and geese on his farm. We know that sheep have 4 legs and 1 head, and geese have 2 legs and 1 head. Lee told us that there are 20 heads and 70 legs in total.

If we count the heads, we see there are 20 heads. Since each animal has 1 head, that means there are 20 animals in total.

Now, if we think about the legs, we know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. If we add up all the legs, we get 70.

To figure out how many sheep there are, we can use a simple trick. Let's say there are \( S \) sheep. Then there are \( 20 - S \) geese because the total number of animals is 20.

Sheep have 4 legs each, so \( S \) sheep have \( 4S \) legs. Geese have 2 legs each, so \( 20 - S \) geese have \( 2(20 - S) \) legs.

The total number of legs is 70, so we can write the equation:
\[ 4S + 2(20 - S) = 70 \]

Simplifying this:
\[ 4S + 40 - 2S = 70 \]
\[ 2S + 40 = 70 \]
\[ 2S = 30 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, Lee has 15 sheep on his farm."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Roger usually buys coffee for $5 a pound. But since he couldn't find his favorite brand, he had to buy a more expensive one that costs 20% more. So, the new coffee costs $5 plus 20% of $5, which is $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

He needs coffee for a week, and he uses 1 pound a day, so he needs 7 pounds of coffee. At $6 per pound, the coffee costs him 7 pounds times $6 per pound, which is $42.

He also buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost is $42 for the coffee plus $2 for the donut, which is $44.

So, the total cost is $44."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Gus went to the store and spent $20.00. He bought some chips, a chicken, and a soda. The chips cost $2.00 each and he got 2 bags, so that's $4.00. The chicken was $8.00 and the soda was $1.00. So, if we add all these up, it's $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Gus had $20.00 to spend, and he spent $13.00 on the chips, chicken, and soda. So, the rest must be the apple pie. If we take $20.00 and subtract $13.00, we get $7.00.

So, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. James delivers 600 newspapers in a day. He gives 198 to District A and 209 to District C. To find out how many he gives to District B, we need to subtract the numbers for District A and C from the total.

So, we do 600 minus 198 for District A and then we do 402 minus 209 for District C. That gives us 193 newspapers for District B.

So, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B. The answer is 193."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John goes to a cooking class that meets 4 times a week. Each time, he goes for 2 hours. He goes to these classes for 6 weeks. So, we need to find out how many hours he spends in class in total.

First, we calculate the total hours he spends in class:
- He goes 4 times a week.
- Each time, it's 2 hours.
- He does this for 6 weeks.

So, we multiply the number of times he goes in a week by the number of hours each time and then by the number of weeks:
\[ 4 \times 2 \times 6 = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Now, John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by the hours it takes to learn one recipe:
\[ \frac{48}{1.5} = 32 \]

So, John learns 32 recipes. The answer is 32."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

There are 150 teachers on the basketball court. 60% of them are history teachers, which means 90 teachers are history teachers because 60% of 150 is 90. So, the rest of the teachers are math teachers. That means 150 minus 90 equals 60 math teachers.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. So, if there are 60 math teachers, the total time they spend sleeping in one day is 60 times 6 hours. 

60 times 6 equals 360 hours.

So, the math teachers spend 360 hours sleeping in one day. The answer is 360 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has 3/4 of what Aurelia has, so Kassidy has $90. Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so Rayna has $150.

Now, if we add up all their money, it's $120 + $90 + $150 = $360. If they share this money equally, each person gets $360 ÷ 3 = $120.

So, each person would get $120. The answer is:

\boxed{120}"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The game has 4 quarters, and each quarter is 12 minutes long. So, for the first three quarters, that's 3 times 12 minutes, which is 36 minutes. The last quarter was a bit longer because it had a tie and they had to play for 5 more minutes. So, the last quarter was 12 plus 5, which is 17 minutes.

Now, if we add the time for the first three quarters (36 minutes) to the time for the last quarter (17 minutes), we get 53 minutes.

So, the game lasted 53 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a company with 50 people. Out of these, 20% are managers. So, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 managers in the company. Now, out of these 10 managers, only 30% of them oversee the whole company. So, we calculate 30% of 10:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 managers oversee the company. The answer is 3."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

For every muffin, Svetlana needs 5 tablespoons of flour, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 0.25 of a tablespoon of salt. That's a total of 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 tablespoons of dry ingredients for one muffin.

Now, if she wants to make 16 muffins, we need to multiply the amount of dry ingredients for one muffin by 16. So, 8.25 tablespoons times 16 is 132 tablespoons.

So, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins. The answer is 132."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, we have three friends: Robert, Cindy, and Aaron. They had some candy they got on Halloween. Robert had 3 pounds, Cindy had 5 pounds, and Aaron had 4 pounds. If they put all their candy together and share it equally, how much candy does each person get?

First, we need to find out how much candy they have in total. We add up what each person has:
3 pounds (Robert) + 5 pounds (Cindy) + 4 pounds (Aaron) = 12 pounds of candy in total.

Now, they want to share this 12 pounds of candy equally among the three of them. So, we divide the total candy by 3:
12 pounds ÷ 3 = 4 pounds of candy per person.

So, each person gets 4 pounds of candy. The answer is 4 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Adam bought 7 candies of type A, and each costs $0.5. So, 7 times $0.5 is $3.5. Then he bought 10 candies of type B, and each costs $0.75. So, 10 times $0.75 is $7.5. Now, if we add $3.5 and $7.5, we get $11.

Adam gave the cashier $15 to buy these candies. So, to find out how much change he got, we take $15 and subtract the $11 he spent. That means $15 minus $11 is $4.

So, Adam got $4 in change. The answer is $4."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Christina recorded her moods for 30 days. She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral days. We know the first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the last 8 days were neutral. Then, the last three days were good, neutral, and good.

To find out how many good days are left, we count:
- First 8 days: 8 good
- Second 8 days: 0 good
- Third 8 days: 0 good
- Last 3 days: 1 good + 1 good = 2 good

So, out of the 12 good days, 10 are already counted. That leaves 2 good days.

The number of good days left in the month is 2.

So, the answer is: 2"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. If Janey has 21 books and that's 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has, we can figure out how many books Sally has.

First, we know that Janey's books can be written as 21 = 2 times Sally's books plus 3. So, if we take away the 3, we get 21 - 3 = 18. Now, 18 is twice the number of books Sally has. So, if we divide 18 by 2, we get 9.

So, Sally has 9 books."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Mrs. Jameson's bamboo grows 30 inches every day. It's currently 20 feet tall, which is 240 inches. We want to know how many days it will take for the bamboo to be 600 inches tall.

First, we need to find out how much taller the bamboo needs to grow. The bamboo is 240 inches tall now and we want it to be 600 inches tall, so:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches every day, so to find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide:

\[ 360 \text{ inches} \div 30 \text{ inches/day} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to be 600 inches tall. The answer is 12 days."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. That means he has 1 toy for each dog. Now, there are 8 more dogs, so he needs 8 more toys to have 1 toy for each dog. So, he needs 8 toys.

After buying those 8 toys, he sees there are now 12 dogs in total (4 original dogs + 8 new dogs). So, he needs 12 toys now.

Then, when he comes back, 3 dogs have gone away. So, he only needs toys for 9 dogs (12 total - 3 gone).

So, in total, he needs 8 toys (first time) + 12 toys (after buying) + 9 toys (when he came back) = 29 toys.

The total number of toys James needs is 29."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We start with $1200 in the account. Dylan puts in 2/5 of that, which is $480. So now we have $1200 - $480 = $720 left.

Frances then puts in 2/3 of the remaining $720, which is $480. So now we have $720 - $480 = $240 left.

The rest, which is $240, goes to Skyler. So Skyler's investment is $240.

The answer is: **$240**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Carol and Jennifer already have some signatures. Carol has 20, and Jennifer has 44. So together, they have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures.

They want to have 100 signatures in total. So, they need 100 - 64 = 36 more signatures to reach their goal.

So, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Lorie makes $10 an hour. Karen makes twice as much, so she makes $20 an hour. If Karen works 3 hours a day, she makes $20 times 3, which is $60 a day. In two days, she makes $60 times 2, which is $120. So, the answer is $120."
"Okay, let's think about this. If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, that means each potato makes 6 hash browns (36 divided by 6). Now, if I have 96 potatoes, I can figure out how many hash browns I can make by multiplying 96 by 6. So, 96 times 6 is 576. Therefore, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes. The answer is 576."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The elevator can hold 700 kg. Jack is 80 kg and there are 8 other adults, each also 80 kg. So, the 8 adults together weigh 8 times 80 kg, which is 640 kg. Adding Jack's weight, the total weight is 80 kg + 640 kg = 720 kg.

The elevator can only hold 700 kg, so we need to find out how much more than 700 kg they are. That's 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

So, they will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg. The answer is 20 kg."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, we have Katarina with 68 cookies. She has 5 less than Max, so Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Max has 12 more than the Cookie Monster, so the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Summer has 23 more than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, to find out how many cookies they all have together, we add them up: 68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298 cookies.

So, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Shania made her dress longer by adding half of its original length and then added 20 more centimeters. The dress ended up being 140 centimeters long. To find out how long the dress was originally, we can think of it like this:

1. Let's say the original dress was 80 centimeters long.
2. She added half of 80 centimeters, which is 40 centimeters, to make it longer.
3. Then she added 20 more centimeters for the lace.
4. So, 80 (original) + 40 (half of original) + 20 (lace) = 140 centimeters.

If we check, 80 + 40 + 20 does indeed equal 140. So, the original dress was 80 centimeters long."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Chris has a mower that can mow his lawn in two different ways. In one way, it takes him 1 hour, which is 60 minutes. In the other way, it takes him 40 minutes.

Today, he decided to mow half of the lawn at 60 minutes speed and the other half at 40 minutes speed. So, he mowed half the lawn in 60 minutes and the other half in 40 minutes.

To find out how long it took him in total, we add the time for each half:
- Half the lawn in 60 minutes.
- The other half in 40 minutes.

So, 60 minutes + 40 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, it took Chris 100 minutes to mow the whole lawn.

The answer is: 100 minutes."
"They have 30 minutes in total to get to school. By the time they reach the fire station, it takes them 19 minutes. So, they have 11 minutes left to get to school. The answer is 11 minutes."
"Okay, let me break it down simply. Catherine buys apples for $4, bananas for $2 per kilo and she buys 2 kilos, so that's $2 times 2, which is $4. For the oranges, she buys 2 kilos and they cost $3 per kilo, so that's $3 times 2, which is $6. Now, if we add all these up: $4 for apples, $4 for bananas, and $6 for oranges, we get $4 + $4 + $6 = $14. So, Catherine pays $14 in total."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Greta makes 30 cookies, and Celinda makes twice as many, so Celinda makes 60 cookies. Together, they make 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.

But then they eat 10 cookies while they're cooling, so they have 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left.

So, the number of cookies in the box is 80."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have one twin and one triplet. The twin is 7 years older than the triplet. If we add up all their ages, it comes to 44 years.

Let's say the triplet is 6 years old. Then the twin would be 6 plus 7, which is 13 years old.

If we put 6 for the triplet and 13 for the twin, we can check if their ages add up to 44:
\[ 6 + 6 + 13 + 13 = 44 \]

So, the twin is 13 years old. That's the answer."
"John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner, which is 180 minutes. He needs to do his homework which takes 20 minutes for math, 40 minutes for reading, and 20 minutes for history. So, that's 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. If he subtracts the time he needs for his homework from the time he has before dinner, he gets 180 - 80 = 100 minutes. So, John has 100 minutes to take a nap. The answer is 100 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so five lollipops cost:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]
That means the four candies cost:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]
So, one candy costs:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]
Now, we want to know how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost. Ten lollipops cost:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
And ten candies cost:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]
So, the total cost is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]
Therefore, 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost Manolo $7.00."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves a bit more, 28 coins every month, because he saves 2/5 times more than Rong.

Now, if we want to know how many coins they have after 10 years, we first figure out how many months are in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are 120 months.

Rong saves 20 coins each month, so in 120 months, he saves:
\[ 20 \times 120 = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

Neil saves 28 coins each month, so in 120 months, he saves:
\[ 28 \times 120 = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

Now, to find out how many coins they have together, we add Rong's and Neil's savings:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

So, after 10 years, they have 5760 coins in total. The answer is 5760."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the vaccines cost $20 times 2, which is $40. There's also a heartworm check that costs 60% of the total bill. If we add the cost of the vaccines to the heartworm check, we get the total bill.

First, let's find out how much the heartworm check costs. If the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill, and the vaccines cost $40, then the total bill is $100 because $40 is 40% and the heartworm check makes it 60% of $100.

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125, and after paying $100, he will have $125 minus $100, which is $25 left.

So, the amount John leaves with is $25."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. We have a crate of fruit that has 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges. We know the price of apples and bananas, and we need to find out how much oranges cost.

First, we find out how much one banana costs. Since one apple costs $0.5 and a banana costs twice as much, one banana costs $1.0.

Next, we calculate the cost of the bananas. Since there are 5 bananas and each costs $1.0, the total cost for bananas is $5.0.

Then, we calculate the cost of the apples. There are 12 apples and each costs $0.5, so the total cost for apples is $6.0.

Now, we need to find out how much one orange costs. Oranges are the most expensive and cost three times as much as a banana. Since a banana costs $1.0, an orange costs $3.0.

Finally, we calculate the cost of the oranges. There are 7 oranges and each costs $3.0, so the total cost for oranges is $21.0.

To find the total cost of the crate, we add up the costs of the bananas, apples, and oranges:
$5.0 (bananas) + $6.0 (apples) + $21.0 (oranges) = $32.0

So, the price for the crate of fruit is $32.0."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Brittany's comforter has different colored squares. We know the numbers:

- 14 red squares
- 4 more blue squares than red, so that's 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares
- 6 more green squares than blue, so that's 18 + 6 = 24 green squares
- 12 fewer white squares than green, so that's 24 - 12 = 12 white squares

Now, to find out how many square feet the comforter is, we add up all the squares:

14 red + 18 blue + 24 green + 12 white = 68 squares

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, each square is 1 square foot. So, the total area is 68 square feet.

So, the comforter is 68 square feet."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, there's a party coming up with 42 grown-ups and 15 babies. That makes 57 people total. The restaurant has some chairs, and we know it has 8 high chairs. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, so it has 40 regular chairs.

Now, if we add up all the chairs, we get 40 regular + 8 high = 48 chairs.

But we need 57 chairs for all the people. So, we need 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs.

So, the answer is 9 more chairs."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 50 deer in a field. If 50 percent of them are bucks, that means we have 25 bucks. Now, if 20 percent of these bucks are 8 points, we need to find out how many that is. So, 20 percent of 25 is 5. Therefore, there are 5 bucks that have 8 points. The answer is 5."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a class of four students: Adam, Martha, Betty, and Tom. Adam has 50 points. Betty got more points than Adam, 30% more. So, Betty got 50 + (30% of 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points. Tom has 30 points, and Betty got 30 more points than Tom, so Betty got 30 + 30 = 60 points, but we already know Betty got 65 points. Martha got 3 times as many points as Tom, so Martha got 3 * 30 = 90 points.

Now, we add up all the points:
Adam: 50
Betty: 65
Martha: 90
Tom: 30

Total points = 50 + 65 + 90 + 30 = 235 points.

The class needs 400 points to go on the trip. So, the points they are missing are:
400 - 235 = 165 points.

So, the class is missing 165 points. The answer is 165."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Great Grandma Jones has three kids. Each of those kids has three grandkids. So, that makes 3 kids times 3 grandkids each, which is 9 grandkids. Now, each of those grandkids has three great grandkids. So, we take the 9 grandkids and multiply them by 3 great grandkids each, which gives us 27 great grandkids. So, if all of them come to the family reunion, there will be 27 great grandkids for Great Grandma Jones to kiss."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Greta gets a paycheck of $2400. She puts half of that into her retirement account. So, she puts $2400 * 0.50 = $1200 into her retirement. 

After putting money into her retirement, she has $2400 - $1200 = $1200 left.

Then, she uses 20% of her original paycheck for her car payment. So, she uses $2400 * 0.20 = $480 for her car.

Now, after paying for her car, she has $1200 - $480 = $720 left to spend.

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720."
"Okay, let's think about this. We know the box can hold 20 pencils, but 4 are missing. So, we have 16 pencils left in the box. Now, if we want to know how many pairs of pencils we have, we can divide the number of pencils by 2 because each pair has 2 pencils. 

So, 16 divided by 2 is 8. That means we have 8 pairs of pencils in the box. 

The answer is 8 pairs."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The city is going to set off 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 20 fireworks. So, if we multiply 15 by 20, we get 300 fireworks in total.

Now, Hannah can see 40% of these fireworks from her house. To find out how many she can see, we take 40% of 300, which is 0.40 times 300. That gives us 120 fireworks.

Hannah also sets off 3 boxes of fireworks in her backyard, and each box has 5 fireworks. So, 3 boxes times 5 fireworks each equals 15 fireworks.

Now, to find out the total number of fireworks Hannah sees, we add the 120 fireworks she sees from the display to the 15 fireworks she sets off in her backyard. That makes 120 plus 15, which is 135 fireworks in total.

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah sees is 135."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Aiden and his friends are going to see a movie. Aiden has 12 friends coming with him, and then they meet 7 more friends at the cinema. So, that makes a total of 20 people.

Each person needs a seat, two drinks, and three snacks. So, for 20 people, they need:
- 20 seats
- 20 people × 2 drinks = 40 drinks
- 20 people × 3 snacks = 60 snacks

Each drink and each snack costs $2. So, the total cost for drinks is:
- 40 drinks × $2 = $80

And the total cost for snacks is:
- 60 snacks × $2 = $120

Adding the cost of drinks and snacks together:
- $80 + $120 = $200

So, the group spent a total of $200 on drinks and snacks. The answer is $200."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have three truck drivers: Gissela, Gordy, and Gary. Gissela's truck can carry 4,000 pounds. Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so that's 4,800 pounds. When all three trucks are together, they can carry 11,600 pounds in total.

Now, to find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

So, we do 11,600 (total capacity) minus 4,000 (Gissela's capacity) minus 4,800 (Gordy's capacity). That gives us 2,800 pounds.

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 6 girls and each one ate 3 dumplings. So, 6 times 3 is 18 dumplings for the girls.

Now, we have 8 boys and each one ate 1 more dumpling than the girls. Since the girls ate 3, the boys ate 4 dumplings each. So, 8 times 4 is 32 dumplings for the boys.

Now, if we add the dumplings the girls ate and the dumplings the boys ate, we get 18 plus 32, which is 50.

So, Larry cooked 50 dumplings. The answer is 50."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Gerald and Julia split $100 in the ratio 3:2. That means for every 5 parts, Gerald gets 3 parts and Julia gets 2 parts.

First, we find out how much one part is. We do this by dividing $100 by 5, which gives us $20. So, one part is $20.

Now, to find out how much Gerald got, we multiply $20 by 3 (because he got 3 parts), which gives us $60.

Gerald then spent $10 on a book. So, we subtract $10 from $60 to find out how much he has left. That gives us $50.

So, Gerald has $50 left. The answer is $50."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Martha's cat can run 15 feet in one second. The turtle is 5 times slower, so the turtle can only run 3 feet in one second.

Now, if we want to know how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time. So, 3 feet/second times 40 seconds equals 120 feet.

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The answer is 120 feet."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The firefighters want to raise $6300. They've already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. That means they need to raise $4200 more to reach their goal.

If they raise $700 every hour, we can figure out how many more hours they need to raise the rest. To find out, we divide the remaining amount by the amount they raise each hour:

\[ \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to raise money for 6 more hours. Adding the first 3 hours they've already worked, the total hours they need to work is:

\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]

So, the total number of hours they need to work to reach their goal is 9 hours. The answer is:

9"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We know Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. Out of that 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes. So, to find out how much is used for other things, we need to subtract the industrial part from the total used by Colorado City.

First, we find out how much water is used for industrial purposes:
- 80% of 40% is 32%.

Now, to find out how much is used for other things, we subtract the industrial part from the total used by Colorado City:
- 40% - 32% = 8%.

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes. The answer is 8%.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We know there are 7 days in a week. If Alex charges $12 for each day, then for one week, she would charge:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 12 \text{ dollars/day} = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, for 2 weeks, we just double that amount:
\[ 84 \text{ dollars} \times 2 = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Alex would charge $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

First, we know the factory makes chocolate ice cream. In 2 hours, they make 100 quarts. So, in 48 hours, which is 24 times 2 hours, they would make 24 times 100 quarts. That's 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.

Next, for vanilla ice cream, in 4 hours, they make 50 quarts. So, in 48 hours, which is 12 times 4 hours, they would make 12 times 50 quarts. That's 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.

Now, to find out how many quarts of ice cream they make in total, we add the chocolate and vanilla ice cream together. So, 2400 quarts of chocolate plus 600 quarts of vanilla equals 3000 quarts of ice cream in total.

So, the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

First, I'll count up all the croissants, cinnamon rolls, mini quiches, and blueberry muffins.

- Croissants: 5 at $3.00 each, so that's 5 * 3 = $15.00.
- Cinnamon rolls: 4 at $2.50 each, so that's 4 * 2.50 = $10.00.
- Mini quiches: 3 at $4.00 each, so that's 3 * 4 = $12.00.
- Blueberry muffins: 13 at $1.00 each, so that's 13 * 1 = $13.00.

Now, I'll add all these up: $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00.

At the checkout, Marcus gets a 10% discount. So, 10% of $50.00 is $5.00 (because 10% is the same as 10 out of 100, which is 1/10, and 1/10 of 50 is 5).

So, if we take $5.00 off the $50.00, we get $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"Oh, okay. So, they're giving you a scoop for free when you buy two. Each scoop costs $1.50. If you have $6.00, you can figure out how many scoops you can get.

First, you can buy 2 scoops for $3.00 because 2 times $1.50 is $3.00. With $6.00, you can do this twice because 6 divided by 3 is 2. So, you can get 2 times 2 scoops, which is 4 scoops. But remember, for every 2 scoops you buy, you get 1 for free. So, from 4 scoops, you get 2 free ones. That makes a total of 6 scoops.

So, the answer is 6 scoops."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces every day, and Amy eats 3 pieces every day. We want to know how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, we find out how many days are in two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days} \]

Now, let's see how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after 14 days, Ginger has:
\[ 100 - 56 = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, let's see how much candy Amy eats in 14 days. Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

So, after 14 days, Amy has:
\[ 100 - 42 = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, to find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the number of pieces Ginger has from the number of pieces Amy has:
\[ 58 - 44 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mr. Boarden's bathroom is 36 square feet big. He needs 24 tiles for every square foot. So, for the whole bathroom, he needs:
\[ 36 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 864 \text{ tiles} \]

Now, he only needs to cover two-thirds of his bathroom. So, we find out how much two-thirds of 36 is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Since he needs 24 tiles for every square foot, for 24 square feet, he needs:
\[ 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} \times 24 \text{ sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden needs 576 tiles to cover two-thirds of his bathroom. The answer is 576."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James went to pick blueberries and it cost him $20 to go there. He also had to pay $1.5 for every pound he picked. He picked 30 pounds, so he paid $1.5 times 30, which is $45 for the blueberries. Adding the $20 to go, he spent a total of $65.

Now, if he had bought the same 30 pounds at the store, it would cost him $2.5 for each pound. So, 30 pounds times $2.5 is $75. 

To find out how much he saved, we take the money he spent at the store and subtract the money he spent picking them himself. So, $75 minus $65 is $10.

So, James saved $10 by picking the blueberries himself. The answer is $10."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The company wanted to buy 500 computers, and they thought each one would cost $700. But then they found out each computer costs 10% more than that. So, the new price is $770 for each computer.

Now, to find out how much they paid in total, we multiply the new price by the number of computers:

\[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

So, the total amount they paid is $385,000. 

The answer is: **$385,000**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John makes an omelet with 6 eggs, 2 ounces of cheese, and 2 ounces of ham. Eggs are like big yucky things that give you energy, and they have 75 calories each. Cheese is like a yummy white stuff that has 120 calories for every ounce. Ham is like a salty meat that has 40 calories for every ounce.

First, I count the calories from the eggs. John has 6 eggs, and each egg has 75 calories, so that's 6 times 75, which is 450 calories.

Next, I count the calories from the cheese. John has 2 ounces of cheese, and each ounce has 120 calories, so that's 2 times 120, which is 240 calories.

Then, I count the calories from the ham. John has 2 ounces of ham, and each ounce has 40 calories, so that's 2 times 40, which is 80 calories.

Now, I add all these up: 450 calories from eggs, 240 calories from cheese, and 80 calories from ham. That makes 450 plus 240 plus 80, which is 770 calories.

So, the omelet has 770 calories."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. I bought 6 pencils and each one costs 50 cents. So, 6 times 50 cents is 300 cents, which is the same as $3.00. Now, I also bought 8 erasers and each one costs 25 cents. So, 8 times 25 cents is 200 cents, which is the same as $2.00. The total cost for all the pencils and erasers is $3.00 plus $2.00, which is $5.00. I gave the seller $10.00, so to find out how much change I get, I subtract $5.00 from $10.00, and that gives me $5.00. So, the change I get is $5.00."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We start with 100 people who want a job at Google. Only 30 out of these 100 people get to have an interview. So, that's 30 people.

Out of these 30 people who got an interview, 20% get a job offer. To find out how many that is, we do 30 times 20%, which is 6 people.

Now, out of these 6 people who got a job offer, a third of them accept the job. So, we take 6 and divide it by 3, which gives us 2 people.

So, the number of people who accept the job is 2."
"Goldy had 20 sacks of rice. She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. So, she gave away 3 + 4 = 7 sacks. Each sack has 25 kilograms of rice. So, the total kilograms of rice she gave away is 7 sacks * 25 kg/sack = 175 kg. 

The answer is: 175 kg."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops this week. That's 3 + 5 = 8 boxes in total this week. Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.

To find out how many more boxes she bought this week, we take the total from this week and subtract the total from last week. So, 8 - 4 = 4.

So, Castle bought 4 more boxes of cereal this week than last week. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Helga dances in two different ways. When she's dancing with her hands at her sides, she can tap her right foot 300 times a minute and her left foot 250 times a minute. So, in total, she taps 550 times a minute. When she raises her arms, she taps 200 times a minute with each foot, so that's 400 taps a minute.

She dances for 5 minutes, but she raises her arms for 2 of those minutes. So, she dances normally for 3 minutes.

Now, let's count the taps:
- For the 3 minutes she dances normally, she taps 550 times a minute, so that's \(550 \times 3 = 1650\) taps.
- For the 2 minutes she raises her arms, she taps 400 times a minute, so that's \(400 \times 2 = 800\) taps.

Adding these together, \(1650 + 800 = 2450\) taps in total.

So, the total number of taps is 2450. The answer is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ron's car could get $450 worth of damage if he doesn't fix the pothole. But if he tries to fix it himself, he has to pay a $120 fine and $25 for each of the 3 buckets of asphalt. So, $25 times 3 is $75. Adding the fine and the cost of the asphalt gives us $120 + $75 = $195.

Now, if he doesn't fix it, the car will be damaged for $450. So, to find out how much money he saves, we take the $450 and subtract the $195 he has to pay. 

$450 - $195 = $255.

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself. The answer is $255."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The restaurant started with 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. But 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs were sent to the carpenter to be fixed. 

So, we take away the fixed chairs from the total:

- Normal chairs left: 170 - 20 = 150
- Baby chairs left: 23 - 13 = 10

Now, we add the chairs that are still usable:

- Total chairs left: 150 + 10 = 160

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Bryce and his four friends each got their own pizza. Each pizza has 12 slices. So, they got 5 pizzas, and that's 5 times 12 slices, which is 60 slices in total.

Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, they ate 2/3 of 3 pizzas, which is 2 pizzas. Each pizza has 12 slices, so 2 pizzas have 2 times 12 slices, which is 24 slices.

The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. So, they ate 3/4 of 2 pizzas, which is 1 pizza. Each pizza has 12 slices, so 1 pizza has 12 slices.

Now, if we add the slices eaten by the first group and the second group, we get 24 slices plus 12 slices, which is 36 slices in total.

So, the slices left are 60 slices minus 36 slices, which is 24 slices.

So, the number of slices left is 24."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a cat that eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. A dog can eat the same amount of sausages but in less time. The dog takes 2/3 of the time the cat takes, so we calculate that as follows:

\[
\text{Time for the dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, to find out how long it takes on average for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages, we add their times together and then divide by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is 25 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Topher's shoe is 100 inches long. The problem says that Topher's shoe length is 10 inches more than 9 times Bobby's shoe length. So, if we let Bobby's shoe length be \( x \) inches, then we have:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To find \( x \), we need to do a few steps. First, we take away 10 from 100:

\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]

So, we have:

\[ 90 = 9x \]

Now, to find \( x \), we divide 90 by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

So, Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Hannah smashes windows in the parking lot. There are 64 cars with students and each has 4 windows, so that's 64 times 4, which is 256 windows. There are also 32 cars with teachers and each has 2 windows, so that's 32 times 2, which is 64 windows.

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' windows, so that's 256 divided by 4, which is 64 windows. She also smashes three-quarters of the teachers' windows, so that's 64 times 3/4, which is 48 windows.

Now, to find out how many windows she smashes in total, we add the windows from the students and the teachers: 64 plus 48, which is 112 windows.

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is 112."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Candy has different colors of spools of thread. She has 15 light blue ones, 45 dark blue ones, 40 light green ones, and 50 dark green ones. We want to know what percentage of these spools are blue.

First, we add up all the spools:
- Light blue: 15
- Dark blue: 45
- Light green: 40
- Dark green: 50

So, the total number of spools is 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150.

Now, we count the blue spools:
- Light blue: 15
- Dark blue: 45

So, the total number of blue spools is 15 + 45 = 60.

To find out what percentage of the spools are blue, we use this formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of the spools are blue. The answer is 40%."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. At the start, there were 5000 people waiting to vote. By lunchtime, which we can call midday, 2 out of every 5 people voted. So, we calculate 2000 people voted by midday because 5000 times 2/5 equals 2000.

After lunch, 3000 people were left because 5000 minus 2000 equals 3000.

By the end of the day, which is 4:00 PM, or 16:00, 2 out of every 3 of the remaining people voted. So, 2000 people voted by 16:00 because 3000 times 2/3 equals 2000.

That means 1000 people didn't vote by 16:00 because 3000 minus 2000 equals 1000.

So, the number of people who didn't vote by 16:00 is 1000."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Parker eats 4 pieces of gum every day. A pack of gum has 15 pieces in it. We want to know how many packs he needs for 30 days.

First, we find out how many pieces of gum he eats in 30 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of gum he needs to get 120 pieces. Since each pack has 15 pieces:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker needs 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days. The answer is 8 packs."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We need to make 24 smores. Each sleeve of graham crackers can make 8 smores. So, we need 3 sleeves to make 24 smores because 24 divided by 8 is 3. And since there are 3 sleeves in a box, we only need 1 box to have 3 sleeves. So, they will need 1 box of graham crackers."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Dora is 15 years old. Her daddy is older than Dora by a lot. The daddy's age is calculated by taking twice Dora's age (which is 2 times 15) and then adding 8 more years. So, 2 times 15 is 30, and adding 8 more makes it 38. So, Dora's daddy is 38 years old.

Now, Dora's mommy is younger than her daddy by 4 years. So, if Dora's daddy is 38, then Dora's mommy is 38 minus 4, which is 34.

To find out the total age of Dora, her daddy, and her mommy, we add their ages together: 15 (Dora) + 38 (Daddy) + 34 (Mommy) = 87.

So, the total combined age is 87."

"Okay, let me break it down simply. Cindy has two math and science books that each weigh 2 pounds, so that's 4 pounds. She also has a French book that weighs 4 pounds and an English book that weighs 3 pounds. Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so that's 2 times 3 pounds, which is 6 pounds. Now, if we add all these up: 4 (math and science) + 4 (French) + 3 (English) + 6 (history) = 17 pounds. So, the total weight of all her books is 17 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 100 people voting. Candidate A got 20 out of 100 votes, which is 20%. Candidate B got 50% more than Candidate A, so that's 30% of the votes. To find out how many votes Candidate B got, we calculate 50% of 20, which is 10, and add that to Candidate A's 20 votes, making it 30 votes for Candidate B. Now, to find out how many votes Candidate C got, we subtract the votes of A and B from the total votes. So, 100 minus 20 (for A) and 30 (for B) equals 50 votes for Candidate C. Therefore, Candidate C got 50 votes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Boris starts with 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer, so Beck starts with 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Boris has 100 - 10 = 90 apples, and Beck has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract Beck's apples from Boris's apples: 90 - 87 = 3.

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The answer is 3."

Peter has 32 ounces of water. He makes giant cubes, medium cubes, and small cubes. He makes 3 giant cubes, each using 4 ounces, so that's 3 times 4, which is 12 ounces. Then he makes 7 medium cubes, each using 2 ounces, so that's 7 times 2, which is 14 ounces. And he makes 8 small cubes, each using half an ounce, so that's 8 times half, which is 4 ounces.

Now, if we add up all the water he uses, it's 12 ounces for the giant cubes, 14 ounces for the medium cubes, and 4 ounces for the small cubes. So, 12 plus 14 plus 4 is 30 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces, and he used 30 ounces, so he has 2 ounces left. 

So, the answer is 2 ounces."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We know Clara has 20 books and she has twice as many books as Steven. So, if Clara has 20 books, Steven must have half that, which is 10 books. Now, Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books. Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice. So the answer is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Cecelia went to buy milk. She found out that a big jar (gallon) costs $5. Now, a smaller jar (half-gallon) costs $2 less than the big jar. So, the small jar costs $5 - $2 = $3.

Now, Cecelia wants to buy 10 big jars and 16 small jars. 

First, let's see how much 10 big jars cost:
- Each big jar costs $5.
- So, 10 big jars cost 10 × $5 = $50.

Next, let's see how much 16 small jars cost:
- Each small jar costs $3.
- So, 16 small jars cost 16 × $3 = $48.

Now, to find out the total amount Cecelia spent, we add the cost of the big jars and the small jars together:
- $50 (for the big jars) + $48 (for the small jars) = $98.

So, Cecelia spent $98 in total. The answer is $98."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a class of 50 students. Out of them, 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. That means we have \(50 - 10 - 5 = 35\) students left who like to play video games or play music.

The problem says that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 like to play basketball, then \(2 \times 5 = 10\) students like to play music.

So, the rest, which is 35 students, like to play video games. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is 25.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Oh, okay. So Jeremy saw 12 birds in his backyard. He threw a stone and scared away some birds, one-third of 12 is 4 birds, so that leaves him with 8 birds. Then, after a while, 20 more birds came to join them. So now he has 8 plus 20 birds, which makes 28 birds. So the total number of birds in the backyard is 28."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have two classes with a total of 80 students. Since the classes have the same number of students, each class has 40 students. Now, in each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find out how many girls are in each class, we calculate 40% of 40, which is 16 girls. So, if each class has 40 students and 16 of them are girls, the rest must be boys. To find out how many boys there are, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class. So, 40 minus 16 equals 24 boys. Therefore, there are 24 boys in each class. The answer is 24."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, we start with 2 slices of cake. Mara adds 3 more slices, making it 5 slices in total. Then Mara makes the number of slices 3 times bigger, so 5 times 3 is 15 slices. Mara eats 2 slices, so now there are 15 minus 2, which is 13 slices. Then her friend takes 5 slices, so now there are 13 minus 5, which is 8 slices left.

So, the number of cake slices that remain on the plate is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Melissa has to groom different animals like dogs, cats, birds, and horses. She has 8 dogs, 5 cats, 3 birds, and 12 horses. If we add all these up, we get:
\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]
So, she has 28 animals to groom.

Now, she wants to do this over 7 days of the week. To find out how many animals she grooms each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:
\[ 28 \div 7 = 4 \]

So, Melissa grooms 4 animals each day. The answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Mark bought 3 packs of magic cards for $1800 each. So, he spent a total of $5400. He got some cards from opening these packs. He got one card worth $4000, another worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. 

So, the total value of the cards he got is $4000 + $1000 + (30 × $50) = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500. 

To find out how much money he made, we subtract the money he spent from the value of the cards he got: $6500 - $5400 = $1100.

So, Mark made a profit of $1100. 

The answer is: **$1100**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have two parks. In the first park, it costs $26 for each grown-up and $12 for each kid. There are 2 grown-ups and 2 kids in Jake's family. So, for the grown-ups, it's 2 times $26, which is $52. For the kids, it's 2 times $12, which is $24. So, the total cost for the first park is $52 plus $24, which is $76.

Now, in the second park, it costs $14 for each grown-up and $10 for each kid. Again, there are 2 grown-ups and 2 kids. So, for the grown-ups, it's 2 times $14, which is $28. For the kids, it's 2 times $10, which is $20. So, the total cost for the second park is $28 plus $20, which is $48.

Now, to find out how much they can save, we take the cost of the first park and subtract the cost of the second park. So, $76 minus $48 is $28.

So, Jake's family can save $28 by choosing the second park. The answer is $28."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The tomato vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day for $0.5 each. So, he spent $250 a day. Now, he's buying them for $0.4 each. So, he spends $200 a day now.

The difference is $250 - $200 = $50. That's how much he saves each day.

There are 7 days in a week, so he saves $50 \times 7 = $350 a week.

So, the answer is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know Sean has 56 marbles. Now, Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so Carl has 4 times 56, which is 224 marbles. Sean also has half as many marbles as Cal, so Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean, which is 2 times 56, making Cal have 112 marbles. If we add Carl's and Cal's marbles together, we get 224 plus 112, which is 336. So, the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have together is 336."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have 54 students and we want to make groups. If we make 6 groups, each group will have 9 students because 54 divided by 6 is 9. But the activity needs 12 groups. So, we need to find out how many more groups we need to make.

If we make 12 groups, we can't have each group have the same number of students because 54 divided by 12 doesn't give us a whole number. But if we stick to making 6 groups, each group has 9 students.

To make 12 groups, we need to add more groups. Since we already have 6 groups, we need to make 6 more groups to reach 12 groups.

So, the number of additional groups needed is 6.

The answer is: **6**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine Candy has a chair business. During the weekdays, she rents out 60 chairs each day, and during the weekends, she rents out 100 chairs each day. Now, a month has 4 weeks, and each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.

So, in one month:
- She rents out 60 chairs/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks = 1200 chairs during weekdays.
- She rents out 100 chairs/day * 2 days/week * 4 weeks = 800 chairs during weekends.

So, in one month, she rents out 1200 + 800 = 2000 chairs.

Now, if we want to know how many chairs she rents out in two months, we just double that:
2000 chairs * 2 = 4000 chairs.

So, Candy will be able to rent out 4000 chairs in two 4-week months. The answer is 4000 chairs."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

At first, Gunther had 48 bananas. Arnold, the chimp, took half of them, so that's 48 divided by 2, which is 24. So, Gunther was left with 48 minus 24, which is 24 bananas.

Then, Gunther added 25 more bananas, so he had 24 plus 25, which is 49 bananas.

Arnold took 12 more bananas, so now Gunther had 49 minus 12, which is 37 bananas.

Finally, Gunther added 6 more bananas, so he had 37 plus 6, which is 43 bananas.

So, the number of bananas Gunther found is 43."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jenna and her 4 roommates share the electricity bill. Each month, they pay $100 in total. We need to find out how much each person pays in a year.

First, we see how much each person pays each month. If they all share $100 and there are 4 people, we divide $100 by 4. That gives us $25 per person each month.

Now, to find out how much each person pays in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 (because there are 12 months in a year). So, $25 times 12 is $300.

So, each roommate pays $300 a year for electricity."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way.

Jeff sent out 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 times 12, so that's 96 glasses. He also sent out 4 dozen plates, which is 4 times 12, so that's 48 plates.

When they came back, 10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were broken. So, to find out how many glasses and plates are left, we take away the broken ones from the ones sent out.

For the glasses, we have 96 sent out and 10 broken, so we do 96 minus 10, which gives us 86 glasses left.

For the plates, we have 48 sent out and 6 broken, so we do 48 minus 6, which gives us 42 plates left.

Now, to find out the total number of items left, we add the glasses and plates together: 86 glasses plus 42 plates equals 128 items.

So, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates left. The answer is 128."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers, which is 27 small stickers, for 27 large buttons. So now she has 27 large buttons and 3 small stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers, which is 20 large stickers, for 20 large buttons. She also trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

So, in total, she has 27 large buttons from the first trade, 20 large buttons from the second trade, and 60 small buttons. Adding these up, she has 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 buttons.

So, the final number of buttons Lorraine has is 107."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Last week, Joey played football like this:
- On Monday, he played 2 matches.
- On Friday, he played 1 match.
- On Saturday, he played double the matches he played on Monday, so that's 2 times 2, which is 4 matches.

Now, if we add up all the matches he played:
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 4 matches

So, 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 matches in total.

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is 7."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Imagine there are 33 people in the council. If 11 people voted against the new rule, then the rest must have voted for it. Since the votes for are twice the votes against, that means if 11 voted against, then 22 must have voted for it.

So, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Krissa needs to order shirts for her preschool students. Here's how many she needs for each size:

- Extra-small (XS): 11 students
- Small (S): Twice as many as extra-small, so 22 students
- Medium (M): Four less than small, so 22 - 4 = 18 students
- Large (L): Half as many as medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students
- Extra-large (XL): Six more than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students

Now, to find out how many shirts she needs to order, I'll add them all up:

11 (XS) + 22 (S) + 18 (M) + 9 (L) + 15 (XL) = 75 shirts

So, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total."
"Okay, let's break it down simply. If the bag is marked at $140 and there's a 5% discount, we first find out what 5% of $140 is. 

To find 5% of $140, we do:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 140 = 0.05 \times 140 = 7 \]

So, the discount is $7. Now, we subtract this discount from the original price:
\[ 140 - 7 = 133 \]

Therefore, after the discount, you would pay $133."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John has 20 playlists, and each playlist has 300 songs. So, if we multiply those numbers, we get 6000 songs in total. Now, each song is 10 hours long. So, if we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song, we get the total hours.

So, 6000 songs times 10 hours per song equals 60,000 hours. That's how many hours all the playlists will last in total.

The answer is: 60,000 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We start with 50 people. 20% of them think horse #2 will win. So, 20% of 50 is 10 people. That leaves us with 50 - 10 = 40 people.

Out of these 40 people, 60% think horse #7 will win. So, 60% of 40 is 24 people. That leaves us with 40 - 24 = 16 people.

So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16.

The answer is: **16**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Jana has some puppies, and out of those, two out of every three are Pomeranians. Now, one out of every three of those Pomeranians is a girl, and we know there are 6 girls.

So, if we think about it, if 6 is one out of every three Pomeranians, then if we have three times that number, we get the total number of Pomeranian puppies. Three times 6 is 18. That means Jana has 18 Pomeranian puppies.

Since those 18 Pomeranian puppies are two out of every three of all her puppies, we can find out the total number of puppies by saying, if 18 is two out of every three, then three times 18 gives us the total number of puppies. Three times 18 is 54.

So, Jana has 54 puppies in total. The answer is 54."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jayden had $70 from selling pictures. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115.

The camera costs $200, so to find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract what he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85.

So, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera. The answer is $85."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have three houses and we know the total number of shingles needed is 250. The first house needs half of what the second house needs, and the third house needs twice what the first house needs.

So, if we say the second house needs \( x \) shingles, then the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) and the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) shingles.

If we add them all up, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then we divide by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 shingles. The third house, which needs twice what the first house needs, also needs 100 shingles.

Therefore, the third house needs 100 shingles."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Leila buys 3 cucumbers, and each cucumber costs $2. So, she spends:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]
dollars on cucumbers.

Jack buys 5 tomatoes, and each tomato costs $1. So, he spends:
\[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \]
dollars on tomatoes.

Chase buys 1 head of lettuce, and it costs $3. So, he spends:
\[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]
dollars on lettuce.

Now, to find out how much they all spent together, we add up what each of them spent:
\[ 6 + 5 + 3 = 14 \]

So, the total amount they spent is $14."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

George has 200 bananas. Now, he has 45% more pears than bananas. So, to find out how many pears he has, we take 45% of 200 bananas, which is 90. So, George has 200 bananas plus 90 pears, which makes 290 pears.

Now, to find out how many fruits he has in total, we add the bananas and pears together. So, 200 bananas plus 290 pears equals 490 fruits.

So, the total number of fruits George has is 490."
"Marissa had $80 and she spent $20 on a ball, so she had $60 left. Candy bars cost $5 each, so with $60, she could buy 12 candy bars. So, the number of candy bars she bought for her brother Jimmy is 12. The answer is 12."
"To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges, and each kilogram costs $3. So, for 4 liters of juice, we need 4 times 5 kilograms of oranges, which is 20 kilograms. Since each kilogram costs $3, 20 kilograms will cost 20 times $3, which is $60. So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

The correct answer is: **$60**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Ahmed read 150 books in one hour. Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, so that means Ezra read 300 books. But then Ezra decided to read 150 more books, so he ended up reading 450 books in total.

Now, to find out how many books they read altogether, we add Ahmed's books to Ezra's books. So, 150 (Ahmed's books) + 450 (Ezra's books) = 600 books.

So, the total number of books they read together is 600."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Tanya teaches for different days and different numbers of classes. We need to find out how much she earned.

On Monday, she teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each. So, she earns:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = \$300 \]
She also gets an extra $5 because she taught more than 3 classes.
So, her total for Monday is:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each. So, she earns:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]
She doesn't get the extra $5 because she taught only 2 classes.
So, her total for Wednesday is:
\[ \$60 \]

Now, we add the totals for both days:
\[ \$305 + \$60 = \$365 \]

So, Tanya earned a total of \$365. The answer is \(\boxed{365}\)."

The company had 5 vanilla scents sold and 2 fruity scents sold. To find out how many more vanilla scents were sold, we do this:

First, we count the vanilla scents: 5 vanilla scents.
Then, we count the fruity scents: 2 fruity scents.

Now, we subtract the fruity scents from the vanilla scents:
5 - 2 = 3

So, 3 more vanilla scents were sold than fruity scents. But the question asks how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, and the answer is 3 more.

If we had to choose from the options given, the answer would be 3."
"Bennet sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, so he makes $60 from the eggplants. He wants to make a total of $135, so he needs $75 more. He has 25 ears of corn, and he wants to make $75 from them. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, he divides $75 by 25 ears. 

So, $75 ÷ 25 = $3 per ear of corn. 

Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3. 

The answer is: **$3**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Tatiana has 12 hours in total over the weekend to do different things. She spends 3 hours reading and 3 hours playing video games. That's 6 hours already used up. So, she has 6 hours left to play soccer. To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we take the 6 hours she plays soccer and divide it by the total 12 hours, then multiply by 100. So, it's 6/12 times 100, which is 50%. Therefore, she spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer. The answer is 50%."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave half of them to Brandon, so he gave 25 pencils to Brandon. That leaves him with 25 pencils. Then he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. So, he gave 3/5 of 25, which is 15 pencils to Charlie. After giving those 15 pencils to Charlie, he has 10 pencils left. So, the number of pencils Anthony kept is 10."
"Jack drives 150 miles to the museum and 150 miles back home. He drives at 75 mph, so the time to drive each way is 150 miles divided by 75 mph, which is 2 hours. So, the total driving time is 2 hours to the museum plus 2 hours back, which is 4 hours. He spends 6 hours at the museum. So, the total time Jack is gone from home is 4 hours driving plus 6 hours at the museum, which is 10 hours. 

So, the answer is 10 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Henry needs wheels for his toys. He needs 4 wheels for each car and he has 57 cars. So, for the cars, he needs:
\[ 4 \times 57 = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

For the motorcycles, he needs 2 wheels for each of the 73 motorcycles. So, for the motorcycles, he needs:
\[ 2 \times 73 = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Now, if he adds the wheels needed for the cars and the wheels needed for the motorcycles, he needs:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has a box with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels are left after he uses the wheels for the toys, he subtracts the wheels he needs from the wheels he has:
\[ 650 - 374 = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

So, the number of wheels left is 276. 

The answer is: 276"
"Sure, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The laptop costs $1000, and there's a 20% discount on it. To find out how much you have to pay after the discount, we first figure out what 20% of $1000 is. 

20% of $1000 is $200 (because 20% is the same as 20 out of 100, and 1000 divided by 100 is 10, so 20 times 10 is 200).

Now, if we take $200 off the original price of $1000, we get $800.

So, after the discount, you have to pay $800.

The answer is: **$800**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Mike has 600 movies. A third of them are in series, so that's 200 movies. The rest are 400 movies. Out of these 400, 40% are older movies, so that's 160 movies. That leaves 240 movies that are not older.

The series movies cost $6 each, so that's 200 movies at $6 each, which is $1200.
The non-older movies cost $10 each, so that's 240 movies at $10 each, which is $2400.
The older movies cost $5 each, so that's 160 movies at $5 each, which is $800.

If we add all these up, we get $1200 + $2400 + $800 = $4400.

So, the total cost to replace all his movies is $4400."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Winston picked peaches, plums, and apricots. He bought peaches for $2.00 a pound, plums for $1.00 a pound, and apricots for $3.00 a pound. He picked 6 pounds of peaches, 8 pounds of plums, and 6 pounds of apricots.

First, for the peaches, he spent \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.
Then, for the plums, he spent \(8 \times 1 = 8\) dollars.
And for the apricots, he spent \(6 \times 3 = 18\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much he spent in total, we add up all these amounts:
\(12 + 8 + 18 = 38\) dollars.

So, Winston spent 38 dollars on fruit. The answer is 38."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The family drove for 6 hours at 50 miles an hour, so they drove 300 miles. They also hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed that was 5 miles an hour less than half of 50 miles an hour. Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles an hour less than that is 20 miles an hour. So, they hiked 20 miles an hour for 1.5 hours, which is 30 miles. If you add the miles they drove and the miles they hiked, you get 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles. So, their vacation spot is 330 miles away."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Ava and Emma are playing a game where they get points for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and how much time they have left. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries. But she finishes 4 seconds slower.

Ava gets 10 points for each enemy she jumps on, so for 8 more enemies, she gets 80 points. She also gets 5 points for each berry, so for 3 more berries, she gets 15 points. But she loses 30 points for every second she's slower, so for 4 seconds, she loses 120 points.

So, Ava's total score is 80 + 15 - 120 = -25.

Emma doesn't get any points for the extra enemies or berries because she didn't do those things. She loses 30 points for every second she's slower, so for 4 seconds, she loses 120 points.

So, Emma's total score is -120.

Now, to find out how much more points Ava got than Emma, we do -25 - (-120) = -25 + 120 = 95.

So, the difference between their scores is 95 points. If we look at the choices, the closest and correct answer would be 95 points.

The answer is: 95 points."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Four friends ordered four pizzas that cost a total of 64 dollars. Two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each. So, the other two pizzas together cost 64 - 30 - 30 = 4 dollars. Since these two pizzas cost the same, each one costs 4 / 2 = 2 dollars. So, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Imagine Chase and Rider have a bike riding plan. They ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days. That's 3 times 5, which is 15 rides. But on two other days, they ride their bikes twice as much as usual. So, on those days, they ride their bikes 6 times a day (because 3 times 2 is 6). That's 6 times 2, which is 12 rides. Now, if we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days, we get 15 plus 12, which is 27 rides in total. So, they ride their bikes 27 times in a week."
"Oh, hello there! Let me try to figure this out for you. So, Bob had 7 fish in his pond, 3 of them were orange and 4 were white. He went to the pet store and got 17 more fish. When he got them home, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Now, I'm not sure how to do this, but let's think it through.

If he got 17 fish, and we know that 3 were orange and 4 were white, that's 7 fish already. So, the rest must be the 17 fish he got. Now, if he ends up with twice as many orange as white fish, let's say he got some white fish and some orange fish. If he got 4 white fish already, he must have gotten 13 more fish to make it 17. Let's see, if he got 13 more fish, and we know 3 were orange, then he must have gotten 10 more white fish to make it twice as many as the 3 orange ones.

So, he must have gotten 10 white fish. That means he got 7 orange fish too, making it 17 fish in total. If he had 3 orange and 4 white, and now he has 13 orange and 10 white, that makes 23 orange and 14 white, which is twice as many orange as white.

So, the number of white fish he bought is 10."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Andy's car can go 10 miles on one gallon of gas. If he drives 5 miles to work and back, that's 10 miles a day. He does this from Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days a week. So, he drives 50 miles in a week.

His car needs 5 gallons of gas to drive 50 miles because 50 miles divided by 10 miles per gallon equals 5 gallons.

If gas costs $3 for one gallon, then for 5 gallons, it would cost 5 times 3, which is 15 dollars.

So, Andy spends 15 dollars on gas each week. The answer is 15 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Carrie got some money from her aunt. She got ten twenties, which is like ten $20 bills, so that's $200. She also got 140 quarters, and each quarter is like a small coin worth $0.25. So, 140 quarters is $35.

Now, she spent all the quarters, which is $35. She also spent 3/5 of the twenties. 3/5 of $200 is $120. So, she spent $120 on the twenties.

To find out how much she spent in total, we add the $35 she spent on quarters to the $120 she spent on twenties. That makes $155 in total.

So, the total amount of money she paid for lunch is $155."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ricardo has tomato plants and eggplant plants. Each tomato plant gives him 22 tomatoes, and each eggplant plant gives him 4 eggplants. He has 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants.

First, we count the tomatoes:
- 5 tomato plants times 22 tomatoes each equals 110 tomatoes.

Next, we count the eggplants:
- 8 eggplant plants times 4 eggplants each equals 32 eggplants.

Now, we add the tomatoes and eggplants together:
- 110 tomatoes plus 32 eggplants equals 142 fruits.

So, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants. The answer is 142."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Samwell sold 40 TVs in total. He sold one-fourth of them as smart TVs, which is 10 TVs. Then he sold one-eighth as analog TVs, which is 5 TVs. The rest are OLED TVs.

To find out how many OLED TVs he sold, we take the total number of TVs and subtract the smart TVs and analog TVs he sold:

40 (total TVs) - 10 (smart TVs) - 5 (analog TVs) = 25 OLED TVs.

So, Samwell sold 25 OLED TVs."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. John needs $300 for the trip. The school is giving him half of that, so the school will give him $150. John already has $50. So, he needs $300 - $150 = $150 from the school, and he still needs $150 - $50 = $100 more. So, John is missing $100."
"Oh, okay. So, let me figure this out step by step, like I'm not so smart.

First, we know the house gets cold at night. During the day, it's 45 degrees. At night, it's 33 degrees colder, so that makes it 12 degrees at night.

Now, the pipes freeze if the house gets below 32 degrees. So, we need to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees to keep the pipes safe.

To do that, we need to raise the temperature by:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood can raise the temperature by 5 degrees. So, to raise it by 20 degrees, we need:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to keep the pipes from freezing. The answer is 4 logs."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

There were 90 people going on a trip. They split into groups of 9 people each. So, they made 10 groups.

Now, 3 out of every 5 groups brought back seashells. That means 6 groups brought back seashells because 3/5 of 10 is 6.

Each of those 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. So, 6 groups times 2 seashells each equals 12 seashells in total.

So, the total number of seashells they brought back is 12."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We start with 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people leave and 13 new people come on. So, we take away 47 from 172 and then add 13. That's like saying 172 minus 47 equals 125, and then 125 plus 13 equals 138. So, after the first stop, there are 138 people on the train.

Then at the next stop, 38 people leave. So, we take 38 from 138. That's 138 minus 38, which equals 100.

So, at the end, there are 100 people on the train."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day. If he does this for 30 days, he'll have:
\[ 10 \text{ caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ caps} \]

Each bottle cap is worth $0.25. So, if he has 300 bottle caps, the money he gets is:
\[ 300 \text{ caps} \times $0.25/\text{cap} = $75 \]

So, in a 30-day month, Damien makes $75. The answer is $75."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jamie works 8 hours a day at $20 per hour. So, for those 8 hours, she earns:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

She worked 11 hours in total, so the extra 3 hours she worked are at a special rate. Her special rate is 150% of her regular rate, which is:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

For the extra 3 hours, she earns:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

So, her total earnings for the day are:
\[ 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on last Tuesday."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. Now, she counts half as many male lions as female lions, so that would be 12 divided by 2, which is 6 male lions. And she also counts 14 lion cubs.

So, to find out how many lions there are in total, we add all these up: 12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32 lions.

So, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32."
"Mike wanted to buy his favorite jeans that were on sale for 25% off. The original price was $40.00, so he got a discount of 25% of $40.00, which is $10.00. So, the jeans cost him $40.00 - $10.00 = $30.00. If he paid with a $50.00 bill, he would have $50.00 - $30.00 = $20.00 left over. So, the money Mike will have left over is $20.00. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{20.00} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The company starts with 200 employees. Every month, they hire 20 new employees. So after 3 months, they will have hired 20 new employees each month for 3 months, which is 20 * 3 = 60 new employees. So the total number of employees after 3 months is 200 (initial) + 60 (new) = 260 employees.

Each employee gets $4000 a month. So, the company pays 260 employees * $4000 each month = $1,040,000 a month.

Now, we need to find out how much they pay in 3 months. So, $1,040,000 a month * 3 months = $3,120,000.

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after 3 months is $3,120,000."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. Carrie and the choir are going to sing two songs. They sing ""Deck the Halls"" twice, and each time it takes 150 seconds. So, for ""Deck the Halls"" they'll spend 150 seconds x 2 = 300 seconds. Then they sing ""Jingle Bells"" once, and it takes 240 seconds. So, for ""Jingle Bells"" they'll spend 240 seconds. Now, to find out how long they'll be caroling in total, we add the time for both songs: 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds. So, they'll be caroling for 540 seconds."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easy to understand.

Billy was first paid $10 an hour. After 2 months, he got a raise to $10.50 an hour. Then, on his first anniversary, he got another raise to $11.50 an hour. So, for the first 2 months, he worked at $10 an hour, then at $10.50 for the next 2 months, and then at $11.50 for the rest of the time.

Sally started at a bit less than Billy, at $10.50 an hour, but she worked the same hours as Billy.

Now, if Billy worked 20 hours at each of these rates, we can calculate how much he earned:
- For the first 2 months at $10 an hour: 2 months * 20 hours/month = 40 hours. So, 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.
- For the next 2 months at $10.50 an hour: 20 hours/month * 2 months = 40 hours. So, 40 hours * $10.50/hour = $420.
- For the rest of the time at $11.50 an hour: 20 hours/month * 6 months = 120 hours. So, 120 hours * $11.50/hour = $1,380.

Adding these up, Billy's total earnings are $400 + $420 + $1,380 = $2,200.

Sally worked the same hours at $10.50 an hour, so her total earnings are 20 hours/month * 8 months * $10.50/hour = 160 hours * $10.50/hour = $1,680.

To find out how much more Billy earned than Sally, we subtract Sally's total from Billy's total: $2,200 - $1,680 = $520.

So, Billy earned $520 more than Sally. The answer is $520."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without the original answer.

The bread costs $2 for one loaf. So, for 3 loaves, it would be 3 times $2, which is $6.

Bagels cost $1 each. So, for 2 bagels, it would be 2 times $1, which is $2.

Now, to find out how much more the bread costs than the bagels, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread. So, $6 minus $2 is $4.

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels. The answer is $4."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Pierson scored 278 points. Nikita scored 11 more than half of what Pierson scored. So, half of Pierson's score is 278 divided by 2, which is 139. Then, 139 plus 11 is 150. So, Nikita scored 150 points.

Now, to find out how many points they both scored together, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score. That's 278 plus 150, which equals 428.

So, the total points they scored together is 428."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. At Ashley's school, there are 40 classes. Each class has 25 students, so that's 1000 students in total. There are also 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers, so that's 120 teachers in total.

Now, each student plants 1 tree, so 1000 students will plant 1000 trees. Each teacher plants 2 trees, so 120 teachers will plant 240 trees.

If we add the trees planted by the students and the teachers together, we get:
1000 trees (from students) + 240 trees (from teachers) = 1240 trees.

So, at the end of the campaign, they will have planted 1240 trees. The answer is 1240."
"Bubbles has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. That makes a total of 14 stuffed animals. She wants the stuffed goats to be 30% of all her stuffed animals. To find out how many goats she needs, we can set up the equation where the number of goats (x) is 30% of the total number of stuffed animals. 

So, we have:
\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Solving this, we get:
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats. The answer is 6."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Kris wants to play 30 hours to get a game achievement. She played half an hour every day for 2 weeks, which is 14 days. So, she played 7 hours in those 2 weeks. Then for the next week, she played 2 hours every day, which is 7 days, so she played 14 hours. Adding these up, she played 7 + 14 = 21 hours. To get the achievement, she needs 30 hours, so she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours. So, the answer is 9 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without the original answer.

Two cars are on the road. One car is going 60 miles in an hour, and the other is going 70 miles in an hour. They both drive for 2 hours.

- The first car, going 60 miles per hour, will have traveled 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles.
- The second car, going 70 miles per hour, will have traveled 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles.

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be ahead of the first car by 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

The number of miles that will separate them after 2 hours is 20 miles. So, the correct answer is 20 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. James bought a ring for his girlfriend. The diamond cost him $600 and the gold cost him $300. So, the ring cost him $600 + $300 = $900. But he also had to pay an extra 30% because it was made extra special. To find out how much extra he had to pay, we calculate 30% of $900, which is 0.30 * $900 = $270. So, the total cost of the ring is $900 + $270 = $1170. Therefore, James paid $1170 for the ring."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easy to understand.

Janet is looking at the results of a test that was given at Herbert Hoover Elementary School. She found out that 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, and 400 fifth-graders had a pass rate that was twice as good as the fourth graders.

To find out the overall pass rate, we need to add up all the students who passed and divide by the total number of students.

For third graders:
- 340 out of 500 passed, which is 340/500 = 0.68 or 68%.

For fourth graders:
- 40 out of 100 passed, which is 40/100 = 0.40 or 40%.

For fifth graders:
- The pass rate is twice that of fourth graders, so it's 2 * 0.40 = 0.80 or 80%.

Now, let's add up all the pass students:
- Third graders: 340
- Fourth graders: 40
- Fifth graders: 400 * 2 = 800

Total pass students = 340 + 40 + 800 = 1180

But we need to count the total number of students:
- Third graders: 500
- Fourth graders: 100
- Fifth graders: 400

Total students = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000

Now, to find the overall pass rate, we divide the total number of pass students by the total number of students:
- Overall pass rate = 1180 / 1000 = 1.18 or 118%.

So, the school's overall pass rate is 118%."
"Milo needs 12 chips to make one square inch of his mosaic. He has two bags of chips, and each bag has 72 chips, so he has 144 chips in total. If he wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we need to find out how long he can make it with 144 chips.

First, we figure out how many square inches he can make with 144 chips. Since 12 chips make one square inch, he can make:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Now, if he wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall, we can find out how long it can be by dividing the total square inches by the height:

\[ \text{Length} = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The answer is:

4 inches"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

At the party, some students drank tea, and we know how much they drank. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts, so that's 6 quarts. Then, 16 students each drank 2 quarts, so that's 32 quarts. Adding these up, 6 quarts plus 32 quarts equals 38 quarts of tea were drunk.

Now, we know there were 10 quarts left over. So, to find out how much tea was there at the start, we add the tea that was drunk to the tea that was left over. That's 38 quarts plus 10 quarts, which makes 48 quarts.

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we divide 48 quarts by 4 to find out how many gallons there were. 48 divided by 4 is 12 gallons.

So, the answer is 12 gallons."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Dale started with 100 candies and sold 150. But he only had 100, so he needed more. Then he got 100 more candies. Now he has 200 candies in total.

He already sold 150, so he needs to sell 50 more to have all the candies sold.

So, the number of candies Dale still needs to sell is 50.

The answer is: **50**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

At the start of the year, there are 10 students. Every month, the number of students doubles. So, by the end of January, there are 20 students. By February, it's 40 students. By March, it's 80 students. By April, it's 160 students. And by May, it's 320 students.

Now, to find out how many more students joined by the end of May, we take the number of students at the end of May and subtract the number at the start of the year. So, 320 minus 10 equals 310.

So, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Felix makes money by climbing trees to get things out of them. He charges 25 cents for each branch he climbs. He made $105 in a week. To find out how many branches he climbed, we divide $105 by 25 cents. 

$105 is the same as 10500 cents. So, 10500 cents divided by 25 cents per branch is 420 branches. Felix worked for 7 days in a week, so to find out how many branches he climbed each day, we divide 420 branches by 7 days.

420 divided by 7 is 60. So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches each day.

The answer is 60 branches per day."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Rose picks flowers and counts the petals. She starts with 3 flowers that have 5 petals each. That's 3 times 5, which is 15 petals. Then she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each, which is 4 times 6, so that's 24 petals. Next, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each, which is 5 times 4, so that's 20 petals. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each, which is 6 times 7, so that's 42 petals.

Now, if we add all these together, we get:
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.

But then she drops 1 flower of each type. So she drops 15 petals, 24 petals, 20 petals, and 42 petals. That's 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals dropped.

So, she had 101 petals and dropped 101 petals. That means she has 0 petals left in the vase.

So the answer is: 0 petals."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John and DeSean had a big bag of 35 marshmallows. John made 9 S'mores, and DeSean also made 9 S'mores. That's 18 marshmallows used. Then, they dropped 3 more marshmallows on the ground. So, they used 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows in total.

Now, they had 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows left. Since they have 14 marshmallows left and they want to share them equally, each of them can have 14 ÷ 2 = 7 marshmallows.

So, each of them can have 7 S'mores. The answer is 7."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. His two friends who are worse can each play for half that time, so 10 minutes each. The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so that's 30 minutes.

They all play together for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. Now, we need to figure out how many quarters they use to play for 240 minutes.

Jack plays 20 minutes, his two worse friends play 10 minutes each (so 20 minutes total), and the better friend plays 30 minutes. That's a total of 60 minutes they can play with one quarter.

To find out how many quarters they need, we divide the total playtime by the time one quarter lets them play:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \]

So, they use 12 quarters. The answer is 12 quarters."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Tanya makes a special scrub and she uses different amounts of each ingredient. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the same amount of salt as sugar, twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest.

She uses 10 ounces of the scrub in total. If we say the amount of salt she uses is \( S \) ounces, then:
- The amount of oil she uses is \( 2S \) ounces.
- The amount of fragrance is \( S \) ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is \( S \) ounces.
- The amount of sugar is \( S \) ounces.

So, if we add all these up, we get:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, to find out how much oil she uses, we multiply the amount of salt by 2:
\[ 2S = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, Tanya uses \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces of oil. The answer is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. John bought 3 goats, and each goat cost $500. So, for the goats, he spent 3 times $500, which is $1500. Then, he bought 2 cows, and each cow cost $1500. So, for the cows, he spent 2 times $1500, which is $3000. To find out how much he spent in total, we add the cost of the goats and the cows together. So, $1500 plus $3000 equals $4500. Therefore, John spent $4500 in total."
"Paul already has 8 chocolate and 40 toffee cupcakes, so he has 48 cupcakes in total. He needs 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more he needs to buy, we subtract the cupcakes he already has from the total he needs:

\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. The answer is 15."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Joe starts with twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. 20% of 40 is 8 cars, so he sells 8 cars.

Then, he gives away twice as many cars as he sold. So he gives away 2 times 8, which is 16 cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.
After giving away 16 cars, he has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.

So, Joe ends up with 16 cars. The answer is 16."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The charity got a total of $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from other places. So, the students raised the rest, which is $125,000. There are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide $125,000 by 20. 

\[ 125,000 \div 20 = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. 

The answer is: **$6,250**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as long, which is 4 hours. So, if we add the hours from both days, we get:

8 hours + 4 hours = 12 hours

Now, we need to change those hours into minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

12 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 720 minutes

So, Sandy walked for a total of 720 minutes over the two days. The answer is 720 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Hunter first saw 50 cars in the parking lot. Then, 20 more cars came, so he saw 50 + 20 = 70 cars. But during lunch, half of these cars left, so 70 / 2 = 35 cars stayed. So, the number of cars Hunter saw during lunch is 35.

The answer is 35 cars."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easier to understand.

John does 30 cycles of work each day. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays him $1.20. So, in one day, he does 30 cycles times 5 tasks per cycle, which is 150 tasks. For those 150 tasks, he gets 150 times $1.20, which is $180 for the whole day.

Now, if he works like this for 7 days, we just multiply the $180 he makes in one day by 7. So, $180 times 7 is $1260.

So, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week. The answer is $1260."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

In the first game, Sasha played at home and scored 14 points. Julie, being Sasha's best friend, scored 4 points less than Sasha, so Julie scored 10 points.

In the second game, Julie played at her home court and scored 10 points. Sasha, not being so good at away games, scored 6 points less than Julie did in the second game. So, Sasha scored 4 points in the second game.

Now, to find out how many points Sasha scored in total, we add the points from both games: 14 points from the first game plus 4 points from the second game. That makes 18 points in total.

So, Sasha scored 18 points in total. The answer is 18."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package has 11 tins. So, she got:
\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins of cat food} \]

She also bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package has 6 tins. So, she got:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins of dog food} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food she got than dog food, we subtract the tins of dog food from the tins of cat food:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

So, Kimberly got 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The answer is 52."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have three friends: Becca, Smendrick, and PJ. They have 341 magic cards in total. Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ, and Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.

First, let's say PJ has 47 cards. Then Smendrick would have 3 times that, which is 141 cards. Becca would have 12 more than Smendrick, so that's 153 cards.

Now, let's check if the total is 341 cards:
- PJ: 47 cards
- Smendrick: 141 cards
- Becca: 153 cards

Adding them up: 47 + 141 + 153 = 341 cards.

So, Becca has 153 cards. The answer is 153."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Cindy went to the park and got some eggs. She got 5 green ones. Then she got twice as many blue ones as green ones, so that's 10 blue eggs. She got one less pink egg than blue eggs, so that's 9 pink eggs. And she got one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's 3 yellow eggs.

Now, to find out how many eggs she got in total, we add them all up: 5 green + 10 blue + 9 pink + 3 yellow. That makes 27 eggs in total.

So, Cindy got 27 eggs altogether."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Milly bought a book that cost her $32. She has to send it back to the store, which is 20 miles away. The store charges $0.35 for each pound of the book and $0.08 for each mile it travels.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to send the book back. The book weighs 4 pounds, so:
- The cost for the weight is 4 pounds times $0.35 per pound, which is $1.40.
- The cost for the distance is 20 miles times $0.08 per mile, which is $1.60.
- So, the total cost to send the book back is $1.40 plus $1.60, which is $3.00.

Now, the store will give her back 75% of the book's price. So, 75% of $32 is:
- 75% of $32 is 0.75 times $32, which is $24.

Milly has to pay $3.00 to send the book back and only gets $24 back. So, the money she loses is $3.00 minus $24, which is $21.00.

So, Milly loses $21.00. If we have to choose from the options, the closest answer would be $21.00.

The final answer is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mulan starts with $40. Her daddy gives her $100, so she has $140 in total. Then she buys two pairs of jeans that cost $30 each, so that's $60. She also buys a bag for $20. So, she spends $60 + $20 = $80 in total.

Now, if she had $140 and spent $80, she would have $140 - $80 = $60 left. So, the answer is $60."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Boris makes 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. He makes 8,000 bars in the first week. In the second week, he makes half of what he made in the first week, so that's 4,000 bars. In the third week, he makes three times what he made in the first week, so that's 24,000 bars.

Now, to find out how many he makes in the fourth week, we need to see how many he made in the first three weeks and then subtract that from the total he makes in a month.

So, in the first three weeks, he makes:
- First week: 8,000 bars
- Second week: 4,000 bars
- Third week: 24,000 bars

Total for the first three weeks: 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

He makes 50,000 bars in a month, so in the fourth week, he makes:
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars

So, Boris makes 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Britany makes 18 TikTok videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, she spends 18 times 4 minutes on TikTok videos, which is 72 minutes. She also spends 2 hours a week writing songs, which is 120 minutes. And she spends 15 minutes six days a week on makeup, which is 90 minutes. If we add all these up, she spends 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes a week on TikTok stuff. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply 282 minutes by 4, which gives us 1128 minutes. To convert this to hours, we divide 1128 by 60, and we get 18.8 hours. So, Britany spends 18.8 hours on TikTok in a month. The answer is 18.8 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The firm charges $129.00 to install things like mirrors, shelves, a chandelier, and pictures. They also charge an extra $15.00 for each new item you want them to put up.

Angela wants to put up 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. The regular stuff they do is already included in the $129.00, so we just need to add the extra cost for the new stuff.

For the mirrors, they need to put up 6 - 4 = 2 more mirrors, and that costs 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.

For the chandeliers, they need to put up 2 - 1 = 1 more chandelier, and that costs 1 * $15.00 = $15.00.

For the pictures, they need to put up 20 - 10 = 10 more pictures, and that costs 10 * $15.00 = $150.00.

Now, we add all these extra costs together: $30.00 + $15.00 + $150.00 = $195.00.

So, we add this to the regular $129.00, and we get $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00.

So, Angela will pay $324.00."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have Eva who saved $20.00. Anthony saved $10.00 more than Eva, so he saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00. Roy saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much 40% of Anthony's savings is, we do $30.00 * 0.40 = $12.00. So, Roy saved $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00. Therefore, Roy saved $42.00."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a mountain that Pompei can lift 1 inch high. Now, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so that's 12 inches high. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so that's 48 inches high. And Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so that's 480 inches high.

Now, we need to know how many feet 480 inches is. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide 480 by 12. 

480 divided by 12 is 40.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high. 

The answer is: **40**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mason rides his bike at a speed of 8 miles every hour. He rides for 4 hours and then rides for another 6 hours. 

First, for the 4 hours, he travels:
\[ 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 32 \text{ miles} \]

Then, for the next 6 hours, he travels:
\[ 8 \text{ miles/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance he travels is:
\[ 32 \text{ miles} + 48 \text{ miles} = 80 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can figure out how fast they are going. If we add up all their speeds, it equals the speed of 3 kangaroos. So, if we divide the total time by the number of kangaroos, we get how long it takes one kangaroo to cross the highway. That would be 18 hours divided by 3, which is 6 hours for one kangaroo.

Now, if we have 4 turtles, and each turtle is only half as fast as a kangaroo, it means it would take the turtles twice as long to cross the highway as it takes one kangaroo. So, if one kangaroo takes 6 hours, the 4 turtles would take 6 hours times 2, which is 12 hours.

But the question asks how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the highway. Since each turtle is only half as fast, we need to double the time it takes one kangaroo to cross the highway. So, the 4 turtles will take 12 hours to cross the highway.

The answer is: 12 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Kora made 20 clay dishes. Rory made 20 more than Kora, so Rory made 40 dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, so Jada made 80 dishes.

Now, to find out how many they all made together, we add them up: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140 dishes.

So, they made 140 clay dishes in total."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Erika wants a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price goes down to $400. She needs $50 more to buy the new one.

She got $150 from her job and her mom gave her $80. So, she has $150 + $80 = $230 from these.

Now, to get the $400 she needs, she must have $400 - $230 = $170 more.

Since she already has $230 from her job and her mom, and she needs $170 more, that means she must have $170 in her purse.

So, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is $170."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Adam starts with 3 big apples and 5 small apples. Each big apple can be cut into 5 pieces, so 3 big apples give him 3 times 5, which is 15 pieces. Each small apple can be cut into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples give him 5 times 3, which is 15 pieces too. So in total, he gets 15 pieces from the big apples and 15 pieces from the small apples, making 30 pieces in total.

Then Adam eats 15 pieces. To find out how many pieces are left, we take the total pieces he got and subtract the pieces he ate: 30 pieces minus 15 pieces equals 15 pieces left.

So, the number of apple slices left is 15."
"To figure out how many more cows the farmer needs, we start by seeing how much milk the 3 cows are producing. Each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day, so 3 cows give:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer wants to have 25 liters of milk a day. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current amount from the desired amount:
\[ 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Now, we need to know how many cows are needed to produce 10 liters of milk a day. Since each cow gives 5 liters a day, we divide the needed milk by the milk each cow gives:
\[ 10 \div 5 = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to have 25 liters of milk a day. The answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easier to understand.

Patrick has three glue sticks that are not full. One has 1/6 left, the second has 2/3 left, and the third one has 1/2 left. Each glue stick is 12 millimeters long.

First, we find out how much of each glue stick is left:
- For the first glue stick, 1/6 is left, so 5/6 is used. That means 10 millimeters are left.
- For the second glue stick, 2/3 is left, so 1/3 is used. That means 4 millimeters are left.
- For the third glue stick, 1/2 is left, so 1/2 is used. That means 6 millimeters are left.

Now, we add up all the leftover parts:
- 10 millimeters from the first glue stick
- 4 millimeters from the second glue stick
- 6 millimeters from the third glue stick

So, we add them together: 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 millimeters.

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters."
"Gabriel wants to buy a car that costs $10000 and a phone that costs $800. He already has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. So, let's see how much he has in total:

- From working: $5000
- From his brother: $200

Total money he has: $5000 + $200 = $5200

Now, the total cost of the car and the phone is:
- Car: $10000
- Phone: $800

Total cost: $10000 + $800 = $10800

To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the total money he has from the total cost:
- Total cost: $10800
- Money he has: $5200

So, the money he still needs is: $10800 - $5200 = $5600

Therefore, the answer is $5600."

"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, so he has 40 dollars.

He buys 6 squirt guns at 2 dollars each, so that's 12 dollars.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons at 3 dollars each, so that's 9 dollars.

Now, he spends 12 dollars on squirt guns and 9 dollars on water balloons, which is 21 dollars in total.

So, from his 40 dollars, he spends 21 dollars, leaving him with 19 dollars.

So, Craig has 19 dollars left."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without all the big words.

Jack has 60 dishes. He has twice as many socks as dishes, so he has 30 socks. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 60 socks. Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack, so he has 30 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, so that's 90 items.
- Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes, so that's 90 items too.

Together, they have 90 + 90 = 180 items.

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 20 students in total. Out of these, 5 students are only good at math and 8 students are only good at English. That means we have 5 + 8 = 13 students accounted for. So, the rest of the students, which is 20 - 13 = 7 students, are good at both math and English.

Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are only good at math to those who are good at both math and English. So, 5 (only good at math) + 7 (both math and English) = 12 students are good at math.

So, the answer is 12 students are good at math."
"Okay, let's break it down simply. The concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. There's a 10-minute break in the middle, so that leaves us with 110 minutes for the groups to perform.

Each group needs 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to leave. That's a total of 10 minutes per group.

Now, we have 110 minutes to use, and each group takes 10 minutes. So, we can fit 11 groups in the time left after the break.

So, the number of groups that can perform is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Brenda put $300 into a scheme that gives her extra money over time. The extra money is 75 cents for every dollar she puts in, and she does this for 3 years.

First, we need to find out how much extra money she gets in 3 years. She gets 75 cents for every dollar, so for $300, she gets:
\[ 300 \times 0.75 = 225 \text{ dollars} \]

This extra money is the interest. Now, we add this interest to the original $300 she put in:
\[ 300 + 225 = 525 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after 3 years, Brenda will have $525. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{525} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We have 40 white shirts and half of them have collars, so 20 have collars and 20 don't. For the floral shirts, 20 have buttons and the rest don't. So, 30 floral shirts don't have buttons. Now, we want to know how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars. We have 30 floral shirts without buttons and 20 white shirts without collars. So, 30 minus 20 is 10. 

So, the answer is 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The farmer has 900 eggs and each tray can hold 30 eggs. So, to find out how many trays he needs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ 900 \div 30 = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Now, if he sells each tray for $2.5, we need to find out how much he will earn by selling all 30 trays. We do this by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \times 2.5 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the farmer will earn $75. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{75}

"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mr. Smith has two farms. On Farm X, he has 55 goats. On Farm Y, he has 45 goats. He sells 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many from Farm Y. How many goats are left in total?

First, let's see how many goats he sold from each farm:
- From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.
- From Farm Y, he sold 2 times 10, which is 20 goats.

Now, let's find out how many goats are left on each farm:
- On Farm X, he had 55 goats and sold 10, so he has 55 - 10 = 45 goats left.
- On Farm Y, he had 45 goats and sold 20, so he has 45 - 20 = 25 goats left.

Now, let's add the goats left on both farms:
- 45 goats from Farm X + 25 goats from Farm Y = 70 goats in total.

So, the total number of goats left is 70."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month. In a year, which has 12 months, he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes in a year. To find out how much he pays on average for each pair, we divide the total amount by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes. The answer is $110."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We have two types of food baskets: green and red. A green basket costs $25, and a red basket costs $18. If we buy 3 of each, we get a discount of $2 off each red basket.

First, we calculate the cost of 3 green baskets:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 3 red baskets with the discount:
- Each red basket costs $18, but with a $2 discount, it's $16.
- So, for 3 red baskets, it's:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the green and red baskets together:
\[ 75 + 48 = 123 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount we have to pay is $123."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have 90 rooms at the motel, and we need to clean half of them, which is 45 rooms. It takes 20 minutes to clean one room. So, to clean 45 rooms, it would take \(45 \times 20 = 900\) minutes. Now, we need to convert minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so \(900 \div 60 = 15\) hours. So, it would take 15 hours to clean half of the rooms. The answer is 15 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The town is building homes over three years.

- In the first year, they build 12 homes.
- In the second year, they build three times 12, which is 36 homes.
- In the third year, they count all the homes they've built so far (12 from the first year and 36 from the second year, which is 48 homes) and then double that number, so they build 96 homes.

Now, to find out how many homes they've built in total, we add up all the homes:
12 (first year) + 36 (second year) + 96 (third year) = 144 homes.

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years. The answer is 144."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a brother, a sister, and a younger person (me). The brother is 16 years old. The sister is 1 year younger than the brother, so she's 15 years old. I am 3 years younger than the brother, so I'm 13 years old. The mom's age is calculated as three times the brother's age minus one, which is 47 years old. When we add all their ages together, 16 (brother) + 15 (sister) + 13 (me) + 47 (mom) equals 87, which matches the problem statement.

So, I am 13 years old. The answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mr. Jackson has 27 students, and he wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. So, he needs 27 times 2, which is 54 glue sticks in total.

Now, these glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide 54 by 8. 

54 divided by 8 is 6.75. But since he can't buy a fraction of a pack and he wants to have some extra, he needs to round up to the next whole number. So, he needs to buy 7 packs.

So, the answer is 7 packs."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

At first, the river had 4000 gallons of water. After a day of heavy rain, the water doubled, so it became 8000 gallons. Then, on the third day, the water increased by 6000 gallons. So, we add 6000 to 8000, which gives us 14000 gallons.

So, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is 14000 gallons."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We start with 10 people infected. Each day, every infected person infects 6 others. So, on the first day, 10 people infect 6 each, which is 60 new infections. Now we have 10 original infected people plus 60 new ones, making a total of 70 infected people.

On the second day, these 70 people each infect 6 others. That's 70 times 6, which is 420 new infections. So now we have 70 from the first day plus 420 new ones, making a total of 490 infected people.

On the third day, these 490 people each infect 6 others. That's 490 times 6, which is 2940 new infections. So now we have 490 from the second day plus 2940 new ones, making a total of 3430 infected people.

So, after three days, 3430 people are infected."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. At the restaurant, 40 customers each gave Rafaela a $20 tip. So, Rafaela got 40 times 20, which is 800 dollars in tips.

Julieta got 10% less than what Rafaela got. To find out how much less, we take 10% of 800, which is 80 dollars. So, Julieta got 800 minus 80, which is 720 dollars in tips.

Now, to find out how much money they both got together, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips. That's 800 plus 720, which equals 1520 dollars.

So, the total amount of money they both got as tips is 1520 dollars."
"Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so that's 2 times 3, which is 6 oranges. Then she gave her son 3 more oranges. So in total, she gave away 6 plus 3, which is 9 oranges. If she started with 12 oranges and gave away 9, she must have 3 oranges left. So the answer is 3 oranges."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Claire makes a badge every month. So in a year, which has 12 months, she makes 12 badges.

Amber takes twice as long to make a badge as Claire. So if Claire takes 1 month, Amber takes 2 months. In a year, Amber makes 12 months / 2 = 6 badges.

Wendy makes three times as many badges as Claire in the same time. So if Claire makes 12 badges, Wendy makes 12 badges * 3 = 36 badges.

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy makes than Amber, we take Wendy's badges and subtract Amber's badges: 36 - 6 = 30.

So, Wendy makes 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The answer is 30."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Paige bakes banana bread from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. That's 5 hours. In one hour, she can bake 2 loaves. So, in 5 hours, she can bake 10 loaves. Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so she gets 80 slices in total. Each slice is sold for 50 cents, which is the same as $0.50. So, if she sells all 80 slices, she makes $40. 

So, the amount she raised is $40."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Gretchen has 70 gold coins and 40 silver coins. We know that for every gold coin, there are 30 less silver coins. So, if she has 70 gold coins, she must have 40 silver coins because 70 minus 30 equals 40.

Now, to find out how many coins she has in total, we add the gold coins and the silver coins together. So, 70 gold coins plus 40 silver coins equals 110 coins in total.

So, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."

George ordered 600 burritos for the picnic. There were 50 students, and each student got 10 burritos. So, 50 students times 10 burritos each equals 500 burritos given to the students.

Mr. George ate 20 burritos by himself.

Now, we take the total burritos ordered (600) and subtract the burritos given to the students (500) and the burritos Mr. George ate (20). 

So, 600 minus 500 minus 20 equals 80 leftover burritos.

The answer is 80 leftover burritos."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a bumper car rink. They have 12 red cars. Now, they have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so that means they have 10 green cars. And they have 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, so that means they have 30 blue cars.

Now, if we add up all the red, green, and blue cars, we get:
12 (red) + 10 (green) + 30 (blue) = 52 cars.

The rink has 75 cars in total. So, to find out how many yellow cars there are, we take the total number of cars and subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars:
75 - 52 = 23.

So, there are 23 yellow cars. The answer is 23."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have three friends: Sofie, Anne, and Fawn. They have 85 books in total. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, and Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.

First, let's think about Anne. If we say Anne has 16 books, then Fawn would have 16 + 12 = 28 books. Now, if Anne has 16 books, then Sofie would have 16 + 25 = 41 books.

Now, let's add up all the books:
Anne's books + Fawn's books + Sofie's books = 16 + 28 + 41 = 85 books.

So, Fawn has 28 books. The answer is 28."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Daisy bought potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. The sweet potatoes she bought were twice as heavy as the potatoes, so that's 10 pounds. Now, the carrots she bought were 3 pounds lighter than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weighed 7 pounds. So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Greg wants to make jello for 30 kids, and each kid should have 4 jello cups. So, he needs 30 kids times 4 jello cups, which is 120 jello cups in total.

Now, we know that one box of jello makes 10 jello cups. To get 120 jello cups, he needs 120 jello cups divided by 10 jello cups per box, which is 12 boxes.

Each box of jello costs $1.25. So, for 12 boxes, he needs 12 boxes times $1.25 per box, which is $15.

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello. The answer is $15."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The seller bought 5 phones, and each phone cost $700. So, the total cost for 5 phones is $3500. The seller got $4000 from the customer. To find out how much change the seller should give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the money received. 

So, $4000 minus $3500 equals $500. 

The seller will give back $500 in change. 

So, the answer is: **$500**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 a month on groceries. Madeline pays 60% of that, so she pays:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

That means Keenan pays the rest, which is:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, since there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide what Keenan pays by 4 to find out how much he pays each week:

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Keenan spends $40 each week on groceries. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tobias had a big pizza with 60 pieces. He ate 2/5 of the pieces on the first day. So, he ate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces} \]

After the first day, he had:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces left} \]

On the second day, he ate 10 pieces. So, after the second day, he had:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces left} \]

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. So, he ate:

\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, to find out how many pieces he ate in total, we add up what he ate each day:

\[ 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tobias ate 48 pieces of pizza in total. The answer is 48."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

First, we need to find out how much one bottle of soda costs. Seven bottles cost $21.00, so we divide $21.00 by 7 to get how much one bottle costs. That gives us $3.00 for one bottle of soda.

Next, we find out how much one bottle of water costs. Four bottles cost $8.00, so we divide $8.00 by 4 to get how much one bottle costs. That gives us $2.00 for one bottle of water.

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda. So, 3 bottles at $3.00 each is $9.00.

He also wants to buy 2 bottles of water. So, 2 bottles at $2.00 each is $4.00.

If we add the cost of the soda and the water together, $9.00 + $4.00, we get $13.00.

So, David will spend $13.00 in total."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. David has $12.48 and he wants to buy 16 bolts. Each bolt costs a little bit, just 3 cents. So, 16 times 3 cents is 48 cents, which is the same as $0.48.

Now, if David spends $0.48 on the bolts, how much money does he have left? That's right, $12.48 minus $0.48 is $12.00.

So, the money David has left after buying the bolts is $12.00."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ella made $33 for walking 3 dogs. To find out how much she makes per hour, I divide $33 by 3 hours, which gives me $11 per hour. That's how much she makes for each dog she walks.

Now, if she keeps walking dogs at this rate, I need to know how much she'll make for 12 hours. To find that, I multiply $11 by 12, which gives me $132.

So, if Ella walks dogs for 12 hours, she would earn $132. The answer is $132."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Paul starts with 52 marbles. Then his friend gives him 28 more, so he has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles. Now, he loses 1/4 of his marbles, which is 1/4 of 80, so he loses 20 marbles. That means he has 80 - 20 = 60 marbles left.

So, the number of marbles Paul has left is 60."
"Okay, let me break it down simply. Amy answered 80% of the multiple-choice questions right, and there were 10 of those. So, she got 80% of 10, which is 8 questions right. Each of those is worth 1 point, so that's 8 points.

For the true/false questions, she got 90% right, and there were 20 of those. So, she got 90% of 20, which is 18 questions right. Each of those is worth 1 point, so that's 18 points.

For the long-answer questions, she got 60% right, and there were 5 of those. So, she got 60% of 5, which is 3 questions right. Each of those is worth 5 points, so that's 3 times 5, which is 15 points.

Now, if we add all these points together: 8 points from multiple-choice, 18 points from true/false, and 15 points from long-answer, we get 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 points.

So, Amy scores 41 points."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Isaias has 300 chickens and he plans to sell 3/5 of them. So, he plans to sell 180 chickens. He sells each chicken for $50. So, if he sells 180 chickens at $50 each, he gets 180 * 50 = $9000.

He wants to make a profit of $2000, so to find out how much he bought the chickens for, we take the total money he got from selling the chickens and subtract the profit. So, $9000 - $2000 = $7000.

Therefore, Isaias bought the chickens for $7000. The answer is $7000."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold 32 glasses of lemonade in total. Julie sold 14 glasses. So, Micah and Mitchell together sold the rest, which is 32 - 14 = 18 glasses. Since they sold an equal number of glasses, Micah sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses. 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold: 14 - 9 = 5.

So, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The answer is 5."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. At the spa, Iris spent $400 on her hair. For the manicure, she spent a quarter of that, which is $400 divided by 4, so that's $100. For the pedicure, she spent three quarters of what she spent on the manicure, which is $100 times 3/4, so that's $75.

Now, to find out how much she spent in total, we add up all these amounts: $400 for the hair, $100 for the manicure, and $75 for the pedicure. So, $400 + $100 + $75 equals $575.

Therefore, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long and it costs $2 for each meter. So, if she sells the rope, she'll get 20 meters * $2/meter = $40.

Now, she wants to use this $40 to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 for each meter. She can buy 26 meters of the new rope because 26 * $1.5/meter = $39, and that's less than $40.

So, after buying the new rope, she'll have $40 - $39 = $1 left over.

The answer is: $1"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years. So, Melanie is currently 8 years old (18 - 10 = 8).

Now, we want to know when Melanie's age will be three times her current age. Her current age is 8, so three times her current age is 24 (3 × 8 = 24).

If Melanie is 8 now, we need to find out how many years from now she will be 24. We can do this by subtracting her current age from 24: 24 - 8 = 16.

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The answer is 16 years."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Kelly has some items in her cart. She has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total. Each pack of bacon costs $2 because $10 divided by 5 is $2.

She also has 6 packs of chicken. Each pack of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, so each chicken pack costs $4. So, 6 packs of chicken cost $4 times 6, which is $24.

She has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4. So, 3 packs cost $4 times 3, which is $12.

She has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries. Since a pack of strawberries costs $4, a pack of apples costs $4 divided by 2, which is $2. So, 7 packs of apples cost $2 times 7, which is $14.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Bacon: $10
- Chicken: $24
- Strawberries: $12
- Apples: $14

Total cost is $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60.

Kelly's budget is $65. So, if she spends $60, she has $65 - $60 = $5 left.

So, the money left in her budget is $5."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Elaina's final concert was twice as long as her usual concerts plus an extra 15 minutes for the encore. We know the total time for the final concert was 65 minutes. So, if we take away the 15 minutes for the encore, we get 50 minutes. That 50 minutes is twice the usual length of her concerts. So, to find out how long her usual concerts are, we divide 50 by 2, which gives us 25 minutes.

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes."
"Argo started with 200 toys. He gave some away to friends. He gave 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find out how many toys he has left, we need to add up the toys he gave away and subtract that from the toys he started with.

He gave away 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys in total.

So, the number of toys he has left is 200 - 150 = 50 toys.

The final answer is 50 toys."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

They make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Friday, they make twice as many as Tuesday, so that's 250 chimichangas.

So, if we add them all up:
- Tuesday: 125
- Wednesday: 125
- Friday: 250

125 + 125 + 250 = 500

So, they make 500 chimichangas in total on those three days. The answer is 500."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The singer has 50 microphones and 20% of them can't be paired. So, we first find out how many microphones can't be paired. That's 20% of 50, which is 10 microphones. So, we take away those 10 from the total, leaving us with 40 microphones that can be paired. Now, to pair them up, we divide 40 by 2, which gives us 20 pairs. So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage. The answer is 20 pairs."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes. Now, he sees 2/3 of that number flying around, which is 4 birds. And he also sees 3 groups of 8 birds each, which makes 24 birds. So, if we add all these up, we get 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 birds in total. So, Jerry counts 34 birds."
"Lani made 55 cookies and ate 5 of them, so she had 50 cookies left. She put these 50 cookies into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies went into each jar, she would divide the 50 cookies by 5 jars. So, 50 divided by 5 is 10. Therefore, there were 10 cookies in each jar. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Joelle has 5 orchids and 4 African daisies. Each orchid has 5 petals, so 5 orchids will have 5 times 5 petals, which is 25 petals. Each daisy has 10 petals, so 4 daisies will have 4 times 10 petals, which is 40 petals. Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have, we subtract the petals of the orchids from the petals of the daisies. So, 40 petals (from daisies) minus 25 petals (from orchids) equals 15 petals. Therefore, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The answer is 15."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in her garden. One-fourth of them are indoor plants, so that's 25 plants. That leaves 75 plants.

Out of those 75 plants, two-thirds are outdoor plants. So, we calculate two-thirds of 75, which is 50 plants.

That means the rest, which are 75 - 50 = 25 plants, are flowering plants.

To find out what percentage of the total plants are flowering, we take the number of flowering plants (25) and divide it by the total number of plants (100), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. So, 25/100 * 100 = 25%.

So, 25% of the plants are flowering plants. The answer is 25%."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a whatchamacallit that spins really fast, 121 meters per second. It spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So, to find out how fast a thingamabob spins, we divide 121 by 11. That gives us 11 meters per second.

Now, a whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob. So, we take the speed of the thingamabob (11 meters per second) and multiply it by 5. That gives us 55 meters per second.

So, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second. The answer is 55."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half of that, so it's $3. If we add up all these, it costs her $11 in total.

Now, we know the salad and yogurt together cost $6 + $3 = $9. So, the rest of the $11 must be for the carrots. That means the two carrots cost $11 - $9 = $2. Since she eats two carrots, one carrot must cost $2 / 2 = $1.

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Mark used to make $10 an hour, but they gave him a raise to $12 an hour. He works 8 hours a day and does this for 5 days in a week. So, he works 8 times 5, which is 40 hours a week. At $12 an hour, for 40 hours, he makes 12 times 40, which is 480 dollars. So, Mark makes 480 dollars a week. The answer is 480."
"Oh, hello there! Let me see if I can help you out with this. So, Tasha made $80 last month from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. Now, she mowed Joe's lawn once and got $6 for that. The next week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's, so that's five times $6, which is $30. So, the total she made from mowing lawns is $6 plus $30, which is $36. If she made $80 total, then the rest must have been from selling lemonade. So, $80 minus $36 gives us $44. 

So, Tasha made $44 from selling lemonade. 

The answer is: **$44**"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Martin weighs 55 kg. Carl is 16 kg heavier than Martin, so Carl weighs 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg. Christian is 8 kg heavier than Carl, so Christian weighs 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg. Harry is 5 kg lighter than Christian, so Harry weighs 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg. Therefore, Harry weighs 74 kg. The answer is 74 kg."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. John rents his car out 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours. He gets $25 for each hour. So, in a month, he gets:

\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

And for those 30 hours, he makes:

\[ 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

But he has to pay $500 for his car every month. So, the money he makes after paying his car payment is:

\[ 750 - 500 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John makes a profit of 250 dollars a month. The answer is 250."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Martha originally had some notebooks, and Joseph had three times as many. So if Martha had 2 notebooks, Joseph had 6 notebooks.

Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, so she ended up with 7 notebooks in total.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Joseph still has 6 notebooks, and Martha has 7.

So, Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The answer is:

1"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

On Sunday, Dijana went rowing and covered 50 miles. Anis rowed a bit more than Dijana. He rowed 1/5 more than Dijana, which means he rowed 10 more miles than Dijana because 1/5 of 50 is 10. So, Anis rowed 50 + 10 = 60 miles.

Now, to find out how far they both rowed together, we add Dijana's and Anis's distances: 50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles.

So, the total distance they rowed on that day is 110 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Susan made 100 cookies for her nephews. She wanted to give each nephew the same number of cookies. But before she could give them, her husband took 4 cookies for himself. So, she had 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.

Now, she wants to share these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew gets, we divide 96 by 6.

96 ÷ 6 = 16

So, each nephew gets 16 cookies. The answer is 16."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Denise and Daniel were reading the same book. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel did yesterday, so she read 10 + 5 = 15 pages. Daniel didn't read any pages today.

So, Denise read a total of 10 pages yesterday plus 15 pages today, which is 25 pages. Daniel read 13 pages in total.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the number of pages Daniel read from the number Denise read: 25 pages (Denise) - 13 pages (Daniel) = 12 pages.

So, Denise read 12 more pages than Daniel. The answer is 12."
"Oh, hello there! Let me try to figure this out for you. So, Calvin has a pot of soup that can fill either four adult bowls or eight child's bowls. He's an adult, and he's having dinner with his wife and two kids. That makes four people in total.

Now, the pot can fill four adult bowls, which is the same as eight child's bowls. If everyone eats one bowl, that means Calvin, his wife, and the two kids will all eat one bowl each. That's four bowls in total.

Since the pot can fill four adult bowls, and they only need four bowls for the family, there won't be any soup left over. So, none of the kids can have a bowl of soup again for lunch.

The answer is: **0 times**."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

William bought 5 notebooks, and each notebook costs $1.50. So, for the notebooks, he spent:
\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

He also bought 1 ballpen, and each ballpen costs $0.50. So, for the ballpen, he spent:
\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Now, to find out how much he spent in all, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, William spent $8.00 in total. The answer is $8.00."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material, so that means she needs 0.5 yards for each small mask. For 20 small masks, she would need 20 times 0.5 yards, which is 10 yards.

For the large masks, she can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material, so each large mask needs 0.75 yards. For 8 large masks, she would need 8 times 0.75 yards, which is 6 yards.

So, for 20 small masks and 8 large masks, she would need 10 yards for the small ones and 6 yards for the large ones. Adding these up, she needs 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material.

So, the answer is 16 yards."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Deepa saw each of the 9 movies 3 times, so she saw a total of 9 times 3, which is 27 times. That means she bought 27 movie tickets.

She spent $216 on all these tickets. To find out how much she paid for each ticket, we need to divide the total money by the number of tickets. So, we do $216 divided by 27.

$216 divided by 27 is 8.

So, the average price she paid per ticket is $8.

The answer is: $8"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so that's 10 hours minus 2 hours, which is 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

So, in one day, he spends:
- 10 hours sleeping
- 8 hours working
- 1 hour walking the dog

That's a total of 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day, so to find out how much free time he has, we take the total hours in a day and subtract the hours he spends on his activities:
24 - 19 = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Tim starts with 7 blue boxes and 9 red boxes. He uses 3 blue boxes, so he has 4 blue boxes left. He also uses 1/3 of his red boxes, which is 3 red boxes, so he has 6 red boxes left. Now, if we add the blue and red boxes he has left, we get 4 blue + 6 red = 10 boxes in total. So, the answer is 10 boxes."
"Sarah starts with 9 books. Joseph had twice as many books as Sarah, so he had 18 books. But he lost 2 books. So, Joseph now has 16 books. The answer is 16."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives away some to Jamie and 10 to Donald. First, he gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie. So, 1/5 of 30 is 6 marbles. That means he gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

After giving 6 marbles to Jamie, he has 30 - 6 = 24 marbles left. Then he gives 10 more marbles to Donald. So, he gives away 10 more marbles.

Now, he has 24 - 10 = 14 marbles left.

So, the number of marbles Dean has left is 14."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Duncan is 60 years old now. Eight years ago, Duncan was 52 years old. At that time, Adam's age was half of 52, which is 26 years old. So, four years ago, Adam was 22 years old.

Now, to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age. Since he was 22 when he was 4, that means he is 22 years old now. So, in 8 years, he will be 22 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 years old.

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The answer is 38."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Farmer Brown has a farm that's 200 acres big. Farmer Smith's farm is supposed to be 100 acres more than twice what Farmer Brown has. So, first, we find out what twice 200 is. That's 400 acres. Then we add 100 more acres to that, so Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.

Now, to find out how many acres both farms have together, we add 200 (from Farmer Brown) and 500 (from Farmer Smith). That makes 700 acres in total.

So, the total number of acres for both farms is 700."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he makes. He makes 40 packages an hour because 50 minus 10 is 40. In an 8-hour workday, he makes 40 packages/hour times 8 hours, which equals 320 packages. For each package, he gets $0.20, so for 320 packages, he gets 320 times $0.20, which is $64. So, the total money he earns in a day is $64."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. John drinks a bottle of water every half hour. A normal sudoku takes him 45 minutes, and an extreme one takes 4 times that, so that's 180 minutes. If he drinks one bottle every half hour, we need to see how many half hours are in 180 minutes. There are 30 minutes in a half hour, so we divide 180 by 30. That gives us 6. So, John drinks 6 bottles of water in that time. The answer is 6."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Benny threw 20 red balloons and each red balloon got 2 pieces of bologna. So, for 20 red balloons, he used \(20 \times 2 = 40\) pieces of bologna. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, so the rest must have been for yellow balloons. That means he used \(58 - 40 = 18\) pieces of bologna for yellow balloons. Since each yellow balloon got 3 pieces of bologna, the number of yellow balloons is \(18 \div 3 = 6\). So, Benny had 6 yellow balloons. The answer is 6."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days, so he drives a total of 3000 miles in a month. His car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. So, to find out how many times he needs a tune-up, we divide the total miles by 1000. 

\[ 3000 \div 1000 = 3 \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The answer is 3."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours. On Wednesday, he works twice as much as Tuesday, so that's 10 hours. On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than Wednesday, so that's 8 hours.

Now, if we add all these up: 5 hours on Tuesday + 10 hours on Wednesday + 8 hours on Thursday, we get 23 hours in total.

So, Bruce works 23 hours in all these three days. The answer is 23."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Julia and Nadine had the same amount of money from their mom. They used this money to buy a cake that cost $11, 12 balloons that cost $3, and 2 ice cream tubs that cost $14 each. So, they spent a total of $11 + $3 + $14 = $28.

Since they split the money equally, each of them got half of $28, which is $14.

So, the amount Julia and Nadine's mom gave each of them is $14.

The answer is: **$14**"
"Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. That's a total of 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit. Lola ate 2 pieces, so we take away 2 from the total. That leaves us with 14 - 2 = 12 pieces of fruit. So, the number of pieces left is 12."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 6 students playing tennis. For volleyball, it says there are twice as many students as in tennis, so that's 12 students. Now, we add the tennis and volleyball students together: 6 + 12 = 18 students.

Next, we look at soccer. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so that's 16 + 22 = 38 students.

Now, we add all the students together: 18 (tennis and volleyball) + 38 (soccer) = 56 students.

So, the total number of students is 56."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. There are 30 students, and each sold 10 lollipops. So, they sold a total of 300 lollipops. Each lollipop was sold for 80 cents, so they made $240 from selling all the lollipops. Now, they bought each lollipop for 50 cents, so they spent $150 on buying the lollipops. To find out how much money they made, we subtract the cost from the money they got. So, $240 - $150 = $90. Therefore, the class made $90 from selling the lollipops. The answer is $90."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 times 3, which is 9 dogs. Then he has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 minus 2, which is 7 rabbits. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 times 7, which is 21 fish. Lastly, he has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 divided by 3, which is 7 gerbils.

Now, to find out how many pets he has in total, I'll add them all up: 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils. That makes 47 pets in total.

So, the total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a loaf of bread with 24 slices. Abby can eat 2 slices a day, and Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 4 slices a day. Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.

Now, if we have 24 slices and they eat 6 slices a day, we can figure out how many days the bread will last by dividing the total slices by the slices they eat together in a day. So, 24 slices divided by 6 slices a day equals 4 days.

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days. The answer is 4 days."
"Oh, okay. So Martha starts collecting shells when she's 5 years old and she keeps it up every month until she's 10 years old. That means she's collecting for 5 years. If we count the months, that's 5 times 12, which is 60 months. So, by the time she's 10, she'll have collected 60 shells. So the answer is 60 shells."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Lana has 27 cups of tea to brew. She uses 15 of them for cinnamon tea, so she has 12 cups left for chamomile and mint tea. She splits these 12 cups equally between chamomile and mint tea, so she makes 6 cups of each.

Now, she divides these 27 cups into 3 rows. So, each row gets 27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups. Since she splits the 6 cups of chamomile and mint tea equally, each row gets 6 cups / 3 rows = 2 cups of chamomile and 2 cups of mint tea. But we need to find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row, and that's 2 cups.

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 2. The answer is:

2"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The sloth takes 4 hours to go down to pick berries and then go back up. In 8 hours, he can do that twice. So, if he wants to pick 24 berries in 8 hours, he needs to pick the same number of berries each time he goes down. 

If he goes down twice in 8 hours and picks 24 berries in total, then he must have picked 12 berries each time he went down. So, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 12. 

The answer is: **12 berries per trip**."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We start with a big pool that has 10000 gallons of water. Anthony and his dad fill a smaller tank with half of that, so the tank gets 5000 gallons of water.

Now, the tank loses water at a rate of 500 gallons every day. We want to know how much water is left after 6 days. In 6 days, the tank loses 500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons.

So, after 6 days, the tank has 5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons left.

The answer is 2000 gallons."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Colby has $150 to spend on movies. He wants to buy a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) first. So, he spends $10 on these. That leaves him with $140.

Now, he can only see one more movie because it's the last day of the month and it's a Friday. On Fridays and Saturdays, he can see a movie for $10. So, he can see one more movie.

The answer is: 1 movie."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins. Each mini cinnamon roll has 200 calories and each mini blueberry muffin has 150 calories.

First, we calculate the total calories for the cinnamon rolls:
- 200 mini cinnamon rolls × 200 calories each = 40,000 calories

Next, we calculate the total calories for the blueberry muffins:
- 300 mini blueberry muffins × 150 calories each = 45,000 calories

Now, we add these two totals together to get the total calories:
- 40,000 calories + 45,000 calories = 85,000 calories

So, the total calories from all the pastries Andrew baked is 85,000 calories."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Rita picks Junebugs from her plants every summer. She picked some on Monday, and then on Tuesday and Wednesday, she picked twice as many as she did on Monday. On Thursday, she picked 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she picked 57. We need to find out how many Junebugs she picked on average each day.

First, let's see how many she picked on Monday. She picked 39 Junebugs.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, she picked twice as many as Monday, so:
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\)

Now, let's add up all the Junebugs she picked:
- Monday: 39
- Tuesday: 78
- Wednesday: 78
- Thursday: 48
- Friday: 57

So, we add them all together:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Let's do the math:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, she picked 299 Junebugs in total.

Now, to find out how many she picked on average each day, we divide the total by the number of days:
\[299 \div 5 = 59.8\]

So, the average number of Junebugs she picked each day is 59.8. The answer is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without all the big words.

The bus goes 60 miles an hour and it goes for 5 hours. So, the bus travels 60 times 5, which is 300 miles.

The car goes 30 miles an hour and it goes for 8 hours. So, the car travels 30 times 8, which is 240 miles.

Now, to find out how much farther the bus went, we take the bus's distance and subtract the car's distance. So, 300 miles minus 240 miles equals 60 miles.

So, the bus went 60 miles farther than the car. The answer is 60 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Sophie had some toys before she got the bouncy balls. She had 31 building blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 stacking rings. That's 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 toys in total.

Now, Sophie has 62 toys in total. So, to find out how many bouncy balls she got, we take the total number of toys she has now and subtract the number of toys she had before. That means 62 - 48 = 14 bouncy balls.

So, Sophie got 14 bouncy balls in the tube. The answer is 14."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. We have three friends: Peter, Paul, and Jean. Their ages add up to 100 years. Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is the same as the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

First, let's say Jean is 20 years old. Since Paul is 10 years older than Jean, Paul would be 30 years old. Now, Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages, so Peter would be 20 (Jean's age) + 30 (Paul's age) = 50 years old.

So, Peter is 50 years old. The answer is 50."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Maria invited 4 friends over for a water balloon fight. She gave each friend 2 balloons, so that's 4 friends times 2 balloons each, which is 8 balloons. Maria also got 1 balloon. So, before her mom gave more, they had 8 + 1 = 9 balloons.

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so that's 5 people times 3 balloons each, which is 15 balloons.

So, the total number of balloons they had is 9 (before) plus 15 (after her mom gave more), which is 24 balloons. 

So, the answer is 24 balloons."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

They have 10 people who each give 5 boxes, so that's 50 boxes. Then they have 10 more boxes already. So in total, they have 50 + 10 = 60 boxes of stuff.

Now, they can fit 2 boxes on each table. So, to find out how many tables they need, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes that fit on one table. That's 60 boxes ÷ 2 boxes/table = 30 tables.

They already have 15 tables, but they need 30 tables in total. So, they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.

The answer is: 15 new tables."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Zoey and Sydney are having a contest to see who can spit their watermelon seeds the farthest. Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. So, she spits a total of 400 feet. Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet, so she spits a total of 420 feet.

Now, to find out who spits the seeds the farthest on average, we add the total distances they spit and then divide by 2. Zoey spits 400 feet and Sydney spits 420 feet. If we add those together, we get 820 feet. Then we divide 820 by 2 to find the average. So, 820 divided by 2 is 410 feet.

The average total distance they spit is 410 feet. So, the answer is 410 feet."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Fern has two machines to make widgets. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and the WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. Each widget sells for $6.

First, we need to find out how many widgets each machine makes in a day. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and it works 24 hours a day, so it makes:
\[ 60 \times 24 = 1440 \text{ widgets/day} \]

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, and it also works 24 hours a day, so it makes:
\[ 45 \times 24 = 1080 \text{ widgets/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many widgets each machine makes in a month. There are 30 days in a month, so:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes:
\[ 1440 \times 30 = 43200 \text{ widgets/month} \]
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes:
\[ 1080 \times 30 = 32400 \text{ widgets/month} \]

Now, we calculate the money each machine makes by selling the widgets. Each widget sells for $6, so:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes:
\[ 43200 \times 6 = \$259200 \]
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes:
\[ 32400 \times 6 = \$194400 \]

To find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract:
\[ 259200 - 194400 = \$64800 \]

So, Fern makes \$64800 more with the Widgeteer 3000. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{64800}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Cameron wants to stay at the hotel from 5 pm to 10 am the next day. That's a total of 17 hours. The hotel has two options: a 24-hour stay for 1600 pesos or a 12-hour stay for 1000 pesos plus 70 pesos for every hour after the first 12 hours.

If Cameron chooses the 24-hour option, he pays 1600 pesos.

If he chooses the 12-hour plus extra hours option, he pays 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours and then 70 pesos for each of the extra 5 hours. So, that's 1000 + 5 * 70 = 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

To find out how much Cameron saves, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour plus extra hours option from the cost of the 24-hour option:
1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

So, Cameron saves 250 pesos by choosing the 12-hour plus extra hours option. The answer is 250 pesos."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Nate has goats and sheep. Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs. So, a sheep needs \(2 \times 5 - 3 = 7\) pounds of hay.

Now, Nate has 15 goats, so the goats need \(15 \times 5 = 75\) pounds of hay.

He also has 12 sheep, so the sheep need \(12 \times 7 = 84\) pounds of hay.

To find out how much hay Nate needs in total, we add the hay for the goats and the sheep together: \(75 + 84 = 159\) pounds.

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay. The answer is 159."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without all the big words.

John makes 50 dollars an hour and works for 6 hours. So, he makes 300 dollars in total. After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has 250 dollars left. Then he wants to put 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 150 dollars left. Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so that's 50 dollars. After buying the pencils, he has 100 dollars left. With 100 dollars, he can buy 4 pens that cost 25 dollars each.

So, the number of pens he can buy is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Craig spelled out words with 15 letters each. He did this 20 times. So, he spelled out 20 times 15 letters, which is 300 letters.

His brother spelled out words that had 50 more letters than Craig. So, his brother spelled out 300 plus 50, which is 350 letters.

Now, to find out the total number of letters they both spelled out, we add Craig's letters to his brother's letters: 300 plus 350 is 650.

So, the total number of letters they spelled out is 650."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine we have 8 kids in each line. Now, there are 7 lines for each of the 5 schools. So, we need to find out how many kids there are in total.

First, we find out how many lines there are in total. We do this by multiplying the number of lines per school by the number of schools:
\[ 7 \text{ lines/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 35 \text{ lines} \]

Next, we find out how many kids are in all the lines. We do this by multiplying the number of kids in each line by the total number of lines:
\[ 8 \text{ kids/line} \times 35 \text{ lines} = 280 \text{ kids} \]

So, the total number of kids in the drill is 280."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon gives 100 bottles of juice. So, 9 coupons give 900 bottles of juice. There are 29 students, and each gets 2 bottles of juice. So, 29 students getting 2 bottles each is 58 bottles. Now, if the teacher takes away the 58 bottles given to the students from the 900 bottles, she has 842 bottles left for herself. So, the number of bottles the teacher has left is 842."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. Patty's Plumbing charges $40 to visit a house and do the repair. They also charge $35 for every hour they work, and they worked for 2.25 hours. They used $60 worth of parts too.

First, we calculate how much they charged for the hours they worked. They worked for 2.25 hours, and they charge $35 for each hour, so:
\[ 35 \times 2.25 = 78.75 \]

Now, we add the visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged $178.75. The answer is $178.75."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

James got 10 CDs, and each CD cost $15. So, the CDs cost him $150 in total. But he got them at a 40% discount, which means he only paid 60% of the total cost. So, he paid:
\[ 10 \times 15 \times 0.60 = 90 \]
That's $90 for the 10 CDs.

James didn't like 5 of the CDs, so he decided to sell them. Each CD cost him $15, so 5 CDs cost him:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
He sold these 5 CDs for $40.

So, the money he lost is the cost of the 5 CDs he sold minus the money he got from selling them:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \]

Therefore, James was out $35. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Okay, let me break it down simply. Jen has different types of root crops she wants to sell. She has 6 yams, 10 sweet potatoes, and 4 carrots. 

First, she sells the yams. Each yam is sold for $1.5. So, for 6 yams, she gets:
\[ 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \]
So, she earns $9 from the yams.

Next, she sells the sweet potatoes. Each sweet potato is sold for $2. So, for 10 sweet potatoes, she gets:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \]
So, she earns $20 from the sweet potatoes.

Then, she sells the carrots. Each carrot is sold for $1.25. So, for 4 carrots, she gets:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \]
So, she earns $5 from the carrots.

Now, to find out how much she earns in total, we add up all the earnings:
\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \]

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. James has to swim across a 20-mile lake. He swims 60% of the distance, which is 12 miles, at a speed of 2 miles per hour. So, it takes him 6 hours to swim that distance because 12 miles divided by 2 miles per hour equals 6 hours. After that, he rests for half as long as he swam, so he rests for 3 hours. Then he swims the remaining 8 miles at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour. So, it takes him 8 hours to swim the last 8 miles. Adding all these times together, 6 hours for the first part, 3 hours for the rest, and 8 hours for the last part, we get a total of 17 hours. So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. The bakery has seven times that amount, which is 70 times 7, and that's 490. But the bakery only has 40 less than that, so we take 490 and subtract 40, which gives us 450.

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread."
"Oh, okay. So Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. But she loses 7, so she has 8 left. Then her teacher gives her 5 more stickers. So she gets 8 plus 5, which makes 13 stickers. So at the end, Jasmine has 13 stickers."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Cayley sells newspapers and gets money for each one he sells. He gets 10 cents for each New York Times and 8 cents for each Wall Street Journal. He sells 6 New York Times and 10 Wall Street Journal.

First, let's see how much he gets from the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5 and he gets 10 cents for each one.
- So, for 6 New York Times, he gets 6 times 10 cents, which is 60 cents or $0.60.
- He sells 6 of them, so he gets $0.60 * 6 = $3.60 from New York Times.

Now, let's see how much he gets from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15 and he gets 8 cents for each one.
- So, for 10 Wall Street Journal, he gets 10 times 8 cents, which is 80 cents or $0.80.
- He sells 10 of them, so he gets $0.80 * 10 = $8.00 from Wall Street Journal.

Now, to find out the total money he gets, we add the money from New York Times and Wall Street Journal:
- Total money = $3.60 + $8.00 = $11.60.

So, Cayley gets a total of $11.60 from selling those newspapers. The closest answer to $11.60 from the options given would be $11.60 itself, but if the options were $11.50, $11.60, $11.70, and $11.80, then the correct answer would be $11.60.

The correct answer is $11.60."
"Okay, let me explain it like I understand better.

We know Deanna is 26 years old. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 21 years old. Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, Leo must be twice as old as Marcus. So, Leo is 21 times 2, which is 42 years old.

So, Leo is 42 years old."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have three friends, Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar, and they scored a total of 45 points. Bahati scored the most, and he scored 20 more than Azibo, and 10 more than Dinar.

If we say Azibo scored \( A \) points, then Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points, and Dinar scored \( A + 10 \) points. When we add all their points together, it equals 45. So we have:

\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\[ 3A = 15 \]

Then divide by 3:

\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The answer is 5."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We know the book is 1.5 inches thick, and for every inch, there are 100 pages stacked together. Since each page is printed on both sides, we need to count both sides of each page.

So, for 1 inch, we have 100 pages. For 1.5 inches, we would have:
\[ 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Each page is on both sides, so we double the number of pages to get the total number of pages in the book:
\[ 150 \times 2 = 300 \text{ pages} \]

So, the book has 300 pages. The answer is 300 pages."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. He started stapling at 8:00 AM and stopped at 11:00 PM. That's a long time, isn't it? Let's break it down.

From 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM is 3 hours, and from 11:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 13 hours. So, that's 16 hours total.

Now, if we think about how many 15-minute parts are in 16 hours, we can count them. 16 hours is 960 minutes (because 16 * 60 = 960). If 15 minutes is one part, then 960 minutes is 960 / 15 = 64 parts.

Since he can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute part, we multiply the number of parts by 30. So, 64 parts * 30 reports = 1920 reports.

So, Vince stapled 1920 reports in total."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. That's 480 minutes.

One day, she sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. That's 23 minutes.

She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.

Now, she was awake from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is 7 hours and 55 minutes. That's 475 minutes.

She spent 23 minutes sleepwalking and 5 minutes waking up early, which is 28 minutes in total.

So, the time she actually slept is 475 minutes minus 28 minutes, which is 447 minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is 447 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jonathan starts with two dozen measuring cups. Two dozen is like saying 2 times 12, which is 24. So, he has 24 cups.

Now, he has 2/3 as many spoons as cups. So, he has 2/3 of 24 spoons, which is 16 spoons.

But then he gives 6 spoons to Pedro. So, he's left with 16 - 6 = 10 spoons.

Now, he has 24 cups and 10 spoons. So, the total number of utensils he has left is 24 + 10 = 34.

So, the answer is 34."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The hospital has 1000 beds, and at first, 1/5 of them are taken. So, 1/5 of 1000 is 200 beds are taken. That means 800 beds are empty.

Now, every day, 50 more people come into the hospital. In 2 weeks, which is 14 days, 50 people come in each day. So, 50 times 14 equals 700 more people come in.

So, after 2 weeks, the total number of people in the hospital is 200 (already there) plus 700 (new people), which is 900 people.

That means 1000 beds minus 900 beds equals 100 beds are empty.

So, the number of empty beds after 2 weeks is 100."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are for work. That leaves 9 emails for other people. Two-thirds of these 9 emails are for her family, so that's 6 emails. That leaves 3 emails for her boyfriend. One-third of these 3 emails go to her boyfriend, so that's 1 email. So, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend. The answer is 1."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know Aliya is 3 years old. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna is 3 times 3, which is 9 years old. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so that means Shawna's father is 5 times 9, which is 45 years old. So, Shawna's father is 45 years old."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert, but Kelly thinks that's too many. Kelly says Courtney might have added 20% too much. So, if we take 48 and think it's 20% more than the real number, we need to find out what the real number is.

If 48 is 120% of the real number (because 100% is the real number and 20% more is added), we can find the real number by dividing 48 by 1.20.

So, we do 48 divided by 1.20, and we get 40.

Therefore, the real number of people who went to the concert is 40."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. The problem says that Jason carried 2 balls. Since Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, Jeffrey carried half of that, which is 1 ball. And since Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, Jordan carried 4 balls. So, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, Jason carried 2 balls, and Jordan carried 4 balls. If we add them all up, we get 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls. So, the coach brought 7 balls to practice. The answer is 7."
"Oh, hello there! Let me try to figure this out for you. So, the pirates dug some holes over four days. On the first day, they dug 10 holes. On the second day, they dug 13 more holes. On the third day, they dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so it's like they only added 6 holes. So by the end of the third day, they had 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 holes. Now, by the end of the third day, the island had four times as many holes as at the end of the first day. The first day had 10 holes, so four times that is 40 holes. But we know they only had 29 holes by then, so they must have dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day. That's how they found the treasure chest, right? So, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is 11."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips, and Collins got 15 more than that, which is 85 corn chips. So, if we add all these together, we get:

70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"The cost of the supplies is $400. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. So, to find out how much the tickets cost, I add 50% of $400 to $400. 50% of $400 is $200. Adding $200 to $400 gives us $600. So, the travel cost is $600."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easier to understand.

We have three friends: Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe. They caught a total of 339 Pokemon. We know that Alex caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan caught 13 less than four times what Adelwolfe caught.

First, let's say Adelwolfe caught \( A \) Pokemon. Then Stan caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, and Alex caught \( 4A - 13 + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

Now, if we add up all the Pokemon they caught, it should be 339. So we have:

\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Adding 21 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Dividing by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

So Adelwolfe caught 40 Pokemon. Now we can find out how many Stan caught:

\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan caught 147 Pokemon.

The answer is: \(\boxed{147}\)"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. The show has episodes that are each 20 minutes long. There are half as many episodes as there are minutes in each episode. So, if each episode is 20 minutes, then there are 20 / 2 = 10 episodes. Since each episode is 20 minutes and there are 10 episodes, the total time John will spend watching the show is 20 minutes per episode times 10 episodes, which equals 200 minutes. So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show. The answer is 200 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The bird flies for 10 hours in one direction, then 2 hours in another, and finally 5 hours in the last direction. We need to find out how far she flew in each part of her trip.

First, she flies 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. So, she flies:
\[ 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Then, she flies 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. So, she flies:
\[ 2 \times 18 = 36 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, she flies 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. So, she flies:
\[ 5 \times 22 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add all these distances together:
\[ 300 + 36 + 110 = 446 \text{ miles} \]

So, the distance between her northern home and her southern home is 446 miles."
"Oh, okay. Let me break it down for you step by step, like I'm not so smart.

First, Greta made 12 brownies for herself. Then, she got 6 more from her office party. And at her friends' party, she got 48 brownies. So, she had a total of 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.

During the party, they ate 18 brownies. So, to find out how many she has left, we take the total and subtract the ones that were eaten: 66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta has 48 brownies left over. The answer is 48."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so that makes his brother 16 years old. Nani's sister is younger than him by 25%, which means she is 6 years old. So, if we add up all their ages, Nani is 8, his brother is 16, and his sister is 6. That makes a total of 30 years. So, the total age of all three family members is 30."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Andy has 12 racquets. He needs to string 3 with synthetic gut, 5 with polyester string, and 4 with a special mix that's half synthetic gut and half polyester string.

To string the 3 racquets with synthetic gut, it takes 15 minutes each. So, for 3 racquets, it's 15 minutes x 3 = 45 minutes.

For the 5 racquets with polyester string, it takes 22 minutes each. So, for 5 racquets, it's 22 minutes x 5 = 110 minutes.

For the 4 racquets with the special mix, it takes 18 minutes each. So, for 4 racquets, it's 18 minutes x 4 = 72 minutes.

Now, if we add all these times together, we get 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John wants to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. That's 4 people in total. The first two phones cost $600 each. The next two phones cost half of $600, which is $300 each.

So, we have:
- 2 phones at $600 each = $600 + $600 = $1200
- 2 phones at $300 each = $300 + $300 = $600

Now, we add these together to find the total cost:
- $1200 + $600 = $1800

So, John paid $1800 for all the phones. The answer is $1800."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We know Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, Zeke's team has 13 plus 7, which is 20 players.

Now, to find out how many players are there in both teams combined, we add the number of players in both teams together. So, 13 from Carlton's team plus 20 from Zeke's team makes 33 players in total.

So, the total number of players in both teams is 33."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Robert wants to build a fence around his garden. The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. To make the fence, he needs to go around the garden, so we need to add up all the sides. That's 2 times the length plus 2 times the width, which is 2 * (15 + 10) = 2 * 25 = 50 feet of fence.

Now, he needs 2 slats for every foot of fence. So, for 50 feet, he needs 2 * 50 = 100 slats.

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats. The answer is 100."
"Okay, let me explain it simply without all the big words.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so that's 4 boxes she gave away. That leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes. She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she kept 1/4 * 12 = 3 boxes. That means she sold the rest, which is 12 - 3 = 9 boxes. Each box has 20 oranges, so she sold 9 * 20 = 180 oranges.

So, the number of oranges she sold is 180. The answer is 180."
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

If the USA has 50 states, then half of that would be 25. Now, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. So, India would have 25 plus 4, which is 29 states.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA to the number of states in India:
\[ 50 + 29 = 79 \]

So, the total number of states in both countries together is 79.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"Tyler needs to earn $25 more to buy all the books he wants. If he earns $5 for every hour he works, he needs to work 5 hours to earn $25. So, the number of hours Tyler needs to work is 5 hours. 

The answer is: 5 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, we have 60 cherries to share. Robert has 30 cherries, and that's 10 more than Richard has. So, Richard has 20 cherries. Now, we need to find out how many cherries Jerry has. If we take away the cherries Robert and Richard have from the total, we get 10 cherries left for Jerry.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we take the number of cherries Robert has and subtract the number Jerry has. So, Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10, and 30 minus 10 is 20.

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The answer is 20."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sunny sells gingerbread and apple pie. On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 6 boxes of apple pie. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's see how much money he made:

- For gingerbread, each box costs $6. So, for 10 boxes on Saturday and 15 boxes on Sunday, that's 10 + 15 = 25 boxes. 25 boxes at $6 each is 25 * 6 = $150.
- For apple pie, each box costs $15. So, for 6 boxes on Saturday and 15 boxes on Sunday, that's 6 + 15 = 21 boxes. 21 boxes at $15 each is 21 * 15 = $315.

Now, to find out how much he made in total, we add the money from gingerbread and apple pie together:
$150 + $315 = $465.

So, Sunny made $465 in total. The answer is $465."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Pamela uses sunscreen for 4 hours each day. If she's on vacation for 8 days, she'll be out in the sun for:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

She uses 1 ounce of sunscreen for each hour she's out. So, for 32 hours, she'll need:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \]

Her sunscreen comes in bottles that each hold 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces she needs by the ounces each bottle holds:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \div 8 \text{ ounces/bottle} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, so it's 40% off $100. That means the red car costs $100 - $40 = $60.

So, the blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60. To find out how much both cars cost together, we add them up: $100 + $60 = $160.

So, the total cost of both cars is $160."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way.

Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, that means 5 years from now. At that time, he will be half the age of his dad. So, if Emil is 24, his dad will be 48 (because 24 times 2 is 48). That means his dad is 43 now because 43 plus 5 is 48.

Also, at that time, Emil will be twice as old as his brother. So, if Emil is 24, his brother will be 12 (because 24 divided by 2 is 12). That means his brother is 7 now because 7 plus 5 is 12.

So, if we add Emil's dad's age and his brother's age now, it's 43 plus 7, which is 50.

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 50."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Adrianne got beads from three people. Her mom gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more than her mom, so that's 20 plus 10, which is 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many as her mom, so that's 2 times 20, which is 40 beads. Now, if we add all these together: 20 from mom, 30 from sister, and 40 from friend, we get 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads. So, Adrianne has 90 beads in total."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Joe caught some crawfish on different days. On Thursday, he caught 3 pounds. On Friday, he caught 4 times that, so that's 12 pounds. On Saturday, he caught half of what he caught on Friday, so that's 6 pounds.

Now, if we add all that up, we get:
3 pounds (Thursday) + 12 pounds (Friday) + 6 pounds (Saturday) = 21 pounds total.

Now, if each serving is 3 pounds, we can find out how many servings he has by dividing the total pounds by the pounds per serving:
21 pounds ÷ 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings.

So, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish. The answer is 7."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Mr. Roper has 30 students in his class. Out of these, 20% are football players. So, we calculate 20% of 30, which is 6 students. That means 6 students play football.

Now, we subtract the football players from the total number of students to find out how many are not football players. So, 30 minus 6 gives us 24 students who are not football players.

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, we calculate 25% of 24, which is 6 students. That means 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band.

So, the total number of students who need to leave early is the number of football players plus the number of cheerleaders or band members, which is 6 plus 6, making it 12 students.

So, the number of students leaving early is 12."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Sophie has boots that are size 5. Charlie's boots are five times bigger than Sophie's, so that makes Charlie's boots size 25.

Now, to find the average size, we add Sophie's and Charlie's boot sizes together and then divide by 2. So, 5 plus 25 is 30. Then we divide 30 by 2, which gives us 15.

So, the average size of the boots they both wear is 15. 

The answer is: 15"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Pat wants to fill her flower bed with flowers. Her flower bed is 111 feet long. Each flower takes up 1 foot of space, and there's 1.5 feet of space between each flower.

First, Pat already has 17 flowers. So, she needs to find out how many more flowers she needs to buy. To do this, she thinks about how much space 17 flowers take up and how much space she needs to fill the bed.

17 flowers take up 17 feet (because each flower is 1 foot wide). If she needs 111 feet in total, then she needs 111 - 17 = 94 more feet of flowers. Since each flower takes up 1 foot, she needs 94 more flowers.

But she also needs space between these flowers. If she has 94 flowers, there will be 93 spaces between them. Each space is 1.5 feet, so 93 spaces take up 93 * 1.5 = 139.5 feet.

Now, Pat needs 94 flowers and 139.5 feet of space between them. But she only needs 111 feet in total, so she needs to adjust. She realizes she can't fit 94 flowers and 139.5 feet of space between them in 111 feet. So, she needs to find out how many flowers she can fit in 111 feet.

If she fits 111 feet of flowers and spaces, she can fit 111 / 2 = 55.5 flowers. Since she can't have half a flower, she can fit 55 flowers. This means she needs 55 - 17 = 38 more flowers.

Each flower costs $6, so she needs to spend 38 * $6 = $228.

So, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store is $228."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half as many, so he eats 9 pretzels a day. Now, if we want to know how many pretzels his brother eats in a week, we need to count the days in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

So, if his brother eats 9 pretzels each day, in 7 days he'll eat \( 9 \times 7 = 63 \) pretzels.

Therefore, the answer is 63 pretzels."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Katherine has 5 baskets, and in each basket, she wants to put 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. The petunias cost $3 each, and the sweet potato vines cost $2.50 each.

First, let's find out how much it costs to fill one basket:
- For the petunias: 3 petunias at $3 each is 3 * $3 = $9.
- For the sweet potato vines: 2 vines at $2.50 each is 2 * $2.50 = $5.

So, the total cost for one basket is $9 + $5 = $14.

Now, since she has 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by 5:
- $14 * 5 = $70.

So, Katherine will spend $70 to fill all 5 baskets. The answer is $70."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Artemis and her dad have a big bag of soil that weighs 30 pounds. They use some of it for sunflowers and carnations. Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers, so that's 12 pounds. Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations, so that's 15 pounds. Together, they use 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil for the sunflowers and carnations. They started with 30 pounds, so they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left. Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so with 3 pounds left, they can plant 3 roses. So, the number of roses they can plant is 3."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jessica makes $2,000 a month. She puts aside 25% of that for fancy shoes. So, she saves $500 each month for shoes. In a year, which has 12 months, she saves $500 x 12 = $6,000 for shoes.

Each pair of fancy shoes costs $1,000. So, with $6,000, she can buy $6,000 / $1,000 = 6 pairs of shoes.

So, the answer is 6 pairs of shoes she can buy in a year."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Emily can peel 6 shrimp in one minute. If she wants to peel 90 shrimp, she'll need:

\[
\frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To sauté 90 shrimp, it would take:

\[
\frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/10 minutes}} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time to peel and sauté 90 shrimp is:

\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take her 45 minutes. The answer is 45 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine you have a room that starts at a certain temperature. Now, an air conditioner starts cooling the room. It cools the room by 2 degrees every hour when it's on low. So, if it runs on low for 3 hours, it will cool the room by 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.

Then, the air conditioner goes to high. At high, it cools the room by 3 degrees every hour. So, if it runs on high for 4 hours, it will cool the room by 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.

But here's the tricky part. When the air conditioner is off, the room starts to warm up by 2 degrees every hour. If it's off for 2 hours, the room will warm up by 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.

Now, we need to see how much the room has changed in temperature. The air conditioner cooled the room by 6 degrees and then 12 degrees, so that's 6 + 12 = 18 degrees. But the room also warmed up by 4 degrees. So, the net change is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees.

This means the room is 14 degrees warmer than it was at the start. So, if we want to know how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, it would be 14 degrees lower.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. So, Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Bill saw it again when he was three times that age, so that's 3 times 30, which is 90 years old. If Bill saw it again when he was 90, that means he saw it the first time 75 years before that. So, if he was 90 the second time, he must have been 90 - 75 = 15 years old the first time. So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time."
"Buford writes a check for his electric bill once a month, so that's 12 checks a year. He also writes a check for his gas bill once a month, so that's another 12 checks a year. He writes a check to the church twice a month, so that's 24 checks a year. And he writes a check to the pest and lawn service once every three months, so that's 4 checks a year. If we add all these up, we get 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52 checks a year. So, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is 52."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have two planes at an airport. One plane goes to Greece for three out of every four trips it makes. The rest of the trips are split equally between France and Germany. The other plane only goes to Poland and makes 44 trips. We know that this number (44) is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day.

So, if the first plane makes 44 trips to Poland, it must make twice as many trips in total. That means it makes 88 trips in a day.

Now, since three-quarters of its trips are to Greece, the rest, which is one-quarter, are split equally between France and Germany. So, the number of trips to France is one-quarter of 88, which is 22.

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is 22."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so that's 20 seconds times 2, which is 40 seconds. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so that's 20 seconds plus 40 seconds, which is 60 seconds.

Now, if we add all their howls together, we get 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds, which is 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide 120 seconds by 60 to get the minutes. So, 120 seconds divided by 60 is 2 minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Adam needed $30 to buy new trousers. His mom gave him $6, and his dad gave him twice that amount, which is $12. So, his mom and dad together gave him $6 + $12 = $18.

Adam spent $30 on the trousers, but he only got $18 from his mom and dad. So, he had to use his own money to make up the difference. To find out how much he had to use from his own money, we subtract the $18 from the $30 he needed.

So, $30 - $18 = $12.

Adam had to use $12 from his savings. The answer is $12."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have four kids: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred. We know the total age of all four kids is 20 years. Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old. We need to find out how old Wilfred is.

First, we add Akbar and Alessandro's ages:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, we know the total age of all four kids is 20, so we subtract the sum of Akbar and Alessandro's ages from the total:
\[ 20 - 7 = 13 \]

This means the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is 13 years. We also know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of all four kids. The average age is:
\[ \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, Helene is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now, if Helene is 10 years old, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting Helene's age from the combined age of Helene and Wilfred:
\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

So, Wilfred is 3 years old. The answer is \(\boxed{3}\)."

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from his online fund. So, he had $500 + $1500 = $2000.

Then, his friend gave him $200. So now, he has $2000 + $200 = $2200.

His lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else. So, the lawyer will donate 3 times $2200, which is $6600.

So, the lawyer is going to contribute $6600."

There was a wedding with 100 guests, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, 100 times 15 equals 1500 cookies in total.

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door. Half of 1500 is 750 cookies.

Now, if each person in the church got 15 cookies, we need to find out how many people that is. So, we take the 750 cookies and divide them by 15 cookies per person. That gives us 50 people.

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50."
"Okay, let's think about this like I'm not very smart. We have a big watermelon that we need to share with a family. There are two grown-ups and four kids. The grown-ups get slices that are twice as big as the kids' slices.

If we imagine the watermelon is cut into 8 pieces (4 for the kids and 4 for the grown-ups), each grown-up gets 2 pieces because their slice is twice as big. So, if we look at it, each grown-up gets 2 out of the 8 pieces. To find out what part of the watermelon that is, we do 2 divided by 8, which is 0.25. And 0.25 as a percentage is 25%.

So, each grown-up gets 25% of the watermelon. The answer is 25%."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. Doctor Jones works for 9 hours at the clinic. He spends 3 hours checking on the patients because he has 9 patients and it takes 20 minutes for each. He also has 10 appointments, and each takes 30 minutes, so that's 5 hours. Now, if he works 9 hours and spends 8 hours on patients and appointments, he has 1 hour left to write down what he did. So, the answer is 1 hour."
"To figure out when Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make and serve the cake. Here's how we do it:

- Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.
- Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
- Cooling the cake takes 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
- Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.

First, we add up all these times:
20 minutes + 30 minutes + 120 minutes + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.

Now, we need to convert 180 minutes into hours and minutes. Since 180 minutes is the same as 3 hours, we know it takes 3 hours to make and serve the cake.

Jordan wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find out when she should start, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.

So, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to be ready by 5:00 pm. The answer is:
2:00 pm"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. We need to find out how many chocolate bars are in one box.

If we add the chocolate bars Lisa sold to the chocolate bars Peter sold, we get:
3.5 boxes + 4.5 boxes = 8 boxes

These 8 boxes contain 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
64 chocolate bars ÷ 8 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in one box. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The dance studio charges $25 to rent the place each time they use it. And for each student, they charge an extra $1.50. So, if they have 10 students, that's 10 times $1.50, which is $15 extra for the students. So, the total cost for one session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40.

They rent the studio 3 days a week, so in one week, they make $40 x 3 = $120. If we assume a month has about 4 weeks, then in a month, they make $120 x 4 = $480.

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and he has a total of 64 chocolate bars. So, if we divide 64 by 4, we get how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes. That means each box has 16 chocolate bars.

Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and she has a total of 56 chocolate bars. So, if we divide 56 by 7, we get how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes. That means each box has 8 chocolate bars.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we take the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box and subtract the number in Martha's box. So, 16 minus 8 is 8.

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We start with 50 porcupines. Out of these, 3/5 are females, so we have 30 females. Each of these females has 4 babies every month. There are 12 months in a year, so each female has 4 babies * 12 months = 48 babies in a year. Since there are 30 females, the total number of babies in a year is 30 * 48 = 1440. 

So, at the start, we had 50 porcupines, and we got 1440 babies. That means we have 50 + 1440 = 1490 porcupines in the park after a year.

So, the final number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490."
"Sure, let's break it down in a simpler way.

The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep. To find out how much water we need, we first calculate the volume of the pool. The volume is found by multiplying the length, width, and depth:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, the pool company told us to multiply this volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons} \]

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon, so:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826."
"Oh, okay! Let me break it down for you. They have 9 red sticks. Now, for the blue sticks, they have 5 more than the red ones, so that's 9 plus 5, which makes 14 blue sticks. And for the yellow sticks, they have 3 less than the blue ones, so that's 14 minus 3, which is 11 yellow sticks. Now, to find out how many sticks they have in total, we add them all up: 9 red, 14 blue, and 11 yellow. That makes 9 plus 14 plus 11, which is 34 sticks. So, they have 34 sticks in total."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Matteo drove for 4 hours at 55 miles per hour. So, he drove:
\[ 55 \times 4 = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Shandy drove for 10 hours at 45 miles per hour. So, he drove:
\[ 45 \times 10 = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many more miles Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract:
\[ 450 - 220 = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The answer is 230 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The school has 3000 students in total. Half of them are older than 16, so that's 1500 students. Out of these 1500, one-fourth are boys, so that's 375 boys. That means the rest, which are 1125, are girls.

Now, the other half of the students are younger than 16. So, that's also 1500 students. Out of these 1500, half are boys, so that's 750 boys. That means the rest, which are 750, are girls.

So, to find out how many girls there are in total, we add the girls who are older than 16 to the girls who are younger than 16. That's 1125 plus 750, which equals 1875.

So, the total number of female students at the school is 1875."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Bethany can run 10 laps in an hour. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so that's 10 + 4 = 14 laps. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so that's 14 / 2 = 7 laps. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so that's 7 - 2 = 5 laps. Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract Quinn's laps from Bethany's laps. So, 10 - 5 = 5 laps. Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easier to understand.

We have a big tank that can hold 18000 gallons of water. Wanda and Ms. B are working together to fill the tank. On the first day, Wanda fills 4500 gallons, and Ms. B fills 3375 gallons. So, together they fill 7875 gallons on the first day.

On the second day, Wanda fills 3000 gallons, and Ms. B fills 1125 gallons. So, together they fill 4125 gallons on the second day.

In total, they fill 7875 gallons on the first day and 4125 gallons on the second day, which makes 12000 gallons in total.

Now, we subtract the total gallons they filled from the tank's total capacity to find out how much is left:
18000 gallons - 12000 gallons = 6000 gallons.

So, the tank has 6000 gallons of water left to be full. The answer is 6000 gallons."
"Oh, okay. Let me explain this like I'm not so smart.

Maria had a power bank, and she wanted to charge her friends' phones. She noticed her power bank wasn't fully charged after she left for the park. After 5 hours, the power bank lost 9% of its charge each hour, so it was 53.4% left. Then for the next 3 hours, it lost 7% each hour, and it ended up at 28% charge.

To find out how much charge it had when she left, we need to work backwards. First, we figure out what 53.4% is when we add 7% back to it. That means 53.4% is 28% of the original charge. So, if 53.4% is 28%, then the original charge must have been 52.4%.

So, the power bank was about 52.4% charged when Maria went to the park. If we had to pick from the options, it would be around 52.4%.

The answer is: **52.4%**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Janet gets paid $10 an hour for her job and $15 an hour for tips. So, she gets $25 an hour total. If she works 40 hours a week, she makes $1000 a week.

She wants to save up to buy a $10,000 car, and that means she needs to save 20% of $10,000, which is $2000.

If she makes $1000 a week, to save $2000, she needs to work for 2 weeks.

So, the answer is 2 weeks."
"Jamaar has $10 to spend. He bought some fruits and we need to find out how much money he has left to buy plums.

He bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each, so 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- 2 kiwis at $1.0 each, so 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- 5 apples at $0.75 each, so 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the cost of these fruits:
$1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

So, he spent $9.25 and he started with $10. The money he has left is:
$10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. With $0.75, he can buy:
$0.75 / $0.25 = 3 plums

So, the number of plums he can buy is 3."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Anne bought a big box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, she has 900 pieces of sweets in total.

She kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 13 packs to her friends. She has 10 friends, so she divides those 13 packs equally among them. That means each friend gets 1.3 packs.

Since each pack has 60 pieces, each friend gets 1.3 times 60 pieces. When you do the math, each friend gets 78 pieces of sweets.

So, each friend got 78 pieces. The answer is 78."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine you have carrots that cost $120. Every year, the price goes up by 5%. We want to know how much they'll cost after three years.

First, let's see how much the price goes up each year. If it goes up by 5%, that means if the carrots cost $120, they'll cost $120 + 5% of $120 after the first year. 

5% of $120 is $6 (because 5% is the same as 5/100, and 5/100 of 120 is 6).

So, after the first year, the carrots will cost $120 + $6 = $126.

Now, we do the same thing for the second year. The price is now $126. So, 5% of $126 is $6.30 (because 5% of 126 is 0.05 * 126 = 6.30).

Adding that to $126, the price after the second year is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

For the third year, we do the same thing. 5% of $132.30 is $6.615 (because 5% of 132.30 is 0.05 * 132.30 = 6.615).

Adding that to $132.30, the price after the third year is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Now, we round $138.915 to the nearest dollar, and that gives us $139.

So, the price of carrots after three years would be $139."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook and divided them into 8 albums. She put 3 albums for selfies and 2 albums for portraits. The rest of the albums were for other stuff.

Since she has 8 albums in total, and 3 are for selfies and 2 are for portraits, that leaves 3 albums for other things. But the question doesn't say how many selfies and portraits are in those 3 albums, so we assume they are split evenly between selfies and portraits. So, 2 of those 3 albums are for selfies and 1 is for portraits.

Now, if each album has the same number of pictures, and there are 72 pictures in total, then each album has 72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album.

So, for selfies (2 albums), that's 2 albums * 9 pictures per album = 18 selfies.
And for portraits (1 album), that's 1 album * 9 pictures per album = 9 portraits.

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is 18 + 9 = 27.

The final answer is 27."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. That means he reads 1 page in 10/3 minutes, which is about 3.33 minutes per page.

Now, James reads 18 pages. So, if he reads 1 page in 3.33 minutes, then 18 pages would be 18 times 3.33 minutes.

\[ 18 \times 3.33 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The answer is 60 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, we start with 100 guests in the hotel. Then, 24 guests leave early, so we have:

\[ 100 - 24 = 76 \]

Then, 15 more guests leave late, so we have:

\[ 76 - 15 = 61 \]

Now, 30 more guests come in because it's after the late checkouts, so we add those:

\[ 61 + 30 = 91 \]

And then, 7 more guests come in after dinner, so we add those too:

\[ 91 + 7 = 98 \]

So, the hotel now has 98 guests."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas. On Thursday, he picks 6 more bananas. On Friday, he picks three times as many as he did on Wednesday, which is 3 times 4, so that's 12 bananas.

Now, if we add all the bananas together: 4 (Wednesday) + 6 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) = 22 bananas.

So, John has 22 bananas in total. The answer is 22."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easier to understand.

We have a quiz with 60 questions. Out of these, 40% are easy questions. So, we calculate how many easy questions there are:

40% of 60 is 24 questions.

Now, the rest of the questions are split into two groups: average and difficult. Since 40% are easy, the other 60% are split equally between average and difficult. So, we have:

60% of 60 is 36 questions, and half of these are average and half are difficult. So, we have 18 average questions and 18 difficult questions.

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions right. So, for the easy questions:

75% of 24 is 18 questions.

She's also sure to get half of the average and difficult questions right. So, for the average and difficult questions:

Half of 18 is 9 questions.

Now, if we add up all the questions Aries is sure to get right:

18 (easy) + 9 (average) + 9 (difficult) = 36 questions.

So, Aries is sure to get 36 points."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Teresa sells small and big stuffed animals. Small ones cost $4 each, and big ones cost three times that, so they cost $12 each.

Today, she sold twice as many small ones as big ones. She made $120 in total.

If she sold 6 big ones, then she sold 12 small ones because she sold twice as many small ones as big ones.

So, the number of small stuffed animals she sold is 12.

The answer is: **12**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a family. The daddy eats 5 sandwiches a day, the mommy eats 4 sandwiches a day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches a day. So, if we add them all up, daddy, mommy, and son eat 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches a day.

Now, there are 7 days in a week. So, if they eat 11 sandwiches a day, in a week they'll eat 11 sandwiches/day × 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week.

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Suzanne sold cookies and cupcakes. She sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so that's 80 dollars. Then she sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so that's 60 times 4, which is 240 dollars. So in total, she got 80 plus 240 dollars, which is 320 dollars.

She gave her sisters 10 dollars each, so that's 2 times 10, which is 20 dollars.

Now, if she had 320 dollars and gave away 20 dollars, she would have 320 minus 20, which is 300 dollars left.

So, the money she has left is 300 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

There were 100 eggs hidden. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so that's 60 eggs found by them. That leaves 40 eggs left. But 10 of those were not found by anyone. So, the friends found the rest.

To find out how many the friends found, we take the 40 eggs left and subtract the 10 that weren't found:

\[ 40 - 10 = 30 \]

So, the friends found 30 eggs. The answer is 30."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

First, we know one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore a day. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine twice as much as with a bare hand, which is 24 pounds a day. And with a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 18 pounds a day.

Now, if we have 40 dwarves all mining with steel pickaxes, each dwarf mines 18 pounds a day. So, 40 dwarves would mine \(40 \times 18 = 720\) pounds a day.

In a month with 30 days, they would mine \(720 \times 30 = 21600\) pounds.

So, the total amount of ore they can mine in a month is 21600 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have sandwiches in different packages, and we know how much they cost for the first two:

- The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3. So, each sandwich costs $3 ÷ 2 = $1.5.
- The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. So, each sandwich costs $6 ÷ 4 = $1.5.

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use this to find out how much the third package costs. The third package has 8 sandwiches, and since each sandwich costs $1.5, the total cost for 8 sandwiches is 8 × $1.5 = $12.

So, the package with 8 sandwiches costs $12."
"Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000 and sells his old one for $1000. So, he only has to pay $2000 for the new set. He has to pay 10% of $2000 every month. To find out how much he pays each month, we calculate 10% of $2000, which is $200. So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. The answer is:

$200"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Sally started with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. First, 40% of the red balloons burst. So, 40% of 25 is 10, and that means 10 red balloons burst. So, Sally has 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.

Then, Sally accidentally let go of half of the yellow balloons. Half of 12 is 6, so she let go of 6 yellow balloons. That means she has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her collection. 75% of 8 is 6, so she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.

So, Sally has 15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue balloons. That's a total of 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons.

So, Sally carried 34 balloons into the school."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Marcus has a homework to do. There's a chance he might not have to do it tomorrow. Here's how it works:

1. If a substitute teacher comes, there's a 50% chance he'll collect the homework. But if the substitute teacher comes, there's also a 50% chance he'll let Marcus off. So, the chance he has to do it is 50% of 50%, which is 25%.

2. If the normal teacher comes, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. That means 60% of the time, Marcus won't get an extension and has to do his homework. But if he doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance he can convince the teacher his dog ate his homework. So, 20% of 60% is 12%.

Now, we add these two chances together:
- 25% (if substitute teacher)
- 12% (if normal teacher)

25% + 12% = 37%

So, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 37%. 

The best answer is C: 37%."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The school has a big hall that can hold 6000 people. They put 950 seats for the graduates and 300 seats for the teachers. So, they've already used up 1250 seats.

Now, they have 6000 - 1250 = 4750 seats left. There are 950 graduates, and they want to split these 4750 seats equally among them.

So, each graduate gets 4750 / 950 = 5 seats.

Each graduate gets 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. So, the answer is 5."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easy to understand.

Grandpa likes to eat jelly beans, but he eats different amounts depending on how big the beans are. For big beans, he can eat 75 of them to feel full. Now, for medium beans, he can eat twice as many as the big ones. So, if he can eat 75 big beans, he can eat:
\[ 75 \times 2 = 150 \text{ medium beans} \]

Next, we know that 3 small beans are the same as 1 medium bean. So, to find out how many small beans he can eat, we need to figure out how many small beans are in 150 medium beans. Since 3 small beans are like 1 medium bean, then:
\[ 150 \text{ medium beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium bean} = 450 \text{ small beans} \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small beans. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{450}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Melissa has to sit in the court for 6 hours each day for 3 days. So, she spends:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

She gets paid $15 each day for 3 days, so her total pay is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

But she also has to pay $3 each day for parking, so her total parking cost is:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

So, her net pay after expenses is:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much she gets paid per hour, we divide her net pay by the total hours she worked:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa gets paid $2 per hour after all the expenses. The answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ted starts with $200. He buys 3 books that cost $16 each. So, 3 times $16 is $48. Then he buys 3 pencils that cost $6 each. So, 3 times $6 is $18. Now, to find out how much he spent in total, we add $48 and $18 together. 

$48 plus $18 is $66. So, Ted spent $66 in total. 

The answer is: **$66**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Richard wants to make a video of a soda fountain. His driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet. So, he needs to put 8 bottles of soda because 24 divided by 3 is 8.

Now, he has to go from one bottle to the next to put the candy in. It takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. But he doesn't go from the first bottle to the last bottle directly. He goes from the first to the second, then the second to the third, and so on, until he gets to the last bottle. So, he goes from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and so on, which is 7 times.

Since it takes 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next, and he does this 7 times, he spends 5 seconds x 7 times = 35 seconds in total.

So, it will take Richard 35 seconds to set off all the soda fountains."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 40 apples in one box, and Uncle Franky got two boxes. So, we have 40 times 2, which is 80 apples in total.

Now, he wants to pack these apples with 8 apples in each pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack. So, 80 apples divided by 8 apples per pack equals 10 packs.

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples. The answer is 10 packs."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound, so that's 2 times 11, which is 22 dollars. Then she buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound, so that's 3 times 6, which is 18 dollars. So, the total cost is 22 plus 18, which is 40 dollars.

Amor started with 50 dollars. If she spends 40 dollars on cheese, she will have 50 minus 40, which is 10 dollars left.

So, the money Amor will have left to buy meat is 10 dollars."

Jim went to college for 4 years. He borrowed $50,000 each year, so he borrowed a total of $200,000. After college, his job pays him $75,000 a year because his job tripled.

Before college, he was making $25,000 a year. So, for 4 years in college, he didn't earn anything. After college, he'll make $75,000 a year, but he has to pay back the $200,000 he borrowed.

To pay back the $200,000, he needs to earn $400,000 in total. If he makes $75,000 a year, we divide $400,000 by $75,000 to see how many years it will take him to earn that much.

\[ \frac{400,000}{75,000} = 5.33 \]

Since he can't work a part of a year, he'll need to work for 6 years to earn enough to pay back his loans and make up for the time he didn't work in college.

So, the answer is 6 years."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jim's bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. He needs fabric that's 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the fabric he needs is 8 feet long and 10 feet wide.

To find out how much fabric he needs, we multiply the length by the width of the fabric. So, we do 8 feet times 10 feet, which gives us 80 square feet for one piece of fabric.

Since Jim needs two pieces, we do 80 square feet times 2, which gives us 160 square feet.

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric. The answer is 160 square feet."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

On Monday, they gave out 425 letters. On Tuesday, they gave out 17 more than one-fifth of Monday's letters. So, one-fifth of Monday's letters is 425 divided by 5, which is 85. Then they added 17 more, so that's 85 plus 17, which is 102 letters on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, they gave out 5 more than twice the number they gave out on Tuesday. So, twice Tuesday's letters is 102 times 2, which is 204. Then they added 5 more, so that's 204 plus 5, which is 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, to find out how many letters they gave out from Monday to Wednesday, we add Monday's, Tuesday's, and Wednesday's letters together: 425 plus 102 plus 209. That makes 736 letters in total.

So, the post office gave out 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Molly is having a party and she invited 16 people. Out of those, 10 people want chicken salad which costs $6.50 per person, and 6 people want pasta salad which costs $6 per person.

First, we calculate how much the chicken salad will cost:
- 10 people * $6.50 = $65

Next, we calculate how much the pasta salad will cost:
- 6 people * $6 = $36

Now, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together:
- $65 + $36 = $101

So, Molly will pay $101 for the catering. The answer is $101."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Johnny's dad lost some money in horse races. Here's what happened:

1. In the first race, they lost $5.
2. In the second race, they won $1 more than twice what they lost in the first race. So, twice $5 is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. So, they won $11 in the second race.
3. In the third race, they lost 1.5 times what they won in the second race. So, 1.5 times $11 is $16.5. They lost $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's add up all the money they lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (they won)
- Third race: $16.5

Total money lost: $5 + $0 + $16.5 = $21.5

To find out how much they lost on average, we divide the total money lost by the number of races:
- Total races: 3
- Average money lost per race: $21.5 ÷ 3 = $7.1667

So, on average, they lost about $7.17 each time. 

The answer is: **$7.17**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 26 countries in South America, and in each country, there are 5 cities. So, we have 26 times 5 cities, which is 130 cities. Now, in each of these cities, there are 1000 people living. So, to find out how many people there are in total, we multiply the number of cities by the number of people in each city. That means 130 cities times 1000 people per city equals 130,000 people.

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, Xavier was 4 feet tall, which is 48 inches. He grew 3 inches, so his new height is 51 inches.

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is 52 inches.

Now, to find out how much taller Cole is than Xavier, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, Cole is 1 inch taller than Xavier. The answer is 1 inch."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have three people dividing $1920. The second person gets $80 more than the first person, and the third person gets twice what the second person gets. We need to find out how much the first person got.

Let's say the first person got $x. Then the second person got $x + $80, and the third person got $2(x + $80).

If we add all these up, we get:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person got $420."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Imagine 4 painters working on a big house. They work for 3/8 of a day every day for 3 weeks. We need to find out how many hours each painter worked.

First, we find out how many days they worked. There are 7 days in a week, so in 3 weeks, that's 3 times 7, which is 21 days. But they only worked for 3/8 of a day each day, so we multiply 21 by 3/8. That gives us 63/8, which is 7.875 days.

Now, if we add up all the hours they worked, it's 7.875 days times 4 painters, which equals 31.5 hours in total.

Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours by 4 to find out how many hours each painter worked. So, 31.5 hours divided by 4 is 7.875 hours.

So, each painter worked 7.875 hours. 

The answer is: 7.875 hours"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Imagine Rory had to pick up balls after a game. In the second set, he picked up 6 balls. For the first set, he picked up 4 more balls than in the second set, so that's 6 + 4 = 10 balls. For the third set, he picked up half as many as in the second set, so that's 6 / 2 = 3 balls.

Now, if we add up all the balls he picked up:
10 (first set) + 6 (second set) + 3 (third set) = 19 balls.

So, Rory picked up 10 balls in the first set. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

In 2007, Ben bought a car for $20,000. The car loses 21% of its value each year. We need to find out how much it's worth in 2010.

First, let's see how much it loses in one year. If it loses 21%, it keeps 79% of what it was worth before. So, in 2008, the car would be worth:
\[ 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800 \]

Then, in 2009, it loses another 21% of $15,800:
\[ 15800 \times 0.79 = 12522 \]

And in 2010, it loses another 21% of $12,522:
\[ 12522 \times 0.79 = 9830.18 \]

So, in 2010, the car would be worth $9830.18.

If we had to pick from some options, let's say the closest option is $9800, then the answer would be $9800.

So, the price of the car in 2010 is $9800."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 50 books in the library. Half of them are in English, so that's 25 books. Then 10% of them are in German. To find out how many German books there are, we take 10% of 50, which is 5 books.

Now, to find out how many are in Spanish, we take the total number of books and subtract the number of English and German books. So, we do 50 minus 25 (English) and 5 (German), which gives us 20 books in Spanish.

So, there are 20 Spanish books in the library."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The total distance from San Diego to New York is about 1955 kilometers. Bernice drove 325 kilometers. To find out how many more kilometers she needs to drive, we take the total distance and subtract the distance she already drove.

So, 1955 kilometers minus 325 kilometers equals 1630 kilometers.

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.

The answer is: 1630 kilometers."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. If there are 16 cups in a gallon, we want to know how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

First, we find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days. She drinks 8 cups a day, so in 30 days, she drinks:
\[ 8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we need to know how many gallons that is. Since 16 cups make a gallon, we divide the total cups by 16:
\[ 240 \div 16 = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days. The answer is 15 gallons."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Romeo starts with 120 people on the train. At the first stop, 20 more people get on, so that's 120 + 20 = 140 people.

Then at the second stop, 50 people get off and 100 people get on. So, 140 - 50 = 90, and then 90 + 100 = 190 people.

At the third stop, 80 people get off, so 190 - 80 = 110 people are left.

So, at the final stop, there are 110 people on the train. The answer is 110."
"Alison went shopping for some running stuff. She bought a tank top for $10, running shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top, so that's $10 + $5 = $15. Then she got tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so that's $48 / 2 = $24. She also bought some socks that were $8 but had a $2 coupon, so that's $8 - $2 = $6. Adding all these up, $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55. So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear. The answer is $55."
"To figure out how much it will cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to know how many tiles we need and then multiply that by the cost of each tile.

The kitchen floor is 200 square feet big, and each tile is 1 square foot because it's a square tile with each side being 1 foot. So, we need 200 tiles to cover the whole floor.

Each tile costs $12. To find out the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

So, it will cost $2400 to renovate the kitchen floor. The answer is $2400."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James had to pay more money for his insurance because he had an accident. The normal cost is $120 a month, but now it's 60% more. So, we first find out how much more that is. 60% of $120 is $72. So, now the insurance costs $120 + $72 = $192 a month.

Now, to find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply $192 by 12 (because there are 12 months in a year). So, $192 times 12 is $2304.

But the question asks for the answer in a multiple-choice format, and the options are usually given. If the options were something like $1440, $1800, $2160, or $2304, then the answer would be $2304.

So, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Greg needs to put clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king bed every week. His washing machine can only handle 2 twin sets at a time and 1 king set at a time.

For the twin beds, he needs 2 loads because 4 beds divided by 2 beds per load equals 2 loads.

For the king bed, he needs 1 load because he only has 1 king bed.

So, in total, he needs 2 loads for the twin beds plus 1 load for the king bed, which makes 3 loads per week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so he does 3 loads per week times 52 weeks in a year, which equals 156 loads in a year.

So, the answer is 156 loads of laundry in a year."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

They watch 4 movies on Saturday and half that on Sunday, so that's 4 plus 2 movies. That's 6 movies in one weekend. Now, if they do this every weekend for 4 weeks, they watch 6 movies per weekend times 4 weekends, which is 24 movies in total.

So, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 24."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he got 50 more stickers. This year, he got twice as many as he did last year, so that's 100 stickers.

So, if we add all that up:
- Two years ago: 100 stickers
- Last year: 50 stickers
- This year: 100 stickers

That makes 100 + 50 + 100 = 250 stickers in total.

So, Leo has 250 stickers now."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them 60 grams of food twice a day. So, each cat eats 120 grams a day (60 grams twice). All 3 cats together eat 360 grams a day.

Now, Imma has 720 grams of food. To find out how many days this will last, we divide the total food by the amount the cats eat in a day. 

\[ 720 \text{ grams} \div 360 \text{ grams/day} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of food will last for 2 days. The answer is 2 days."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices. So, in total, there are 4 times 8 slices, which is 32 slices.

Becky ate 10 slices. Jake ate 3 less than Becky, so Jake ate 10 minus 3, which is 7 slices.

Silvia ate twice as much as Jake, so Silvia ate 7 times 2, which is 14 slices.

Now, we add up all the slices they ate: Becky's 10 slices, Jake's 7 slices, and Silvia's 14 slices. That's 10 plus 7 plus 14, which equals 31 slices.

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, we have two people making a meal. Donovan took some time, and Betsy took a bit longer. The total time they took together was 98 minutes. Donovan took 40 minutes, and Betsy took 18 more minutes than Donovan. So, Betsy took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

That means Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes."
"Okay, let me break it down simply. Hannah had to pay $200 for the cast. For the visit, the doctor charges $300 for half an hour, so that's $150. She also needs 30 painkillers at $4 each, so that's $120. And for parking, she has to pay $6 for every hour, and since it's a minimum of 2 hours, that's $12.

Now, if we add all these up: $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James gets 80 emails a day. Out of those, 20% don't need a reply. So, the rest do. To find out how many emails need a reply, we first figure out what 20% of 80 is. 

20% of 80 is 16 emails (because 80 times 20 over 100 is 16). So, that means 80 minus 16 equals 64 emails need a reply each day.

Now, James works 5 days in a week. So, we multiply the number of emails that need a reply each day by 5.

64 times 5 is 320.

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week. The answer is 320."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Last week, the Science Center had different numbers of classes visiting each day. Here's how it went:

- On Monday, 32 classes came.
- On Tuesday, it was twice as many as Monday, so that's 64 classes.
- On Wednesday, it was three times as many as Monday, so that's 96 classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes came.
- On Friday, 25 classes came.

Now, to find out the total, we add all these numbers together:
32 (Monday) + 64 (Tuesday) + 96 (Wednesday) + 30 (Thursday) + 25 (Friday) = 247

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John took 4 tests. He got 100 on the first three tests and 80 on the fourth test. To find out his average score, we add up all the scores and then divide by the number of tests.

So, 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380. That's the total score.

He took 4 tests, so we divide 380 by 4 to find the average.

380 ÷ 4 = 95

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. So, they ate:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
That means they left:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]
pizzas.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
pizzas. They ate 80% of their pizzas, so they ate:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
That means they left:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]
pizzas.

Now, to find out how many pizzas are left in total, we add the pizzas left by both groups:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the total number of pizzas left is 14."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons and twice as many big ones. So, he sends 1400 big coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he sends 700 of them, so that's 700 times 5 cents, which is 3500 cents. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, and he sends 1400 of them, so that's 1400 times 15 cents, which is 21000 cents.

Now, to find out the total cost, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big ones together. So, 3500 cents plus 21000 cents equals 24500 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we divide 24500 by 100 to get the total cost in dollars. 24500 cents is the same as 245 dollars.

So, Anthony spends 245 dollars on postage. The answer is 245 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

First, Sidney ordered 7 meatball subs because 10 minus 3 is 7.

Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's subs, so Sidney had 7 minus 4, which is 3 subs left.

After that, Sidney ordered 3 more subs, so now Sidney has 3 plus 3, which is 6 subs.

Each sub has 4 meatballs, so for 6 subs, we multiply 6 by 4, which gives us 24 meatballs.

So, the number of meatballs in the subs that remained is 24."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertilizer. But two hours after they left, 5 trucks had problems and couldn't deliver. So, only 15 trucks could deliver the fertilizer.

Now, if each truck can carry 20 tons, then 15 trucks would carry:

\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

So, the total amount of fertilizer that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons. The answer is 300 tons."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, and he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. So, he needs 6 pounds of butter.

The store has a deal: buy 1 pound of butter and get the next pound half off. The butter costs $4.00 a pound.

First, Dennis buys 2 pounds of butter. He pays $4.00 for the first pound and gets the second pound for half off, which is $4.00 / 2 = $2.00. So, for 2 pounds, he pays $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

He needs 6 pounds, so he needs to do this 3 times (2 pounds at a time). So, he pays $6.00 three times, which is $6.00 * 3 = $18.00.

But the question asks for the cost, and the options are usually given. If the options are $12.00, $18.00, or another, the correct answer based on our calculation is:

\boxed{18}"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members. That makes 45 people in total. But 4 people can't come, so 41 people will be at the party.

The theater costs $125 to rent, and then there's an extra $6 for each person after the first 20. So, for the 21 people after the first 20, that's 21 times $6, which is $126.

Now, we add the $125 for the theater to the $126 for the extra people. That makes $251 in total.

So, the party will cost Kayla $251."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Maggie had $60 and she spent a quarter of it, which is $15. So, she has $60 - $15 = $45 left. Riza also had $60 and she spent one-third of it, which is $20. So, she has $60 - $20 = $40 left. Now, if we add what Maggie and Riza have left, we get $45 + $40 = $85. So, the total amount of money they have left is $85."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas. He has three monkeys, and he can feed them for a week with these bananas. One monkey eats 10 bananas a day, so in a week, that's 70 bananas. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first one, so that's 14 bananas a day, which is 98 bananas in a week. The first and second monkeys together eat 70 + 98 = 168 bananas in a week.

Now, if Mr. Robles has 315 bananas in total, and the first two monkeys eat 168 bananas, then the third monkey must eat the rest. So, 315 - 168 = 147 bananas for the third monkey in a week.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the third monkey eats 147 ÷ 7 = 21 bananas each day.

So, the third monkey eats 21 bananas each day. The answer is 21."
"Oh, okay. So Teddy started with one big puzzle that had 500 pieces. He put half of it together, which is 250 pieces. Then he started another big puzzle and finished that one too. That's another 500 pieces. So in total, he put together 250 pieces from the first puzzle and 500 pieces from the second puzzle. That makes 750 pieces in total. So Teddy put together 750 pieces in that hour."
"Jenny bought 15 roses, and each rose costs $2. So, the total cost for the roses is $2 times 15, which is $30. Jenny had five $5 bills, so she had $25. To pay for the roses, she needs $5 more. Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, she will get 20 quarters as change. So, the number of quarters she leaves with is 20. The answer is 20."
"Okay, let me break it down simply. Terry sells milkshakes for $5.50 each, and he sells 6 of them. So, that's 6 times $5.50, which is $33. Then he sells nine burger platters for $11 each, so that's 9 times $11, which is $99. And he sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so that's 20 times $1.50, which is $30. Now, if we add all these up: $33 + $99 + $30, we get $162. So, Terry makes $162 in total."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way.

Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. The first train comes in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. The second train comes 30 minutes after the first one leaves (which is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes) and stays for 5 minutes. The third train comes 60 minutes after the second one leaves (which is 30 + 5 = 35 minutes) and leaves right away. The fourth train comes 20 minutes after the third one leaves (which is 35 + 20 = 55 minutes), so Paul will wait for 140 minutes in total.

So, Paul will wait for his train for 130 minutes. 

The answer is: 130 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Melanie needs 200 toothpicks for her toothpick sculpture. She has already saved 120 toothpicks. So, she needs 80 more toothpicks.

She saves 10 toothpicks each week. To get 80 more toothpicks, she needs to save for 8 more weeks because 80 divided by 10 is 8.

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to save the rest of the toothpicks. The answer is 8 weeks."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way without all the big words.

Mr. Rogers bought a watch that was originally $2000. But the store put it on sale, so he only paid 75% of the original price. To find out how much he paid, we do this:

\[ 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 \]

So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

Then, he sold it to his friend for 120% of what he paid. To find out how much he sold it for, we do this:

\[ 1500 \times 1.20 = 1800 \]

So, he sold the watch for $1800.

Now, to find out how much discount his friend got, we need to see how much less the friend paid compared to the original price. The original price was $2000, and he paid $1800, so the discount is:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \]

To find the percentage discount, we use this formula:

\[ \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, Mr. Rogers' friend got a 10% discount. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{10\%}

Imagine we have 5 springs, and each spring makes a new jellyfish every second. Now, we want to know how many jellyfish 5 springs can make in 4 hours.

First, we need to know how many seconds are in 4 hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, so in 4 hours, there are:
\[ 4 \times 60 \times 60 = 14400 \text{ seconds} \]

Since each spring makes one jellyfish every second, in 14400 seconds, one spring will make:
\[ 14400 \text{ jellyfish} \]

Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same time, they will make:
\[ 5 \times 14400 = 72000 \text{ jellyfish} \]

So, the number of jellyfish 5 springs can make in 4 hours is 72000."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Binkie scored 90 points. Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. So, we first find out what twice Binkie's score is:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \]

Then we add 15 to that:

\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195. That's the answer."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

James walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, and then he has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles. So, he walks a total of 4 miles. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find out how long it took him, we divide the total distance by his speed:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

So, it took James 1 hour to reach the store. The answer is 1 hour."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, she gets 10 times 4 bananas, which is 40 bananas in total.

Now, if she buys bananas individually at $0.80 each, she would spend $0.80 times 40 bananas, which is $32.00.

But if she buys the bananas by the bunch, each bunch costs $3.00, and she buys 10 bunches, so she spends $3.00 times 10 bunches, which is $30.00.

So, she saves $32.00 minus $30.00, which is $2.00.

The answer is $2.00."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. So, if we say Sam gets \( S \) feet, Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. When we add these together, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Then we subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

And then we divide by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. That means the leftover for Sam is 20 feet."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, to find out how much it grows in one year, we divide 8 inches by 4 years, which gives us 2 inches per year.

Now, if we want to know how much it grows in 13 years, we take the 2 inches it grows in one year and multiply it by 13 years. So, 2 inches/year times 13 years equals 26 inches.

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years. The answer is 26 inches."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. Marcel sells different types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. He sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so that's 150 bikes. 15% of the bikes were BMX, which means 45 bikes. The rest were MTB bikes, so that's 105 bikes.

Now, let's see how much money he made from each type of bike:
- For Trekking bikes, each one costs $450, so 150 bikes make him $450 * 150 = $67,500.
- For BMX bikes, each one costs half of $500, which is $250, so 45 bikes make him $250 * 45 = $11,250.
- For MTB bikes, each one costs $500, so 105 bikes make him $500 * 105 = $52,500.

To find out how much he made in total, we add up all these amounts:
$67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

So, Marcel made $131,250 from selling bicycles that month. The answer is $131,250."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, the farmer makes 5 hay bales every hour. That means in 6 hours, he makes 5 times 6, which is 30 bales.

The truck picks up 3 bales every hour. So in 6 hours, the truck picks up 3 times 6, which is 18 bales.

Now, to find out how many bales are left, we take the bales the farmer made and subtract the bales the truck picked up. So, 30 minus 18 is 12.

So, the number of bales left in the field is 12.

The answer is 12."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John has 8 classes a day, and each class is 40 minutes long. So, he spends 320 minutes a day in class. He goes to class 5 days a week, so that's 1600 minutes a week in class.

On the weekend, he spends 1/16 of his weekly class time learning extra. His weekly class time is 1600 minutes, so 1/16 of that is 100 minutes.

So, in total, he spends 1600 minutes in class and 100 minutes extra learning, which is 1700 minutes a week.

Now, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1700 minutes is 1700 / 60 = 28.33 hours.

So, John spends 28.33 hours a week learning. The answer is 28.33 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Nathan drops a bouncy ball from the third floor of a mall. Each story is 24 feet high, so the ball starts at 72 feet.

When the ball bounces, it goes up to 2/3 of its height. So, after the first bounce, it goes up to:

\[ 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Then, it bounces again to 2/3 of 48 feet:

\[ 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, on the second bounce, the ball goes up to 32 feet. 

The answer is: 32 feet."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, we start with the first child who is 72 inches tall because 6 feet is 72 inches. The second child is 2 inches taller, so that makes 74 inches. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second, so that's 74 - 5 = 69 inches. The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, so that's 69 + 3 = 72 inches.

So, the fourth child is 72 inches tall."
"Sure, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The orchard sold 2000 apples, and each bag has 10 apples. So, to find out how many bags they sold, we divide the total apples by the number of apples in each bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Now, if each bag is sold for $5, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag to find out how much they earned:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the orchard earned $1000."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Imagine we have a big piece of meat, and a big dinosaur called T-Rex eats half of it. So now we have half of the meat left. Then, some other little dinosaurs called Velociraptors come and eat half of what's left. After that, a bigger dinosaur called Allosaurus eats the rest, and it eats 270 kilograms.

If we think about it, before the Allosaurus ate, there was 270 kilograms left, which is half of what was left after the Velociraptors ate. So, before the Velociraptors ate, there was 270 times 2, which is 540 kilograms. And before the T-Rex ate, there was 540 times 2, which is 1080 kilograms.

So, the triceratops had 1080 kilograms of meat before the T-Rex ate."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step. Tony has a room with four walls. The north and south walls are each 10 feet by 8 feet, so that's 10 times 8 for each wall, and since there are two of them, that's 160 square feet for both. The east and west walls are each 5 feet by 8 feet, so that's 5 times 8 for each wall, and since there are two of them, that's 80 square feet for both.

So, the total area of all the walls is 160 plus 80, which is 240 square feet. Now, a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons Tony needs, we divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon: 240 divided by 20 is 12 gallons.

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so to find the total cost, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon: 12 gallons times $12 per gallon equals $144.

So, the total cost to paint the room is $144."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way that's easier to understand.

Ellen had 12 sodas. She shook 3 of them and left 9 sodas. Her brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, so there were 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas left. Ellen's friend then picks one of the sodas.

There are 2 shaken sodas out of the 4 sodas left. So, the chance that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda is 2 out of 4, which simplifies to 1 out of 2. In percentage, that's 50%.

So, the chance that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 50%. The answer is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have two trains going in opposite directions. One is going 60 miles an hour and the other is going half that, which is 30 miles an hour. After 3 hours, we want to know how far apart they are.

First, we figure out how far each train goes in 3 hours:
- The first train goes 60 miles an hour, so in 3 hours, it goes \(60 \times 3 = 180\) miles.
- The second train goes 30 miles an hour, so in 3 hours, it goes \(30 \times 3 = 90\) miles.

Now, since they're going in opposite directions, we add the distances they each traveled to find out how far apart they are:
- So, \(180 + 90 = 270\) miles.

Therefore, the trains are 270 miles apart after 3 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We start by counting the days from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days, so that's 50 days in total.

Billy takes 20% of these days off, so he works 80% of the days. That means he works 40 days.

He works 3 hours each day, so he works for 120 hours in total.

Billy can help 2 people each hour, so he helps 240 people in total.

So, the number of people Billy helps is 240. The answer is 240."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. So, there were 12 buses and each bus had 35 people inside. That makes 12 times 35, which is 420 people in buses. Then there were 20 cars and each car had 3 people inside. That makes 20 times 3, which is 60 people in cars. If we add the people in the buses and the cars together, we get 420 plus 60, which is 480. So, 480 people were inside the church. The answer is 480."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mike is 24 years old. Martha is younger than Mike by 4 years, so Martha is 20 years old. Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff is 30 years old.

So, the answer is that Jeff is 30 years old."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have two slides. The big one is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet per minute. So, to find out how long it takes to go down the big slide, we divide the length by the speed: 300 feet / 60 feet per minute = 5 minutes.

The second slide is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet per minute. So, to find out how long it takes to go down the second slide, we divide the length by the speed: 240 feet / 80 feet per minute = 3 minutes.

Now, to find out how much longer it takes on the big slide, we subtract the time for the second slide from the time for the big slide: 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the big slide. The answer is 2 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 times 15 minutes for breaks each day. That's 30 minutes for lunch and 30 minutes for breaks, which makes 60 minutes in total for his lunch and breaks each day.

Now, if he does this for 5 days, we need to find out how many hours that is. If 60 minutes is the same as 1 hour, then 60 minutes times 5 days is 300 minutes. And if we divide 300 minutes by 60, we get 5 hours.

So, after 5 days, his lunch and break time adds up to 5 hours. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We know that Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 3.5 times 8, which is 28 miles. Now, the total distance they all ran together is 52 miles. If we add the miles Amber and Micah ran, that's 8 + 28 = 36 miles. So, to find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles Amber and Micah ran from the total, which is 52 - 36 = 16 miles. Therefore, Ahito ran 16 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Sheila started with $85.00 on her card. She gave back $15.00 because she didn't need the item anymore. So, she had $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00 left on her card.

Then, she bought a frying pan that was 20% off $20.00. So, the frying pan cost her 20% less, which is 20/100 * $20.00 = $4.00 less. So, the frying pan cost her $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. So, the towels cost her 10% less, which is 10/100 * $30.00 = $3.00 less. So, the towels cost her $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.

Now, she adds the cost of the frying pan and the towels to the $70.00 she had left on her card. So, $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

So, the new balance on her card is $113.00."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a jellyfish tank with jellyfish in it. The problem tells us that a fifth of the jellyfish are big and can change color to blue under UV light. It also says that a third of these big jellyfish will change color. When the UV light is on, 6 jellyfish change color. We need to find out how many jellyfish are in the tank.

To figure this out, we can set up a simple equation. If 6 jellyfish change color and they are a third of the big jellyfish, then the big jellyfish must be 6 times 3, which is 18. Since these 18 jellyfish are a fifth of the total jellyfish, we can say that 18 is a fifth of the total number of jellyfish. So, if we multiply 18 by 5, we get the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

\[ 18 \times 5 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We have Chris who is 4 years old. Ben is twice as old as Chris, so Ben is 8 years old. Caroline is three times as old as Ben, so Caroline is 24 years old. Therefore, Caroline is 24 years old. The answer is 24."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 salary each year. So, she saves $20,000 each year.

She wants to live with 40% of her current salary in retirement, which is $40,000 a year. She plans to do this for 20 years.

To find out how much she needs to save for 20 years, we multiply her yearly living expenses by 20:
\[ \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000 \]

Now, to find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we divide the total amount she needs by how much she saves each year:
\[ \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years} \]

So, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement. The answer is 40 years."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Marty has a ribbon that's 100 centimeters long. He wants to cut it into 4 equal pieces. So, each piece would be:

\[ \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{4} = 25 \text{ cm} \]

Now, each of these 25 cm pieces is going to be cut into 5 smaller pieces. So, each of these smaller pieces would be:

\[ \frac{25 \text{ cm}}{5} = 5 \text{ cm} \]

So, the length of each final cut will be 5 centimeters."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know that 40% of the school is boys and that number is 240. To find out the total number of students, we divide 240 by 0.40 because 40% is the same as 0.40 in numbers.

\[ 240 \div 0.40 = 600 \]

So, there are 600 students in total in the school.

Now, to find out how many girls there are, we know that 60% of the students are girls because if 40% are boys, the rest must be girls. We calculate 60% of 600:

\[ 600 \times 0.60 = 360 \]

So, there are 360 girls in the school.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

My mom bought pots that cost $19 and a sack of soil that cost $26. She had a coupon that said she could take off $7. So, first, I add the cost of the pots and the soil together. That's $19 plus $26, which makes $45. Then, I take off the $7 she got from the coupon. So, $45 minus $7 is $38.

So, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have three ladies wearing 4-inch heels and three ladies wearing 2-inch heels. To find the average height of the heels, we add up all the heels and then divide by the number of ladies.

First, we add up all the heels:
- 4 inches for each of the 3 ladies = 4 * 3 = 12 inches
- 2 inches for each of the 3 ladies = 2 * 3 = 6 inches

Now, we add these together:
- 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

There are 3 + 3 = 6 ladies in total. To find the average, we divide the total height of the heels by the number of ladies:
- 18 inches ÷ 6 ladies = 3 inches

So, the average height of the heels is 3 inches. The answer is 3 inches."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days. She plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, so that's 250 miles a day. To find out how many miles she needs to hike each day to reach her goal, we divide the total miles by the number of days in June. 

\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, she needs to hike 310 miles a day to reach her goal. But she's only planning to hike 250 miles a day. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we subtract the planned miles from the required miles.

\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles each day to reach her goal. The answer is 60 miles per day."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have different colors of balls and they cost different amounts. We need to find out how much money the store will get if they sell all the balls.

First, we have 3 red balls. Each red ball costs $9. So, if we multiply the number of red balls by the cost of each red ball, we get:
\[ 3 \times 9 = 27 \]
So, the store gets $27 from the red balls.

Next, we have 11 blue balls. Each blue ball costs $5. So, if we multiply the number of blue balls by the cost of each blue ball, we get:
\[ 11 \times 5 = 55 \]
So, the store gets $55 from the blue balls.

Then, we have 25 green balls. Each green ball costs $3. So, if we multiply the number of green balls by the cost of each green ball, we get:
\[ 25 \times 3 = 75 \]
So, the store gets $75 from the green balls.

Now, to find out the total money the store will get, we add up all the money from the red, blue, and green balls:
\[ 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 \]

So, the store will get $157 in total. The answer is \(\boxed{157}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Pierre and Paul together want 7 kg of apples. They bought 12 kg in total. So, the amount left for James is 12 kg minus 7 kg, which is 5 kg. So, James will have 5 kg of apples left. The answer is 5 kg."

We start with 2 degrees Celsius. Then it gets colder by 8 degrees, so we do 2 minus 8, which gives us -6 degrees. But then it gets warmer by 3 degrees, so we add 3 to -6, and that gives us -3 degrees.

So, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius."
"Raymond started with $21. Then he got $11 more from his allowance, so he had $21 + $11 = $32. But then he spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, which is $5 + $19 = $24 in total. So, he spent $24, and he had $32 - $24 = $8 left. 

So, the amount of money Raymond has left is $8. 

The answer is: **8**"
"Anna had $16 to start with and spent $4 on other things. So, she had $12 left for the books. She bought 2 books and had $2 left after buying the books, which means she spent $10 on the books. Since she bought 2 books for $10, each book cost her $5. So, the cost of each book is:

Last year, there were 50 students in the calligraphy class. This year, the number of students increased by 20%. To find out how many students there are this year, we need to add 20% of 50 to 50.

First, we calculate 20% of 50:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, we add 10 to the original 50 students:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, this year there are 60 students in the calligraphy class.

The final answer is 60."

We know the lighthouse light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes. That means it blinks 51 times in one minute. Now, we want to know how long it takes for the light to blink 459 times.

To find this out, we divide 459 by 51, which gives us 9. So, it takes 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.

The answer is: **9 minutes**"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tate starts with 4 male guppies and 7 female guppies. Then he gets 2 more male guppies and 1 more female guppy. So, he ends up with 4 + 2 = 6 male guppies and 7 + 1 = 8 female guppies.

He also starts with 3 male goldfishes and 5 female goldfishes. Then he gets 2 more male goldfishes and 3 more female goldfishes. So, he ends up with 3 + 2 = 5 male goldfishes and 5 + 3 = 8 female goldfishes.

Now, let's count all the fish:
- Male fish: 6 (guppies) + 5 (goldfishes) = 11
- Female fish: 8 (guppies) + 8 (goldfishes) = 16

To find out how many more female fish there are than male fish, we do:
16 (female fish) - 11 (male fish) = 5

So, Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish. The answer is 5."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Amalia mowed the lawn and that took her 4 hours. Megan had to walk the dog, and that took her 2 hours more than Amalia, so that's 4 hours plus 2 hours, which is 6 hours. Dior did laundry and that took her more than 4 hours, but we're told it took her 12 hours. So, to find out how long they all took together, we add up the time each one took:

- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 12 hours

If we add these up, we get 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 hours. So, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 22 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. John goes to visit his parents twice a month. It takes him 2 hours to drive one way, and he drives at a speed of 70 miles per hour. First, we find out how far he drives one way. If he drives for 2 hours at 70 miles per hour, he covers 140 miles one way. Since he goes there and back, that's a round trip, so he drives 140 miles twice, which is 280 miles in total for the month. So, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents. The answer is 280 miles."

Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. In 7 days, she'll walk:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Now, the problem says that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if we let the number of miles Brian walks be \( B \), then:
\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find out how many miles Brian walks, we divide 70 by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The toy factory got an order for 400 toys. They have 5 workers, and 4 of them work 10 hours a day. Two workers make 6 toys each hour, and the other two make 4 toys each hour. So, in 10 hours, these 4 workers make:
- The two who make 6 toys each hour make \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour, so in 10 hours, they make \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The two who make 4 toys each hour make \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour, so in 10 hours, they make \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.
- Together, these 4 workers make \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys in 10 hours.

The factory still needs 20 more toys to fill the order, so they need to make \(400 - 20 = 380\) toys in total. Since the 4 workers made 200 toys, the fifth worker must have made \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours. So, the fifth worker makes \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

The answer is that the fifth worker makes \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Kory has a dog that weighs 60 pounds. Now, Elijah's doggy is a bit smaller. One of Elijah's dogs is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, so that doggy weighs 60 pounds divided by 4, which is 15 pounds. Another doggy of Elijah's is half the weight of Kory's dog, so that doggy weighs 60 pounds divided by 2, which is 30 pounds.

So, Elijah's two dogs together weigh 15 pounds plus 30 pounds, which is 45 pounds.

Now, if we add Kory's doggy and Elijah's two dogs together, we get 60 pounds (Kory's dog) plus 45 pounds (Elijah's dogs), which makes 105 pounds.

So, the total weight of both dogs is 105 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. Then Luis gave half of what he got to Kris. Kris ended up with 9 stickers and 7 more were given to Rob, so Kris got 16 stickers in total.

If Kris got 16 stickers, that means Luis got 16 times 2 because Luis got all of Seth's half. So Luis got 32 stickers. And Seth gave Luis 32 stickers, so Seth had 64 stickers to start with.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning."
"John buys 3 large bags of M&Ms, and each bag weighs 10 ounces. So, the total weight of M&Ms is 30 ounces. If 1 ounce of M&Ms has 30 M&Ms, then 30 ounces will have 30 times 30 M&Ms, which is 900 M&Ms. If John puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag, then the number of small bags he can make is 900 divided by 10, which is 90. So, the answer is 90."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The Earth is like a big circle, and it's 40,000 kilometers all the way around. If we want to know half of that, we just divide 40,000 by 2, which gives us 20,000 kilometers. That's how far Alfie needs to fly to go halfway around the Earth.

Now, Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it takes him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide 20,000 by 400. That gives us 50 days.

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth. The answer is 50 days."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a car that's really fast, and we know it's 1.25 times faster than the car that's second fastest. The second fastest car is 5 times faster than the car that's just okay, which can go 120 miles per hour.

So, the second fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the second fastest car:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Two years ago, Liam was 14 years old. At that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, if we say Vince's age two years ago was \( V \), then we have:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we divide 14 by 2:

\[ V = 7 \]

So, two years ago, Vince was 7 years old. Now, we add those 2 years to Vince's age two years ago to find out how old he is now:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have four friends painting Easter eggs. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number, and Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. We know the total number of eggs painted is 56.

First, let's figure out how many eggs Sarah painted. If Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, we can say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs and Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs. So, \( S + (S + 12) = 30 \). This simplifies to \( 2S + 12 = 30 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( 2S = 18 \), so \( S = 9 \). This means Sarah painted 9 eggs.

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number and the total eggs painted by all four is 56, we can say \( 13 + 13 + 9 + (9 + 12) = 56 \). This works out because \( 13 + 13 + 9 + 21 = 56 \).

Now, to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, we see that Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 13 eggs. So, Camden painted \( 21 - 13 = 8 \) more eggs than Arnold.

The answer is: 8"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Nik has 200 crayons and he wants to put them in boxes with 8 crayons in each box. So, he can make 25 boxes. Each box weighs 8 ounces, so all the boxes together weigh 200 ounces. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so all the crayons together weigh 200 ounces too. When you add the weight of the crayons and the boxes, it's 400 ounces. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide 400 by 16 to get the weight in pounds. So, 400 divided by 16 is 25 pounds. The answer is 25 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. John has a big tree that's 80 feet long. He can make logs out of 80% of the tree, so he can make logs that are 64 feet long because 80 times 0.80 equals 64.

From these 64-foot logs, he cuts them into 4-foot logs. To find out how many 4-foot logs he gets, we divide 64 by 4, which gives us 16 logs.

Each of these 16 logs he cuts into 5 pieces, so he gets 16 times 5, which is 80 pieces.

Each piece he sells for $1.2, so to find out how much he makes, we multiply 80 by $1.2, which gives us $96.

So, John makes $96. The answer is $96."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Valerie earns $5000 a month. Her brother earns twice that, so he earns $10000 a month. Together, they earn $5000 + $10000 = $15000 a month.

Their mom earns twice what they earn together, so she earns $15000 x 2 = $30000 a month.

To find out how much money they all have together, we add up what Valerie, her brother, and their mom earn:
$5000 (Valerie) + $10000 (brother) + $30000 (mom) = $45000.

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000.

The answer is: $45000"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. She spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. The beach part is twice as long as the sidewalk part, so the sidewalk part must be half the time she spends on the beach. So, if she spends 40 minutes on the beach, she spends 40 / 2 = 20 minutes on the sidewalk. Now, to walk 2 miles on the beach at her speed, it takes her 40 minutes, so to walk 1 mile, it takes her 40 / 2 = 20 minutes. Adding the time she spends on the sidewalk, which is 20 minutes, we get 40 + 20 = 60 minutes. But we need to add the time for the 1 mile on the sidewalk, which is 20 minutes. So, the total time is 40 + 20 = 60 minutes. The answer is 60 minutes."
"Jane has been saving $4 every week for 8 weeks, so she has saved $32. She wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs, we subtract $32 from $60, which gives us $28. Since she saves $4 every week, we divide $28 by $4 to find out how many more weeks she needs to save. 

$28 ÷ $4 = 7 weeks.

So, it will take her 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The answer is 7 weeks."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. So that's 3 times 7, which is 21 blue birds.

Then we have 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. That's 2 times 4, which is 8 blue birds.

Lastly, we have 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, if we add all these up: 21 from the first set of trees, 8 from the second set, and 3 from the last tree, we get:

21 + 8 + 3 = 32

So, there are 32 blue birds in total."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Bob starts with some marbles. If he gets 24 more marbles (because 2 dozen is 24), he ends up with 60 marbles. So, if we take away the 24 marbles he got, he must have had 36 marbles to start with (60 - 24 = 36).

Now, if Bob loses 10 of those marbles, he'll have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left.

So, the number of marbles Bob will have is 26."
"Oh, okay. So Donny has two mugs of water. One is 33 degrees and the other is an unknown temperature. He mixes 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. He can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. So he mixes 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, that leaves him with 29 degrees in that mug. He also takes 1 ounce from the other mug, which is at least 172 degrees because that's the temperature he needs to make the average 40 degrees or more. So the other mug must be at least 172 degrees. That means the answer is 172."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easy to understand.

Melanie's dad starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens. Every day, 20 more cows and 10 more chickens come to the farm. We need to count how many days are in three weeks. Three weeks have 21 days.

So, in 21 days, 20 cows come every day, which means 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows come. Also, 10 chickens come every day, which means 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens come.

At first, there are 50 cows + 20 chickens = 70 animals. After 21 days, there will be 420 cows + 50 cows = 470 cows and 210 chickens + 20 chickens = 230 chickens.

So, the total number of animals will be 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00. So, 4 packs cost $40.00. But he gets a 10% discount on the total, which is $4.00. So, after the discount, he pays $36.00 for all the bagels.

Now, he gets 4 packs of bagels, and each pack has 9 bagels, so he gets 36 bagels in total. To find out how much each bagel costs, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels. So, $36.00 divided by 36 bagels equals $1.00 per bagel.

So, each single bagel costs $1.00. The answer is $1.00."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

First, we find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem says he ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we do 23 minus 5, which gives us 18 scoops.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are in 18 scoops. The problem tells us that 2 scoops of mashed potatoes need 3 less than 6 potatoes. So, 2 scoops need 6 minus 3, which is 3 potatoes.

Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are in 18 scoops. Since 2 scoops need 3 potatoes, we can think of it like this: if 2 scoops are 3 potatoes, then 18 scoops would be a bit more. We can set it up like this:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The answer is 27."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for the first 30 days. So, he eats:
\[ 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs} \]

Then, for the next 30 days, he eats 5 eggs a day. So, he eats:
\[ 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs} \]

Now, if we add the eggs from both periods, Chester eats:
\[ 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs} \]

Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs 240 eggs make:
\[ \frac{240 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20 \, \text{dozen} \]

So, Chester will need 20 dozen eggs for 60 days. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a big jar of jellybeans. Jess can see that there are 17 green ones. She also sees that there are twice as many red ones as green ones, so that means there are 34 red ones. Now, we know the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60.

To find out how many blue ones there are, we need to subtract the green and red ones from the total. So, we take 60 and subtract the 17 green ones and the 34 red ones. 

Let's do the math: 60 - 17 - 34 = 9.

So, there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar. The answer is 9."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tim grows 5 trees, and each year he gets 6 lemons from each tree. So, to find out how many lemons he gets in a year, we do this:

1. First, we find out how many lemons he gets from all his trees in one year. He gets 6 lemons from each tree, and he has 5 trees, so:
   \[
   6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ lemons per year}
   \]

2. Now, we want to know how many lemons he gets in 10 years, which is a decade. So we multiply the number of lemons he gets in one year by 10:
   \[
   30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ lemons in a decade}
   \]

So, Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade. The answer is 300."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know the bus has a ratio of men to women as 5:9, and the total number of people on the bus is 84. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. Together, they make 14 parts in total.

If we divide 84 by 14, we get 6. This means each part represents 6 people. So, 5 parts (for men) would be 5 times 6, which is 30 men, and 9 parts (for women) would be 9 times 6, which is 54 women.

Now, if 20 women get off the bus, we subtract 20 from 54. So, 54 minus 20 is 34.

Therefore, the number of women left on the bus is 34.

The answer is: **34**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Faraday sells sunflowers and bouquets. From selling sunflowers, he makes $26 in a day. Each sunflower costs $2, so he sells \(26 / 2 = 13\) sunflowers a day. He also sells bouquets, and from selling them, he makes $56 a day. Each bouquet costs $8, so he sells \(56 / 8 = 7\) bouquets a day. Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so from selling 7 bouquets, he gets \(7 \times 12 = 84\) sunflowers. Adding the sunflowers he sells on his own, he sells \(13 + 84 = 97\) sunflowers a day. Over 3 days, he sells \(97 \times 3 = 291\) sunflowers. So, the total number of sunflowers he sells in 3 days is 291."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Adam starts with $100. He buys rocks at $5 each. With $100, he can buy 20 rocks because 100 divided by 5 is 20.

Then, he sells 60% of these rocks. 60% of 20 is 12 rocks. He sells each rock for $7, so he gets 12 times 7, which is $84 from selling the rocks.

He started with $100 and spent $100 on rocks, so he has nothing left. But he got $84 from selling the rocks. So, he lost $16 because he spent $100 and got back $84.

So, the answer is that Adam loses $16."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. Lauren can draw different numbers of pictures in a day. She can draw 5 big pictures, 6 medium pictures, or 7 small pictures in one day.

For the big pictures, she needs to draw 45. If she draws 5 pictures a day, she'll need:
\[ \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ days} \]

For the medium pictures, she needs to draw 36. If she draws 6 pictures a day, she'll need:
\[ \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ days} \]

For the small pictures, she needs to draw 49. If she draws 7 pictures a day, she'll need:
\[ \frac{49}{7} = 7 \text{ days} \]

Now, to finish all the pictures, she needs to do all three types. So, we add the days:
\[ 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take her 22 days to finish all the pictures. The answer is 22 days."
"Chatty had three sets of twelve eggs for her kids' Easter fun. So, she had 36 eggs in total. She wants to share these eggs equally among her four kids. If she divides 36 eggs into 4 parts, each part would be 9 eggs. So, each child gets 9 eggs. The answer is 9."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

May has 31 days. Each of Jen's fish needs $1 worth of food every day. So, for 3 fish, it would cost $3 a day. Now, to find out how much she spends in May, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May.

$3 per day times 31 days equals $93.

So, Jen spends $93 on food in the month of May. The answer is $93."
"Oh, okay. So Patricia started with 30 roses. She gave 24 to her mom, so she had 6 left. Then she got 15 more roses. So she added those 15 to the 6 she had left. That makes 15 + 6 = 21 roses. So now she has 21 roses."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Sid first traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then he traveled 140 miles in 3 hours. So, in total, he traveled 250 miles. The time he took was 5 hours. To find out how fast he was going on average, we divide the total distance by the total time. So, 250 miles divided by 5 hours equals 50 miles per hour. Therefore, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour. The answer is 50."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mark has two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one, so it has a 60% chance of winning.

Now, we want to know the chance that both tickets win. To find this, we multiply the chances of each ticket winning:

- First ticket wins: 20% or 0.20
- Second ticket wins: 60% or 0.60

So, we do 0.20 times 0.60, which gives us 0.12. To change this to a percentage, we multiply by 100, so 0.12 times 100 is 12%.

Therefore, the chance that both tickets are winners is 12%."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. So, Jim collected 27 seashells. That's 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, if we take away those 5, we find out Carlos collected 22 seashells. Now, Jim and Carlos together collected 27 + 22 = 49 seashells. Carrey collected half as many as Carlos, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells. So, in total, they collected 49 + 11 = 60 seashells. They shared these equally, so each person got 60 / 3 = 20 seashells. So, each person got 20 seashells."
"Okay, let me think about this. Mason eats carrots on weekdays and on weekends. On weekdays, he eats 4 carrots each day, and there are 5 weekdays. So, that's 4 carrots/day times 5 days, which is 20 carrots. On weekends, he eats 5 carrots each day, and there are 2 days in the weekend. So, that's 5 carrots/day times 2 days, which is 10 carrots. If we add the carrots he eats on weekdays and the carrots he eats on weekends, we get 20 carrots plus 10 carrots, which is 30 carrots. So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week. The answer is 30."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John has a cassette with two songs. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is longer, but we don't know how much longer right away. But we know it's 60% longer than the first song.

To find out how much longer the second song is, we take 60% of 5 minutes. That's 3 minutes. So, the second song is 5 minutes plus 3 minutes, which makes it 8 minutes long.

Now, to find the total time of the cassette, we add the time of the first song and the second song together. So, 5 minutes plus 8 minutes equals 13 minutes.

So, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Linus buys mobile devices for $20 each. He sells each one for twice that, so he sells them for $40 each.

Last Monday, he bought 2 devices, so the cost was 2 times $20, which is $40.
Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices, so the cost was 4 times $20, which is $80.

So, the total cost for all the devices he bought is $40 + $80 = $120.

He sold all the devices for $40 each. He sold 2 + 4 = 6 devices, so he made 6 times $40, which is $240.

To find out how much profit he made, we subtract the total cost from the total money he made: $240 - $120 = $120.

So, the profit he made is $120. The answer is $120."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Isabel is 7 feet tall. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 5 feet tall. Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 6 feet tall.

Now, Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, if Carl is 6 feet tall, his cane would be 6 divided by 2, which is 3 feet long.

So, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To figure out how many more bottles Hortex needs to make, we first need to know how many bottles are needed for 2300 people. Each person needs 5 bottles because 20% of a bottle covers 20% of their daily energy need, so 5 bottles cover 100%.

Now, we multiply the number of people by the number of bottles each person needs:
\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex can make 4200 bottles a day. To find out how many more bottles they need to make, we subtract the number they can make from the number they need:
\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Hortex needs to make 7300 more bottles to meet the needs of 2300 people. The answer is 7300 bottles."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Carla had 8 babies. She dressed 3 out of 4 babies in purple and 1 out of 4 in blue. So, 6 babies are in purple clothes and 2 babies are in blue clothes.

Now, 1 out of the 2 babies in blue clothes also wears a bow. And 1 out of 3 of the babies in purple clothes also wears a bow. So, that means 2 babies in purple clothes wear bows.

To find out the chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we look at the total number of babies wearing bows (which is 3) and how many of those are in purple clothes (which is 2).

So, the chance is 2 out of 3, which is about 66.67%.

The answer is: 66.67%"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Last week, the IRS got a big pile of tax reports. They got 5168 reports in total. On Monday and Tuesday, they got 1907 reports. On Thursday and Friday, they got 2136 reports. Now, we need to find out how many reports they got on Wednesday.

To do this, we take the total number of reports and subtract the reports from Monday and Tuesday, and the reports from Thursday and Friday. So, we do:

\[ 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

First, we add the reports from Monday and Tuesday and Thursday and Friday:

\[ 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \]

Now, we take the total reports and subtract the 4043:

\[ 5168 - 4043 = 1125 \]

So, the IRS got 1125 reports on Wednesday. The answer is 1125."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Abraham has 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it, which is 40 square meters, for $50. So, he got $50 for 40 square meters, which means he got $1.25 for each square meter.

Then, he sold another 1/4 of his land, which is 20 square meters, for $30. So, he got $30 for 20 square meters, which means he got $1.50 for each square meter.

After that, he had 20 square meters left, and he sold them for $3 each.

So, the money he got from selling the first half is $50.
The money he got from selling the second half is $30.
The money he got from selling the last half is 20 square meters * $3 per square meter = $60.

Now, if we add all this up, $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

So, Abraham will earn $140 in total."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We know Haley is 26 years old. Geb is 10 years less than half of Haley's age. So, we first find half of Haley's age, which is 26 divided by 2, that gives us 13. Then we take 10 years off that, so 13 minus 10 is 3. Therefore, Geb is 3 years old."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tyrion goes out three times a day and changes his mask two times each time he goes out. So, that means he uses 2 masks for each time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, he uses 2 times 3, which is 6 masks a day.

Now, we want to know how many masks he uses in 2 days. If he uses 6 masks in one day, then in 2 days he would use 6 times 2, which is 12 masks.

So, the answer is 12 masks in 2 days."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 times 12, so that's 36 eggs. Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so that's 10 minus 2, which is 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, so that's 8 divided by 2, which is 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs they found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

So, the number of eggs still hidden is 36 minus 27, which is 9 eggs.

So, the answer is 9 eggs still hidden in the yard."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. John has to collect garbage from three apartment complexes. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments, so that's 200 + 200 = 400 apartments. The third complex has 60% more apartments than the first two combined, which means it has 400 * 0.60 = 240 more apartments. So, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, John goes to collect garbage 3 times a week from each of the three complexes. So, he goes 3 times a week * 3 complexes = 9 times a week. If he goes 9 times a week and each time he collects garbage from 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments, then he collects 1040 apartments * 9 times = 9360 apartments a week.

He gets paid $0.40 for each apartment he collects garbage from. So, his total pay for the week is 9360 apartments * $0.40 = $3744.

So, the money John makes in a week is $3744."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine we have a tree that grows fruits. A 5-year-old tree gives us 50 fruits. A 6-year-old tree gives us 3 times that, so it's 150 fruits. A 7-year-old tree gives us 7 times the 50 fruits, so that's 350 fruits. An 8-year-old tree gives us 200 less than a 10-year-old tree, and a 10-year-old tree gives us 20 times the 50 fruits, so that's 1000 fruits. But the 9-year-old tree doesn't give us any fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits:
- 50 from the 5-year-old
- 150 from the 6-year-old
- 350 from the 7-year-old
- 300 from the 8-year-old
- 0 from the 9-year-old
- 1000 from the 10-year-old

So, we add them up: 50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850 fruits.

The total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is 1850."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Sophia had $100 and she gave Jack 1/5 of that, which is $20. Jack originally had $100, so after getting $20 from Sophia, he now has $120. So, the final amount of money Jack has is $120."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have three ropes, and we know some things about them:

1. The red rope is four times as long as the blue rope.
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
3. If we add up the lengths of all three ropes, it comes to 37 centimeters.

First, let's say the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long because if we take 7 off that, we get 5 for the blue rope, and 4 times 5 is 20 for the red rope. So, 12 (yellow) + 5 (blue) + 20 (red) equals 37, which matches the total length.

So, the red rope is 20 centimeters long. The answer is 20."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Ronnie got $5 and Rissa got three times that, so Rissa got $15. They both gave the same amount, $3, to their sister. After giving $3, Rissa has 4/5 of her money left, which checks out because $15 - $3 = $12, and $12 is 4/5 of $15. So, Ronnie also has $3 left because he gave away $3 too. The amount left in Ronnie's money is $2."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a mural that uses 12 pints of paint in total. The mural has four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. The red, white, and purple paints are the same amount, and half the mural is yellow.

So, if half the mural is yellow, that means 6 pints are yellow because half of 12 is 6.

Now, we know the red, white, and purple paints are equal, and together with the yellow paint, they make up the whole mural. So, if we add up the yellow paint (6 pints) and the red, white, and purple paints (which are the same amount), we get:

\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

To find out how much red paint there is, we solve for \( R \):

\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints. The answer is 2 pints."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. Tom has 4 bedrooms, and each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet. So, if we multiply 20 by 12, we get 240 square feet for each bedroom. Since he has 4 bedrooms, we multiply 240 by 4, which gives us 960 square feet for all the bedrooms.

Now, the living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom. So, if one bedroom is 240 square feet, the living room is 5 times that, which is 1200 square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

To find the total area of the house, we add up all these areas: 960 (bedrooms) + 1200 (living room) + 1000 (rest of the house) = 3160 square feet.

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"Oh, okay! Let me count it out for you. On Monday, Alice sees 3 puffs of clouds. On Tuesday, she sees double that, so that's 6 puffs. On Wednesday, she sees double the Tuesday count, so that's 12 puffs. On Thursday, she sees double the Wednesday count, so that's 24 puffs. On Friday, she sees double the Thursday count, so that's 48 puffs.

Now, let's add them all up: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48. 

3 + 6 is 9.
9 + 12 is 21.
21 + 24 is 45.
45 + 48 is 93.

So, at the end of the week, Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds in the sky at lunch across all five days. The answer is 93."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a special box that costs $12 and it has 20% more pods than the normal box. The normal box has 100 pods. So, the special box has 120 pods because 100 plus 20 more pods is 120.

Now, if we want to know how many times we can wash dishes with $1, we need to figure out how much one pod costs. The special box costs $12 for 120 pods, so one pod costs $12 divided by 120, which is $0.10 per pod.

If we have $1, and each pod costs $0.10, we can wash dishes 10 times because $1 divided by $0.10 is 10.

So, the answer is 10 times."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Thomas goes to the bank and gets $1000 in $20 bills. He gets 50 bills because 1000 divided by 20 is 50.

Then he loses 10 bills on the way home. So he has 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.

He then spends half of those, so he spends 40 / 2 = 20 bills. Now he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.

He triples the money, so he has 20 * 20 = 400 dollars. That's because each bill is $20.

Then he makes that into $5 bills. 400 dollars is 400 / 5 = 80 $5 bills.

So, Thomas ends up with 80 $5 bills."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. In the first half, Team A scored 4 goals and Team B scored 2 goals less, so that's 2 goals for Team B. In the second half, Team B scored 4 times what they scored in the first half, so that's 4 times 2, which is 8 goals. Team A scored 1/4 of what Team B scored in the second half, so that's 1/4 of 8, which is 2 goals. So, in total, Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and Team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals. Adding those up, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16. So, the answer is 16."
"Oh, hello there! Let me explain this to you in a simpler way, okay?

So, the teacher starts with a big piece of chalk that's 5 inches long. On Monday, he uses up 45% of it, which is 2.25 inches. So, he has 2.75 inches left.

Now, every day, he uses 20% of what's left. Let's see how much chalk he has left each day:

- On Tuesday, he uses 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 0.55 inches. So, he has 2.20 inches left.
- On Wednesday, he uses 20% of 2.20 inches, which is 0.44 inches. So, he has 1.76 inches left.
- On Thursday, he uses 20% of 1.76 inches, which is 0.35 inches. So, he has 1.40 inches left.
- On Friday, he uses 20% of 1.40 inches, which is 0.28 inches. So, he has 1.12 inches left.
- On Saturday, he uses 20% of 1.12 inches, which is 0.22 inches. So, he has 0.90 inches left.
- On Sunday, he uses 20% of 0.90 inches, which is 0.18 inches. So, he has 0.72 inches left.

Now, he can't write with a piece of chalk that's less than 2 inches, so he doesn't recycle any chalk yet. He keeps using it every day until it's less than 2 inches.

Let's see how many days it takes for the chalk to be less than 2 inches:

- Monday: 2.75 inches
- Tuesday: 2.20 inches
- Wednesday: 1.76 inches
- Thursday: 1.40 inches
- Friday: 1.12 inches
- Saturday: 0.90 inches
- Sunday: 0.72 inches

Oh, wait! On Sunday, he has 0.72 inches left, which is still more than 2 inches. So, he keeps using it until it's less than 2 inches. He uses it for 7 more days:

- Monday of next week: 0.72 inches left
- Tuesday of next week: 0.57 inches left
- Wednesday of next week: 0.46 inches left
- Thursday of next week: 0.37 inches left
- Friday of next week: 0.29 inches left
- Saturday of next week: 0.24 inches left
- Sunday of next week: 0.18 inches left

Oh no! He can't write with a piece of chalk that's less than 2 inches, so he has to recycle it. That means he has to recycle it after 7 days.

So, the answer is 7 days."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls. Now, one-third of the girls are on varsity, so that's 12 girls divided by 3, which is 4 girls. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so that's 12 boys divided by 4, which is 3 boys.

So, 4 girls and 3 boys are on varsity. That means 12 girls minus 4 girls equals 8 girls not on varsity, and 12 boys minus 3 boys equals 9 boys not on varsity.

Now, to find out how many students are not on varsity, we add the girls not on varsity to the boys not on varsity: 8 girls plus 9 boys equals 17 students.

So, the number of students not on varsity is 17."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Mike bought 5 face masks. Now, Johnny bought 2 more than three times what Mike bought. So, we first find out what three times 5 is, which is 15. Then we add 2 to 15, which gives us 17. So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The answer is 17."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

James has 30 teeth. His dentist does two things:
1. Drills 4 teeth.
2. Caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so that's 4 + 7 = 11 teeth.

So, the dentist fixes 4 teeth by drilling and 11 teeth by capping. That's a total of 4 + 11 = 15 teeth fixed.

Now, to find out what percentage of his teeth this is, we do this:
- Total teeth is 30.
- Teeth fixed is 15.
- So, we calculate (15 / 30) * 100 = 50%.

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth. The answer is 50%."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way.

Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk from the company. Each gallon cost $3.5. So, the total cost was 4000 gallons times $3.5 per gallon, which equals $14,000.

But then, he found out that 2/5 of the milk had gone bad and couldn't be sold. So, he had to return 2/5 of 4000 gallons, which is 1600 gallons.

The company gave him a refund for the 1600 gallons he returned. Since each gallon cost $3.5, the refund amount was 1600 gallons times $3.5 per gallon, which equals $5600.

So, Mr. Marcellus got $5600 back from the company. The answer is $5600."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have two people, Wendy and Colin. The problem tells us two things:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be in seven years.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

To find out how old Colin is now, we can think through it step by step.

First, let's say Colin is 20 years old now. If we add 7 years to Colin's age, he will be 27 years old. Wendy is five times as old as 27, so Wendy is 135 years old now.

Now, if we add 25 years to Colin's age, he will be 45 years old. And if we look at Wendy's age now, which is 135, and divide it by 3, we get 45. This matches what the problem said.

So, Colin is 20 years old now. That's my answer."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Bob has $27,000 to buy books. He can buy 100 books for $500. So, to find out how many books he can buy with $27,000, we divide $27,000 by $500 to see how many times he can buy $500 worth of books. 

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means he can buy 54 sets of 100 books. So, he can buy:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \text{ books in total.} \]

Now, he wants to share these books equally among 3 schools. So, we divide the total number of books by 3:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

So, each school gets 1800 books. 

The answer is: 1800 books per school."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, we start with two apples. One apple falls on Newton's head, and he picks it up. He puts one in his pocket and throws the other one back into the tree. This makes five more apples fall out of the tree. Now he has two apples in his pocket.

Then, he picks up the remaining apple and throws it back into the tree. This makes six more apples fall out of the tree. Now he has three apples in his pocket.

He picks up all the apples that fell out of the tree, and he has nine apples in total.

So, the number of apples Newton brought home is 9."
"To find out how much Ali's order costs, we first need to figure out how many 50 kg bags are in 850 kg of coal. We do this by dividing 850 by 50, which gives us 17 bags. Now, we know each bag costs $18. So, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag: 17 bags times $18 per bag equals $306. Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is $306. 

The answer is: $306"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Kate has 6 friends, and each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza. First, we find out how many cheese pizzas Kate needs. If each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and each friend eats 6 slices, then:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ slices per friend} \times 6 \text{ friends}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} \]

Next, we do the same for the pepperoni pizza. Each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, and each friend eats 4 slices, so:

\[ \frac{4 \text{ slices per friend} \times 6 \text{ friends}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} \]

So, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. That makes a total of:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is 6. The answer is:

**6**"
"Oh, okay. So Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That's 3 miles for each of those 3 days, so that's 3 times 3, which is 9 miles. Then on Tuesday and Thursday, he ran 5 miles each day, so that's 5 times 2, which is 10 miles. Now, if we add the miles from Monday to Friday, we get 9 miles plus 10 miles, which is 19 miles. So, Sam ran 19 miles this week."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 of them melt every 15 minutes. So, in one hour, he actually makes:
- 20 snowballs
- But 2 melt every 15 minutes, so 2 melted in the first 15 minutes, and 2 more melted in the next 15 minutes, making 4 melt in an hour.

So, in one hour, he ends up with:
- 20 - 4 = 16 snowballs.

Now, to get 60 snowballs, we need to figure out how many hours it takes:
- If he makes 16 snowballs in an hour, we divide 60 by 16 to find out how many hours it takes.
- 60 ÷ 16 = 3.75 hours.

So, it will take Jay 3.75 hours to have 60 snowballs. The closest answer from the options given would be 4 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. So, when the show first came out, John was 28 years old and he was twice as old as Jim. That means Jim was half of that, which is 14 years old at that time.

Now, the question is asking how old Jim is now. Since no time has passed and the problem doesn't say anything about Jim getting older, we can assume Jim is still 14 years old.

So, the answer is 14."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Doxa cut an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 piece. Her sister ate 1 more piece than Doxa, so that's 2 pieces. Her brother ate 1 more piece than her sister, so that's 3 pieces.

Now, let's count how many pieces they ate in total:
- Doxa ate 1 piece.
- Her sister ate 2 pieces.
- Her brother ate 3 pieces.

If we add these up: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 pieces.

So, they ate 6 pieces of apple in total. The answer is 6."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and got a new pack of 50. So, they had 12 bandages left from the first day and then got 50 more, making it 62 bandages.

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so that's 28 bandages. After using 28, they had 34 bandages left.

On the third day, they got two packs of 50 bandages each, so that's 100 bandages. But they only used half a pack, which is 25 bandages. So, they had 62 (from the end of the second day) + 100 (from the third day) - 25 (used) = 137 bandages.

But we know they ended up with 78 bandages at the end of the third day. So, they must have used 3 more bandages than they needed to reach 78. This means they started with 62 bandages on the first day.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

May's hair was originally 10 inches long and she ended up with 8 inches left. So, she had her hair cut by 2 inches. The cost to cut her hair is $30 for each inch. So, for 2 inches, it would cost her 2 times $30, which is $60.

The color of her hair costs $40. So, we add the cost of the haircut and the color together: $60 (for the haircut) + $40 (for the color) = $100.

So, the total cost for May's haircut and color is $100."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jen works 7.5 hours a day and she does this for 6 days a week. So, if we add up all the hours she works in a week, it's 7.5 hours/day * 6 days/week = 45 hours/week. Her hourly rate is $1.5, so her weekly pay is 45 hours/week * $1.5/hour = $67.50/week.

Since April has 4 weeks, we multiply her weekly pay by 4 weeks: $67.50/week * 4 weeks = $270.00.

But she also gets an extra $10 for every week she doesn't miss a day. Since April has 4 weeks, she gets $10/week * 4 weeks = $40.00 extra.

So, her total pay for April is $270.00 + $40.00 = $310.00.

The final amount Jen will receive is $310.00."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jason does his laundry once, so that's $3.00.
He cleans his room once, so that's $1.50.
He takes the trash out twice, so that's $0.75 times 2, which is $1.50.
He empties the dishwasher 6 times, so that's $0.50 times 6, which is $3.00.

Now, if we add all these up:
$3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (cleaning room) + $1.50 (taking trash) + $3.00 (emptying dishwasher) = $9.00.

So, Jason earned $9.00 in two weeks."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Brady learned that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. Now, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. So, if a whale has 40 gallons, a shark has 40 times 3, which is 120 gallons of blood.

Now, if we have ten sharks swimming in the sea, we need to find out how much blood they have together. So, we take the amount of blood one shark has, which is 120 gallons, and multiply it by 10. That gives us 1200 gallons.

So, ten sharks have 1200 gallons of blood in total. The answer is 1200 gallons."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

On that day, people came into the restaurant in different times. First, 50 people came in the morning. Then, at 10:00, 40 more people came in. That's 50 + 40 = 90 people so far. After that, twice as many people as those who came in at 10:00 came in later, which is 2 times 40, so that's 80 more people. Now we have 90 + 80 = 170 people. Finally, by evening, 3 times as many people as the first 50 came in, which is 3 times 50, so that's 150 more people. Adding these 150 to the 170 we have, we get 170 + 150 = 320 people in total.

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320. 

If I had to pick from the options given, the answer would be:

**320**"
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens, so that's 25 red pens. She also bought twice as many packs of black pens as red pens, so that's 10 packs of black pens. Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, so that's 50 black pens. If we add the red pens and the black pens together, we get 25 red pens + 50 black pens = 75 pens in total. So, Alain has 75 pens. The answer is 75."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. So, each bottle of scotch costs $60.

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he buys 20 bottles of cognac. The cognac costs 50% more than the scotch, so each bottle of cognac costs $60 times 1.5, which is $90.

Now, to find out how much he spends on the cognac, we multiply the number of bottles by the cost per bottle: 20 bottles times $90 per bottle equals $1800.

So, the total amount he spends is the cost of the scotch plus the cost of the cognac: $600 plus $1800 equals $2400.

So, the total amount John spends is $2400."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day. On the same day, he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees, so that's 40 trees.

On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than the first day, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees. He also planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than the first day, so that's 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.

So, in total, he planted 20 + 30 = 50 White Oak trees over the two days. And he planted 40 + 50 = 90 Lodgepole Pine trees over the two days.

Adding these up, he planted 50 + 90 = 140 trees in total.

So, the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted is 140."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. But his kids drank 4 gallons, so he had 20 gallons left. Then his wife spilled 7 gallons, so he had 13 gallons left. Then his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so he had 8 gallons left.

On the last day, 3 people came to the party, and they shared the 8 gallons of root beer equally. So, each person got 8 divided by 3 gallons of root beer.

8 divided by 3 is a bit more than 2 but less than 3. If we count it, it's about 2.67 gallons.

So, each person could drink about 2.67 gallons of root beer. 

If we had to pick from the options given, the closest answer would be about 2.67 gallons, but since we're not given options, the exact amount is 8/3 gallons.

So, the answer is 8/3 gallons."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a problem where we need to find out how many coffee mugs are in the teacher's lounge. The problem tells us that if we take four times the number of coffee mugs and then add eight, we get forty.

So, if we let the number of coffee mugs be \( x \), the equation becomes:
\[ 4x + 8 = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 4x = 40 - 8 \]
\[ 4x = 32 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ x = \frac{32}{4} \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have 66 fish in the tank. One-third of them have red stripes. So, we calculate one-third of 66:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Now, we subtract the 22 fish with red stripes from the total:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

These 44 fish are left. Out of these 44 fish, 5 out of every 11 have blue stripes. So, we calculate 5/11 of 44:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Now, to find out how many fish have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of red-striped fish and blue-striped fish:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

So, 42 fish have either red or blue stripes. The answer is 42."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Amy starts with two palettes, each with 4 colors, so that's 8 colors. Then she has three makeup sets, each with 6 colors, so that's 18 colors. So in total, she has 26 colors.

Then her sister takes one palette, which has 4 colors, so now she has 22 colors left.

Amy then uses half of one makeup set, which has 6 colors, so she uses 3 colors. That leaves her with 22 - 3 = 19 colors.

So, Amy has 19 colors left."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Mattison is 60 inches tall. His house is 7 times that height, so the house is 420 inches tall. The first floor of the house is 3 times Mattison's height, which means it's 180 inches high. So, the second floor, which is the rest of the house, is 420 - 180 = 240 inches high. That's how high the roof is from the floor of the second story. So, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We had 700 shells in total. Team Alphas found 40% of them. So, we calculate 40% of 700:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]

So, team Alphas found 280 shells. Now we have:

\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]

shells left. Team The finders then found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 420 = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]

So, team The finders found 252 shells. Now we have:

\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]

shells left. These are the shells that team Gogetters found.

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells. The answer is 168."
"Okay, let me think this through. We have four dogs and we know the total average distance they walk per day is 3 miles. The first dog walks 1 mile, the second dog walks 4 miles, and the third dog walks 3 miles. So, we can add up what we know:

1 mile (first dog) + 4 miles (second dog) + 3 miles (third dog) = 8 miles.

Since the average is 3 miles per dog and there are 4 dogs, the total distance they should walk is 3 miles/dog * 4 dogs = 12 miles. We already know they walk 8 miles together, so the last dog must walk the rest to make the total 12 miles. 

So, the last dog needs to walk:

12 miles (total) - 8 miles (known distances) = 4 miles.

The last dog needs to walk 4 miles. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan that's 40% of that, so he gets $100,000 in loan money. He uses 60% of that loan to pay off his debts. So, he uses $60,000 to pay off his debts.

Now, to find out how much he has left, we take the loan amount and subtract what he used to pay off his debts. So, $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000.

So, the money he has leftover is $40,000."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Deandre caught three big fish. The first one was 56 kilograms, the second one was 46 kilograms, and the third one was 26 kilograms. So, if we add all these up, we get:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, we know that each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. So, to find out how much money Deandre will get, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \times 0.50 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Deandre will earn 64 dollars. The answer is 64 dollars."

Trinity buys magazines for $72. She sells them for 11/8 of that price. So, she sells them for:

\[ \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 99 \]

This means she sells each magazine for $99. Now, to find out how much profit she makes, we subtract the cost from the selling price:

\[ 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity makes a profit of $27. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easy to understand.

Brian bought a dehumidifier to make his basement less wet. He tested it and found out how much water it can take out of the air at different speeds.

- At the low speed, it takes out 1 liter of water each day.
- At the medium speed, it takes out twice as much as the low speed, so that's 2 liters of water each day.
- At the high speed, it takes out twice as much as the medium speed, so that's 4 liters of water each day.

Brian used the dehumidifier for 3 days at the low speed, 3 days at the medium speed, and 5 days at the high speed. 

First, we calculate how much water it took out at each speed:
- For the low speed: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.
- For the medium speed: 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.
- For the high speed: 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total:
3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.

So, the dehumidifier took out 29 liters of water from the air in Brian's basement. The answer is 29 liters."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Jolene and her friends got 10 packs of balloons, and each pack had 30 balloons. So, they had 10 times 30 balloons, which is 300 balloons in total.

But by the end of the day, they had 12 balloons left. So, they must have thrown away the rest.

To find out how many they threw, we take the total number of balloons and subtract the ones that were left:

300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons.

So, they threw 288 balloons. The answer is 288."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

First, we need to find out how much medicine is in one dose. We know that for one dose, we use 14 mL of the first medicine and 3 times that amount of the second medicine. So, the second medicine is 3 times 14 mL, which is 42 mL. Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total for one dose: 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL.

Now, we want to know how much medicine is in 8 doses. So, we take the amount in one dose (56 mL) and multiply it by 8: 56 mL × 8 = 448 mL.

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL. The answer is 448 mL."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ali's class can have 120 students. John has two classes, and each of John's classes can have 1/8 of Ali's class. So, 1/8 of 120 is 15 students in each of John's classes. Since John has two classes, that makes 15 times 2, which is 30 students in total for John's classes.

Now, Ali's class and John's classes together can have 120 plus 30 students, which is 150 students.

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students. The answer is 150."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to give her back $306 because he has to add 2% interest. That's $300 plus $6 for the interest.

Now, Stephen is going to pay his sister $25 every month for 11 months. So, he'll pay her $25 x 11 = $275 in total for the first 11 months.

Since he has to give her back $306 in total, and he's already paid $275, he'll have to pay the rest in the last month. So, he'll pay $306 - $275 = $31 in the last month.

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is $31."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Jordan has two kids, and each kid needs 5 diapers changed every day. So, that's 10 diapers in total for both kids. Jordan's wife takes care of half of the diapers, so she changes 5 diapers. That means the other half, which is also 5 diapers, must be changed by Jordan. So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day. The answer is 5 diapers."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

First, we find out how big the jar is. The jar is a square box with sides of 6 inches and a height of 15 inches. To find the total space in the jar, we multiply the length of one side by itself (6 inches x 6 inches) and then by the height (15 inches). So, 6 x 6 x 15 equals 540 cubic inches.

Next, we think about how well the jelly beans fit inside. We know they don't fill up the jar perfectly, so we use 80% to figure out how much space they actually take up. So, 540 x 0.80 equals 432 cubic inches.

Now, we know each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches. To find out how many jelly beans can fit in the jar, we divide the total space the jelly beans can use (432 cubic inches) by the space one jelly bean takes (0.15 cubic inches). So, 432 / 0.15 equals 2880 jelly beans.

Tim thinks 30% of these jelly beans are red. So, we find 30% of 2880, which is 2880 x 0.30 = 864 red jelly beans.

But we know the real number of red jelly beans is 900. To find out how far off Tim was, we subtract his guess from the real number: 900 - 864 = 36.

So, Tim was 36 jelly beans off. The answer is 36."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The bus starts with 20 people. Then 40 more people get on, so now there are 20 + 40 = 60 people on the bus. At the next stop, 30 more people get on, making the total 60 + 30 = 90 people. At the third stop, the number of people doubles, so there are 90 x 2 = 180 people on the bus now. The bus can hold 200 people, so to fill the rest, we need 200 - 180 = 20 more people.

So, the number of people needed to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Pauline goes to the museum three times a year. For the first 5 years, each visit costs $2. So, for 5 years, she spends:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} \times \$2/\text{visit} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

After 5 years, the cost of each visit goes up by 150%. That means it becomes:
\[ \$2 + 1.5 \times \$2 = \$2 + \$3 = \$5 \]

For the next 3 years, she goes to the museum 3 times a year, so she spends:
\[ 3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} \times \$5/\text{visit} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much she spent in total, we add the two amounts together:
\[ \$30 + \$45 = \$75 \]

So, Pauline spent a total of \$75 on all her visits to the museum. The answer is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Cedar Falls Middle School has students in grades 4 to 7. They want to see who gets the most points in a special reading game. The top 10 students in each grade get to play a fun game where they try to escape a room set up by the teachers. But only 8 students can play at once. They have 45 minutes to try and escape.

Now, there are 3 grades, and each grade has 10 students, so that's 30 students in total. But only 8 can play at once, so we need to figure out how many groups of 8 we can make from 30 students. We can make 3 full groups of 8, and we'll have 6 students left over. So, we need 4 groups in total.

Each group gets 45 minutes, and we have 4 groups, so we multiply 45 minutes by 4. That gives us 180 minutes.

So, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room. That's the same as 3 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. John made 4 tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each for Ali. For the tables, 4 times 20 is 80. For the roof frames, 2 times 10 is 20. So, 80 plus 20 is 100. That means Ali has to pay John 100 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ian has a big board that's 40 feet long. He wants to cut it into two pieces. The longer piece is supposed to be 4 times as long as the shorter piece.

So, if we call the shorter piece \( x \) feet, then the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet. The total length of the board is the sum of these two pieces, which is 40 feet. So we can write it like this:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find out what \( x \) is, we divide 40 by 5:

\[ x = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. Now, the longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece, so:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The answer is: 32 feet."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs, and he knows he needs 16 meatballs from each pound of meat. So, to get 80 meatballs, he needs 5 pounds of meat because 80 divided by 16 is 5.

Now, Aiden also knows he needs 2 tablespoons of his special seasoning for every pound of meat. So, for 5 pounds of meat, he needs 5 times 2 tablespoons of seasoning. That means he needs 10 tablespoons of seasoning.

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his special seasoning. The answer is 10 tablespoons."
"Luke has five windows, and each window is 35 inches wide. So, all the windows together are 175 inches wide. He needs to buy fabric that is twice the total width of the windows. So, he needs to buy 2 times 175 inches, which is 350 inches. Therefore, the amount of fabric Luke should buy is 350 inches. The answer is 350 inches."
"To figure out the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the rest.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, we calculate:
\[ 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

After 16 minutes, the price drops to $0.2 per minute. So, for the next 20 minutes, the cost is:
\[ 20 \times 0.2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the two parts together to get the total cost:
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

On Monday, it rained 2 inches. Now, for Tuesday, it's supposed to rain 1 inch more than twice what it rained on Monday. So, we first find out what twice Monday's rain is. That would be 2 inches times 2, which is 4 inches. Then, we add 1 more inch to that, so it's 4 inches plus 1 inch, which makes 5 inches.

So, on Tuesday, it will rain 5 inches."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Carly makes cupcakes and brownies for her class. She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. There are 5 people in her class, and each person gets 2 treats. So, in total, they get 10 treats.

If we say she made 3 cupcakes, then she makes 3 times 3, which is 9, and then takes away 2, so she makes 7 brownies. Adding the cupcakes and brownies together, 3 cupcakes plus 7 brownies equals 10 treats.

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

First, a basic manicure costs $35 and a pedicure costs $40. So, if Karen gets both, the total cost without any discount is $35 + $40 = $75.

The salon gives a 20% discount if you get both services. So, 20% of $75 is $75 * 0.20 = $15. That means the discount is $15.

So, after the discount, the cost is $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, Karen wants to add nail art to each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers, and each nail art costs $3. So, the total cost for nail art is 10 * $3 = $30.

Adding the discounted cost of the services and the nail art, the total cost is $60 + $30 = $90.

So, Karen would pay $90 in all."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Susan gets magazines that send out different numbers of issues each year. She gets 3 magazines that send 12 issues each year, so that's 3 times 12, which is 36 issues. She also gets 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. And she gets another magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine, so that's 4 times 6, which is 24 issues.

Now, if we add all these up: 36 issues from the first 3 magazines, 6 issues from the second magazine, and 24 issues from the third magazine, we get 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 issues.

Since each issue is from a different magazine, she gets 66 magazines every year. So, the answer is 66 magazines."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We know Samantha has 27 paintings, and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to 27, we get the number of paintings Shelley has. That would be 39 paintings. Now, Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, if we take away 8 from Shelley's paintings, we get the number of paintings Kim has. That would be 31 paintings. So, Kim has 31 paintings."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

In November, the toy costs $40. In December, it gets more expensive by 80%. So, we need to find out how much 80% of $40 is. That's 0.80 times $40, which is $32. So, the price in December becomes $40 + $32 = $72.

Now, in January, the price goes down by 50%. So, we need to find out what 50% of $72 is. That's 0.50 times $72, which is $36. So, the price in January becomes $72 - $36 = $36.

So, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Charlie teaches tennis lessons. He charges $80 for each lesson. Today, he had 4 lessons at the regular price. So, for those 4 lessons, he makes:

\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he had 2 lessons for veterans, and he gives them a discount. The discount is 25%, so he charges:

\[ 80 - (80 \times 0.25) = 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ dollars per lesson} \]

For the 2 veteran lessons, he makes:

\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much he made in total, we add the money from the regular lessons and the veteran lessons:

\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Charlie made 440 dollars today. The answer is 440 dollars."

Sally got these scores on her math quizzes: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60. To find her mean score, we need to add all these scores together and then divide by how many scores there are.

First, let's add them up:
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Now, we count how many scores we have. We have 9 scores.

To find the mean, we divide the total score by the number of scores:
630 ÷ 9 = 70

So, Sally's mean score is 70. The answer is 70."
"Eve started with 20 pomelos. She ended up with a quarter of that, which is 5 pomelos. To find out how many she gave away, we take the total she had and subtract the number she has left. So, 20 minus 5 equals 15. 

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos. The answer is 15."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 24 of them because 2/5 of 60 is 24. So, he had 36 apples left. Then he gave his sister 9 apples because 25% of 36 is 9. Now he has 27 apples left. He sold each of these apples for $3. So, he got 27 times 3, which is 81 dollars. So, the money he got is 81 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that's 3 out of every 4 novels she wrote this year. To find out how many she wrote this year, we can think of it like this: if 9 is 3 parts, then the whole (4 parts) would be more. So, if 9 is 3 parts, then 4 parts would be 12. Therefore, Regina wrote 12 novels this year. The answer is 12."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Michael is driving on the road and he drives at 50 km/h. If he drives for 3 days, and we assume he drives all the time without stopping, he drives for 72 hours. If he drives 50 km every hour, then in 72 hours he drives 3600 km.

Now, the total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. So, to find out what part of the total distance he has covered, we do this:

\[ \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance. The answer is:

\[ 60\% \]

The multiple-choice options might look like this:

A) 20%
B) 40%
C) 60%
D) 80%

The correct answer would be:

\[ C) 60\% \]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 times 6, which is 30 grapes. So, together they used 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.

Their mom then used the rest to make 4 pies, and each pie needed 12 grapes. So, for 4 pies, she used 4 times 12, which is 48 grapes.

Now, if we add the grapes Madeline and her brother used (36 grapes) to the grapes their mom used (48 grapes), we get 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

So, there were 84 grapes at the beginning. The answer is 84."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We start with 82 teachers. But 13 of them were sick, so we take those away. That leaves us with 82 minus 13, which is 69 teachers. Now, 9 more teachers came to help, so we add those to the 69. So, 69 plus 9 is 78. That means 78 teachers were at school that day. So, the answer is 78."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. He spends $1 on pasta, $3 on cheddar cheese, and $6 on gruyere cheese. So, every week he spends $1 + $3 + $6 = $10.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so to find out how much he spends in a year, we multiply $10 by 52. That means $10 times 52 is $520.

So, Bud spends $520 on making macaroni and cheese in one year. The answer is $520."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The custodian has to clean 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes for each classroom. So, to find out the total time needed, we multiply the number of classrooms by the time it takes for each one:
\[ 80 \times 15 = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to convert this time into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find out what percentage of their day they spend cleaning, we use this formula:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

So, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning. But that's not possible because a day only has 100%. This means they need more than one full day to clean all the classrooms.

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{250\%} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Elly has 110 books to put on her new bookcases. Each bookcase can hold 55 books because the bottom shelf can hold 20 books, the two middle shelves can hold 10 books each, and the top shelf can hold 15 books. So, if we add them all up, 20 + 10 + 10 + 15 = 55 books per bookcase.

Now, to find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold. So, 110 books divided by 55 books per bookcase equals 2 bookcases.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books. The answer is 2."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Rose bought 5 boxes of eggs, and each box has 12 eggs. So, she got 5 x 12 = 60 eggs. Each box costs $2.40, so 5 boxes cost 5 x $2.40 = $12.

Now, Rose sells the eggs. She sells them in sets of 3 eggs for $1. Since she has 60 eggs, she can make 60 / 3 = 20 sets. So, she can sell 20 sets for $1 each, which makes $20.

To find out how much profit she makes, we subtract the cost from the selling price. The cost is $12 and the selling price is $20, so her profit is $20 - $12 = $8.

So, Rose's profit is $8."

Skyler has 100 hats. Half of them are red, so that means he has 50 red hats. After taking out the red hats, he has 50 hats left. Out of these 50, 3/5 are blue, so he has 30 blue hats. That leaves the rest, which are white hats. So, he has 20 white hats left.

The number of white hats Skyler has is 20."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks in a bag and it usually costs $18.00. But there's a sale where he can get a bag for $15.00 because it's $3.00 off. Now, if he buys one bag, he gets 30 sticks. To find out how much each stick costs, we divide the price of the bag by the number of sticks. So, $15.00 divided by 30 sticks is $0.50 per stick. Now, we need to change that to cents, and $0.50 is the same as 50 cents. So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents. 

The answer is: **50 cents**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Audrey needs to get 70% of all the questions right to pass. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% right, which means she got 42 questions right. So, she needs to get 77 questions right in total because 70% of 110 (70 + 40) is 77.

Since she already got 42 right on the first test, she needs to get the rest right on the second test. The second test has 40 questions, so she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test.

So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to pass. The answer is 35."

Mary made some strawberry cubes. Let's call that number 20. Now, she made blueberry cubes, and the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. So, if she made 20 strawberry cubes, the blueberry cubes would be 5 times 20, which is 100, and then we take away 4. So, 100 minus 4 is 96.

She made 116 ice cubes in total. If we add the strawberry cubes (20) and the blueberry cubes (96), we get 116. That matches the total number of ice cubes she made.

So, the number of blueberry cubes she made is 96."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Four years ago, Ara joined the basketball team and played 40 games each year. So, over four years, she played 40 games/year times 4 years, which equals 160 games. In each game, she scored 21 points. To find out how many points she scored in total, we multiply the number of games by the points she scored in each game. So, 160 games times 21 points per game equals 3360 points. Therefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360."
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. He dropped half of them, so he lost 5 marbles. That leaves him with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles. When he found some, he found 3 marbles, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. But one of those was a bead, not a marble, so he got rid of that. That means he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles. So, the number of marbles Brendan ended up with is 7."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jason needs to sell 15 cars. For every 2 cars he sells, he gets 1 person to come to the dealership. So, to sell 15 cars, he needs 15 divided by 2, which is 7.5. Since he can't have half a person, he needs 8 people to come to the dealership.

Now, for every 25 calls he makes, 1 person comes to the dealership. So, to get 8 people, he needs to make 8 times 25 calls. That means he needs to make 200 calls.

So, Jason needs to make 200 calls to get 8 people to come to the dealership, and that's how he can sell 15 cars and get his bonus.

The answer is: 200"

Brianna and her family have 8 rooms. They have 2 flashlights for each room, so that's 8 rooms times 2 flashlights per room, which makes 16 flashlights. But they also have 4 people, so they have 4 flashlights for them. So in total, they have 16 + 4 = 20 flashlights.

Now, they have candles too. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, for the 4 rooms with small candles, they have 4 rooms times 4 candles each, which is 16 candles. For the 4 rooms with medium candles, they have 4 rooms times 5 candles each, which is 20 candles. So in total, they have 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Now, if we add the flashlights and the candles together, we get 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 things in total.

So, the total number of candles and flashlights they have is 56. If I had to pick from the options given, the closest answer would be 56."
"Mitchell bought two bags of chips, and each bag has 55 chips. So, he has 110 chips in total. His family has five members, and he wants to share the chips equally. To find out how many chips each person gets, we divide the total number of chips by the number of family members.

\[
110 \div 5 = 22
\]

So, each person gets 22 chips. The answer is:

\[
\text{22}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

John has to do different parts of the Rubik's cube, and each part takes a different amount of time. Here's how it goes:

- The first part takes 5 minutes.
- The second part takes twice as long as the first part, so that's 10 minutes.
- The third part also takes 10 minutes, just like the second part.
- The fourth part takes half as long as the first part, so that's 2.5 minutes.
- The fifth part takes the same amount of time as the fourth part, so that's also 2.5 minutes.

Now, if we add all these times together:
- 5 minutes (first part)
- 10 minutes (second part)
- 10 minutes (third part)
- 2.5 minutes (fourth part)
- 2.5 minutes (fifth part)

That makes 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes.

So, the Rubik's cube takes John 30 minutes to solve."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, we have 20 helmets. Now, for every helmet, there are half as many robots. That means there are 20 divided by 2, which is 10 robots.

And for every helmet, there are also half as many footballs. So, 20 divided by 2 is 10 footballs.

Now, to find out how many items there are in total, we add up all the helmets, robots, and footballs. So, 20 helmets + 10 robots + 10 footballs equals 40 items.

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is 40."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. Tim works 6 hours a day and each day he works 5 days in a week. So, he works 30 hours in a week. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 hours is the same as 1800 minutes. If it takes him 15 minutes to handle one call, then to find out how many calls he can handle in a week, we divide 1800 by 15. 

\[ 1800 \div 15 = 120 \]

So, Tim can handle 120 calls in a week. The answer is 120."
"Sure, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Louise usually dries one painting in 7 minutes with her old varnish. But today, with the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for one painting to dry.

If she has 6 paintings, with the old varnish, it would take:
\[ 7 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 42 \text{ minutes} \]

With the new varnish, it would take:
\[ 12 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the difference in time is:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

It will take 30 minutes longer for the new varnish to dry all 6 paintings compared to the old varnish.

So, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. Crista has 20 plants. Some of them need water in different amounts.

4 plants need half a cup of water each. So, that's 4 times 0.5, which is 2 cups.

8 plants need 1 cup of water each. So, that's 8 times 1, which is 8 cups.

The rest of the plants, which is 20 minus 4 minus 8, that's 8 plants. These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. So, that's 8 times 0.25, which is 2 cups.

Now, if we add all this up: 2 cups from the first group, 8 cups from the second group, and 2 cups from the third group, we get 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.

So, Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Phineas needs to go 200 yards to get home. Half of that is 100 yards on land and the other half is in water. He hops on land at 20 yards per minute, so to hop 100 yards, it takes him 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes. For the water part, he swims at 10 yards per minute, so to swim 100 yards, it takes him 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes. So, the total time is 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 15 minutes.

So, the answer is 15 minutes."
"Oh, okay. So Bob wants to make a big model of the Washington Monument using popsicle sticks. He thinks he needs 56 sticks. Now, each box of popsicle sticks has 8 sticks in it and each box costs $2.00. 

To get 56 sticks, he needs to buy 56 divided by 8, which is 7 boxes. And each box costs $2.00, so 7 boxes times $2.00 equals $14.00.

So, Bob will spend $14.00 to build his project."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a main phone that costs $20. The other phones cost half as much as the main one, so each of the other phones costs $10.

We have five phones in total, and one of them is the main one. So, we have four other phones. If each of these four phones costs $10, then together they cost $40.

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the cost of the other four phones. So, $20 (main phone) + $40 (other phones) = $60.

So, the whole phone plan costs $60."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. A dozen is 12, so that's 10 times 12 doughnuts, which is 120 doughnuts a day. June has 30 days, so he makes 120 doughnuts a day times 30 days, which is 3600 doughnuts in June.

Now, each doughnut sells for $2. So, if he sells 3600 doughnuts at $2 each, he makes 3600 times 2 dollars, which is 7200 dollars.

So, the money Derrick makes in June is 7200 dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Jade took 210 photos. She can upload 42 photos in one day because she has 6 batches of 7 photos each. To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload in a day. So, \(210 \div 42 = 5\). Therefore, she needs 5 days to upload all her photos. The answer is \(\boxed{5}\) days."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Alicia has clothes to send to the dry cleaners every week. She has 5 blouses, 2 pairs of pants, and 1 skirt. The dry cleaners charge $5.00 for each blouse, $6.00 for each skirt, and $8.00 for each pair of pants.

First, we calculate how much she pays for each type of clothing in one week:
- For the blouses: 5 blouses * $5.00 = $25.00
- For the pants: 2 pairs * $8.00 = $16.00
- For the skirt: 1 skirt * $6.00 = $6.00

Now, we add these amounts to find out how much she pays in one week:
$25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

So, she pays $47.00 each week. If we want to know how much she pays for 5 weeks, we multiply $47.00 by 5:
$47.00 * 5 = $235.00

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry cleaning in 5 weeks. The answer is $235.00."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way. John can talk really fast now. Before, he could say 150 words in one minute. After training, he can say 375 words in one minute, which is 2.5 times faster.

Now, if he has to say 10 pages, and each page has 450 words, he has to say 4500 words in total. If he can say 375 words in one minute, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to say 4500 words.

\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{words/minute}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take him 12 minutes to say all 10 pages. The answer is 12 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Conor went to the beach and counted the people there each day. On the first day, he saw 50 people. The next day, he saw 20 more people than the first day, so that's 70 people. On the third day, he saw twice as many as the second day, so that's 140 people.

Now, for the rest of the week, he saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 3 days left in the week, he saw 60 people/day * 3 days = 180 people.

So, the total number of people he saw in the whole week is 50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 180 (rest of the week) = 440 people.

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 440."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Garrett starts with 20 kernels that pop in the first 30 seconds. Then, in the next 30 seconds, three times as many pop, which is 3 times 20, so that's 60 kernels. In the next 30 seconds, four times as many pop as the first 30 seconds, so that's 4 times 20, which is 80 kernels. Finally, in the last 30 seconds, half as many pop as the last 30 seconds, so that's half of 80, which is 40 kernels.

Now, let's add them up: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels popped in total.

But after the pan is taken off the heat, some more kernels pop because they're still warm. A quarter of the kernels that popped in the last 30 seconds pop, so that's a quarter of 40, which is 10 kernels.

So, the total number of kernels that popped is 200 + 10 = 210 kernels.

Garrett has to eat 210 pieces of popcorn."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tim wants to make lemonade for a party. His recipe says he needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice for every gallon of lemonade. He needs to make 4 gallons, so he needs 4 cups of lemon juice. But he also wants to make an extra gallon that's twice as tart, so that's another cup of lemon juice.

So, he needs 4 cups for the regular lemonade and 1 cup for the extra tart lemonade. That's a total of 5 cups of lemon juice.

Now, he knows that 6 lemons make 1 cup of juice. So, to get 5 cups of lemon juice, he needs 5 times 6 lemons.

5 times 6 is 30.

So, Tim needs 30 lemons. The answer is 30."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

The kennel has 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food a day, and each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms a day.

First, let's see how much the German Shepherds eat in a day:
- 3 German Shepherds × 5 kg each = 15 kg of dog food.

Next, let's see how much the Bulldogs eat in a day:
- 2 Bulldogs × 3 kg each = 6 kg of dog food.

Now, let's add the two amounts together to see how much food they eat in a day:
- 15 kg (from German Shepherds) + 6 kg (from Bulldogs) = 21 kg of dog food a day.

To find out how much they eat in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (days in a week):
- 21 kg/day × 7 days = 147 kg of dog food in a week.

So, they need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have 10 animals that each have 2 legs and 15 animals that each have 4 legs. First, we count all the legs:

- For the 2-legged animals: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.
- For the 4-legged animals: \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs.

Now, we add these together to get the total number of legs: \(20 + 60 = 80\) legs.

To find out how many pairs of legs we have, we divide the total number of legs by 2 because each pair has 2 legs:

\[80 \div 2 = 40\]

So, we have 40 pairs of legs. The answer is 40 pairs."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a tower made of blocks. It has 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks because it has twice as many yellow blocks as blue ones. Now, we know the total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

So, if we add the blue and yellow blocks together, we get:

\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 8 \text{ (yellow)} = 12 \text{ blocks} \]

If we take the total number of blocks in the tower, which is 32, and subtract the 12 blocks we already counted, we get the number of red blocks:

\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Elvis drives west for 5 hours at 18 mph. So, he travels 90 miles west. Then he drives east for 8 hours at 18 mph, so he travels 144 miles east.

Since he drove west first, we need to see how much farther he went east than west. He went 144 miles east and 90 miles west, so:

144 - 90 = 54 miles.

So, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house now. The answer is 54 miles."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Gary bought a boat for $9000. In the first year, the boat lost 30% of its value. So, we calculate 30% of $9000:

\[ 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \]

So, after the first year, the boat is worth:

\[ 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \]

In the second year, the boat loses another 30% of its value, which is now $6300. So we calculate 30% of $6300:

\[ 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \]

So, after the second year, the boat is worth:

\[ 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \]

In the third year, the boat loses 20% of its value, which is now $4410. So we calculate 20% of $4410:

\[ 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \]

So, after the third year, the boat is worth:

\[ 4410 - 882 = 3528 \]

So, after three years, the boat is worth $3528."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a big bag of Starbursts with 232 pieces. Out of these, 54 are red. The number of orange ones is twice the number of red ones, so that's 108. And the number of yellow ones is half the number of red ones, so that's 27.

Now, if we add up all the red, orange, and yellow ones, we get:
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189

So, the rest must be pink. If we take the total number of candies and subtract the 189 we just counted, we get:
232 - 189 = 43

So, there are 43 pink candies. The answer is 43."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Helen stayed in a hotel for 3 nights. Each night cost her $80. So, for 3 nights, it would be:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]
That's the cost for the hotel.

Now, she rode the bus 7 times. Each bus ride cost her 10% of the hotel cost. So, 10% of $80 is:
\[ 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \]
So, each bus ride cost her $8. For 7 rides, it would be:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]
That's the cost for the bus rides.

Now, if we add the cost of the hotel and the bus rides together:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \]

So, Helen paid a total of $296 for her trip. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Mazie started with 52 marbles. She gave some to Dallas and some to Darla. Dallas ended up with 17 marbles after losing 4. So, Dallas got 17 marbles. That means the rest of the marbles, which are 52 - 17 = 35 marbles, were given to Darla and Dallas. Since Dallas got 17, Darla must have gotten 35 - 17 = 18 marbles. So, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is 18."
"Okay, let me break it down simply. They have 2 grown-ups and 1 kid going to the cinema. Each grown-up ticket costs $12, so for 2 grown-ups, that's 2 times 12, which is 24 dollars. The kid's ticket costs $8, so for 1 kid, that's 8 dollars. They also buy 2 popcorns, each costing $3, so for 2 popcorns, that's 2 times 3, which is 6 dollars. Now, if we add all these up: 24 dollars for the grown-ups, 8 dollars for the kid, and 6 dollars for the popcorns, we get 24 plus 8 plus 6, which equals 38 dollars. So, they pay 38 dollars in total."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step. John's car weighs 1200 pounds, and he has 250 pounds of luggage in it. He also has two kids, each weighing 75 pounds, so that's 150 pounds in total for the kids. Adding all that up, we get:

\[ 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to move the car, he needs to use a force that's 1% of the total weight. So, we calculate 1% of 1600 pounds:

\[ 1600 \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds. The answer is 16 pounds."
"To figure out how much crepe paper James needs, we first need to know the total length of the fence. The fence is shaped like a rectangle, and we know its long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet.

The formula to find the total length of the fence (which is what we need for the crepe paper) is to add the lengths of all four sides together. So, we do:

\[ 20 + 20 + 15 + 15 = 70 \]

So, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper. The answer is 70 feet."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mia is 40 years old, and she's younger than Emma. They're 16 years apart, so if Mia is 40, Emma must be 40 plus 16, which is 56 years old.

Now, to find the average of their ages, we add Mia's age and Emma's age together and then divide by 2. So, we do 40 plus 56, which is 96. Then we divide 96 by 2, and we get 48.

So, the average of their ages is 48. 

The answer is: 48"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432, and Benny found 86. So, if we add all these together, we get:
\[ 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 \]

But then they found out that 67 of these were cracked, so we take those away:
\[ 732 - 67 = 665 \]

So, the number of good seashells they found together is 665."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Avery needs to buy a set of three things for her dinner: a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl. She's having 12 people over, so she needs 12 of these sets.

The dinner plate costs $6.00, the salad plate costs $4.00, and the bowl costs $5.00.

First, I'll add up the cost of one set:
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

So, $6.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $15.00 for one set.

Now, since she needs 12 sets, I'll multiply the cost of one set by 12:
- $15.00 × 12 = $180.00

So, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Steve took 10 hours to finish the puzzle. Anna took 2 hours more than half the time Steve did. Half of Steve's time is 5 hours. If Anna took 2 hours more than that, she took 5 plus 2, which is 7 hours.

So, Anna took 7 hours to finish the puzzle. The answer is 7 hours."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Dexter has 5 pigs, and each pig eats 4 pounds of food twice a day. So, each pig eats 8 pounds a day. For 5 pigs, that's 40 pounds a day. In a week, which has 7 days, the pigs eat 40 pounds/day × 7 days = 280 pounds of food.

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of food. So, after the pigs eat 280 pounds, the amount left is 300 pounds - 280 pounds = 20 pounds.

So, the answer is 20 pounds of food left."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. John wants to give 2 hot dogs to each of the 20 people he invited, so that's 20 times 2, which is 40 hot dogs. But he already has 4 hot dogs from before, so he needs to buy 36 hot dogs. Each pack of hot dogs has 6 hot dogs in it and costs $2. To get 36 hot dogs, he needs 36 divided by 6, which is 6 packs. And each pack costs $2, so 6 packs times $2 is $12. So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs. The answer is $12."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way.

Frances sells cupcakes and cookies. She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each and 40 cookies at $1 each. So, she makes:
- From cupcakes: 20 cupcakes × $2 = $40
- From cookies: 40 cookies × $1 = $40

Total money she makes is $40 + $40 = $80.

Now, she buys 5 trays of cookies, and each tray costs $4. So, she spends:
- On trays: 5 trays × $4 = $20

To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the money she spent from the money she made:
- Money left: $80 - $20 = $60

So, Frances has $60 left. The answer is $60."

So, the ice cream truck starts with 5 kids. On the second street, each of those 5 kids gets another kid to join them, so that makes 10 kids now. Then on the third street, each of those 10 kids gets 2 more kids to join them, so that makes 30 kids in total. But then the 5 kids who were there at the start of the truck leave. So, we take away those 5 kids from the 30, and we're left with 25 kids.

So, the number of kids following the truck is 25."

Mamou was supposed to give out 1,360 meals. She gave out some meals on different days. On Friday, she gave out 64 meals, on Saturday 30 meals, and on Sunday 48 meals. Now, I want to know how many meals she still has to give out.

First, I add up the meals she gave out:
64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Now, I take the total meals she was supposed to give out and subtract the meals she already gave:
1,360 (total) - 142 (given out) = 1,218 meals

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to give out. The answer is 1,218."
"Okay, let me think about this. James found a quarter, which is 25 cents. He also found two nickels, and each nickel is 5 cents, so two nickels would be 10 cents. And he found seven dimes, and each dime is 10 cents, so seven dimes would be 70 cents. Now, if we add all these up: 25 cents for the quarter, 10 cents for the nickels, and 70 cents for the dimes, that makes 105 cents in total. So, James has 105 cents. The answer is 105 cents."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. We have a family with 2 brothers and 3 sisters. The sisters are all 16 years old, so together they are 16 times 3, which is 48 years. One of the brothers is 12 years old, and the older brother is twice that, so he's 24 years old. So, the brothers together are 12 plus 24, which is 36 years. Now, if we add the ages of the sisters and the brothers together, we get 48 plus 36, which is 84. So, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simple way that's easy to understand.

Charisma does meditation in the morning and at night. She does 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, so that's 30 minutes a day. She does this 5 days a week. So, in one week, she does 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes. Over 4 weeks, she does 150 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 600 minutes on meditation.

She also does yoga. She does 1 hour of yoga each day, and 1 hour is 60 minutes. She does this 5 days a week, so in one week, she does 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes. Over 4 weeks, she does 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes on yoga.

Now, if we add the time she spends on meditation and yoga, we get 600 minutes + 1200 minutes = 1800 minutes. To find out how many hours that is, we divide 1800 minutes by 60 minutes/hour, which gives us 1800 / 60 = 30 hours.

So, Charisma spends 30 hours on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks. The answer is 30 hours."
"To find out how many square feet the quilt is, we need to add up the square feet from all the t-shirts Octavia is using.

First, we calculate the square feet from the small t-shirts:
- Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
- Octavia uses 11 small t-shirts.
- So, \( 11 \times 3 = 33 \) square feet from the small t-shirts.

Next, we calculate the square feet from the medium t-shirts:
- Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
- Octavia uses 8 medium t-shirts.
- So, \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \) square feet from the medium t-shirts.

Then, we calculate the square feet from the large t-shirts:
- Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
- Octavia uses 6 large t-shirts.
- So, \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) square feet from the large t-shirts.

Now, we add up all the square feet:
- \( 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 \) square feet.

So, the quilt is 101 square feet. The answer is 101."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have small sunflowers with 3 dozen seeds. A dozen is 12, so 3 dozen is 36 seeds. A big sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small one. So, 50% of 36 is 18. Adding that to the 36 seeds, we get 54 seeds in a big sunflower.

Now, we have 36 seeds in a small one and 54 seeds in a big one. If we add these together, we get 90 seeds in total.

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is 90."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times as many as George, so Timothy has 54 pens. Sarah has half as many as Timothy, so Sarah has 27 pens. Therefore, the number of pens Sarah has is 27."
"Okay, let me explain it simply. We know Albert is 36 inches tall. Anne is twice as tall as Albert, so Anne is 72 inches tall. Now, Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 70 inches tall now. Before the summer, Jackie grew 3 inches to reach 70 inches. So, before the summer, Jackie was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall. The answer is 67 inches."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The company makes 5000 chocolate bars every day. In one week, which has 7 days, they make:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 35000 \text{ bars} \]

Now, for two weeks, they make:
\[ 35000 \text{ bars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Each bar is sold for $2, so for 70000 bars, the company gets:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the company will receive 140000 dollars for selling the chocolate bars in two weeks."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The first T-shirt costs $8, and the second one is half price, so it costs $4. So, the T-shirts together cost $8 + $4 = $12.

Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that are 40% off. The shoes originally cost $40, so 40% off means he pays 60% of $40. That's $40 * 0.6 = $24.

So, the total amount Jake spends is $12 (for the T-shirts) + $24 (for the shoes) = $36.

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Ryan gets $6 for doing his chores each week. He does his chores for 3 weeks, so he gets:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Then he buys ice cream cones. He buys one for himself and three for his friends, so that's:
\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \text{ ice cream cones} \]
Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the ice cream cones, he has:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he wants to buy movie tickets. Each ticket costs $6.50. With $13, he can buy:
\[ \frac{13}{6.5} = 2 \text{ tickets} \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The answer is 2."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Ellen bought leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. So, she spent $105 in total. Lani bought sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes, each costing $100, so she spent $30 + $200 = $230. If we add what Ellen and Lani spent, we get $105 + $230 = $335. So, they spent $335 in all."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tim makes a mix that goes in a jar. For each jar, he needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey. The passion fruit costs $6 a pound, the jackfruit $8 a pound, and the honey $10 a pound. He sells each jar for $50.

First, let's see how much it costs to make one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 each = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 each = $12
- Honey: 2 pounds at $10 each = $20

So, one jar costs $12 + $12 + $20 = $44 to make.

Now, if he makes 10 jars, the total cost is $44 x 10 = $440.

He sells each jar for $50, so for 10 jars, he makes $50 x 10 = $500.

To find out how much profit he makes, we subtract the total cost from the total sales: $500 - $440 = $60.

So, Tim makes $60 from selling 10 jars. The answer is $60."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Justin has a bunch of coins in a jar. He has 32 quarters, 95 dimes, 120 nickels, and 750 pennies. We need to find out how much money he has in total.

First, let's see how much the quarters are worth. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so 32 quarters are worth:
\[ 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the dimes. Each dime is worth $0.10, so 95 dimes are worth:
\[ 95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, the nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05, so 120 nickels are worth:
\[ 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the pennies. Each penny is worth $0.01, so 750 pennies are worth:
\[ 750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add all these amounts together:
\[ 8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money in the jar is $31.00."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Janet spent some money on different things. She bought ice cream for $3.50, two movie tickets for $7.50 each, and a bracelet for $8.50. First, I added up all the money she spent:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

So, $3.50 + $15.00 + $8.50 = $27.00. 

Janet's parents gave her $40 to spend. To find out how much she has left, I subtract the money she spent from the $40:

- $40.00 - $27.00 = $13.00

So, Janet has $13.00 left."
"Josh works 5 days a week because he doesn't work on Sunday and Wednesday. If he services 3 cars a day, then in a week he services 3 cars/day * 5 days/week = 15 cars. He gets paid $4 for each car he services, so in a week he makes 15 cars * $4/car = $60. For 2 weeks, he makes $60/week * 2 weeks = $120. So, the total amount he makes in 2 weeks is $120. The answer is $120."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. He eats 1 of each for breakfast, so he has 8 oatmeal, 3 chocolate chip, and 4 sugar cookies left.

Then he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, so he has 6 oatmeal cookies left.

After that, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he has 2 sugar cookies left.

Now, he bakes 4 more of each kind of cookie. So, he gets 4 more oatmeal, 4 more chocolate chip, and 4 more sugar cookies.

Adding the new ones to what he has left, he gets:
- Oatmeal cookies: 6 + 4 = 10
- Chocolate chip cookies: 3 + 4 = 7
- Sugar cookies: 2 + 4 = 6

So, in total, he has 10 oatmeal, 7 chocolate chip, and 6 sugar cookies. That's 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies.

So, the total number of cookies Randy has now is 23."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He wants to sell them to a buyer who will pay $5 for half of them and $7 for the other half.

First, half of his collection is 6 toy soldiers. If the buyer pays $5 for each of those 6 soldiers, Matthew gets:
\[ 6 \times 5 = \$30 \]

Then, the other half is also 6 toy soldiers. If the buyer pays $7 for each of those 6 soldiers, Matthew gets:
\[ 6 \times 7 = \$42 \]

Now, to find out how much money Matthew would earn in total, we add the two amounts together:
\[ 30 + 42 = \$72 \]

So, Matthew would earn \$72. The answer is \$72."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day. For 14 days, the dog digs:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate is not there, his dog keeps digging 6 holes a day, but Nate fills 9 holes a day. So, the net change in holes per day is:
\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill 84 holes with a net gain of 3 holes per day:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide 28 days by 7 to find out how many weeks it takes:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Norman High School has about 4000 students. Butler High School has fewer students, only 3/4 as many as Norman High School. So, we need to find out how many students Butler High School has.

To find out, we do 4000 times 3/4, which is 3000. So, Butler High School has 3000 students.

Now, to find out how much more students Norman High School has compared to Butler High School, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from Norman High School. That means 4000 minus 3000, which is 1000.

So, Norman High School has 1000 more students than Butler High School. The answer is 1000."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

So, they made a total of 7995 cookies. Out of these, they made 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. To find out how many chocolate chip cookies they made, we need to take away the rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total.

First, we add the rainbow and oatmeal cookies together:
\[ 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

Now, we take away this number from the total number of cookies:
\[ 7995 - 5670 = 2325 \]

So, they made 2325 chocolate chip cookies. The answer is 2325."
"Oh, hello there! Let me try to figure this out for you. So, Dr. Grumpus wanted Igor to get 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. Igor got half as many test tubes as asked, so that's 8 test tubes. He got two more Petri dishes than asked, so that's 14 plus 2, which is 16 Petri dishes. He got the right number of beakers, which is 7.

Now, if we add up all the things he got:
- 8 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 16 Petri dishes

That makes 31 things in total. But Dr. Grumpus wanted 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, which is 37 things in total. So, Igor must have lost some things. If we subtract the things he got from the things he was supposed to get, we get 37 minus 31, which is 6 things lost.

Since he got 7 beakers and lost a total of 6 things, he must have lost 1 beaker. So, the answer is that Igor lost 1 beaker."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

James is making 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs. So, for all the tables together, he needs 4 legs/table times 4 tables, which is 16 legs. Now, each leg needs 2 screws, so for 16 legs, he needs 16 legs times 2 screws/leg, which is 32 screws.

James has 40 screws. If he uses 32 screws, he'll have 40 screws minus 32 screws, which is 8 screws left over.

So, the number of screws James will have left over is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

We have a basket with 10 eggs. Now, there's another basket with twice as many eggs as the first one. So, if the first basket has 10 eggs, the second one would have 20 eggs because 10 times 2 is 20.

Now, to find out how many eggs we have in total, we add the eggs from both baskets together. So, 10 eggs plus 20 eggs equals 30 eggs.

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We have four girls: Alexandra, Kim, Sarah, and Maryam. Alexandra raised $430. Kim raised more than Alexandra, $320 more, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750. Sarah raised $300. Maryam raised more than Sarah, $400 more, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now, to find out how much they all raised in total, we add up what each of them raised:
- Alexandra: $430
- Kim: $750
- Sarah: $300
- Maryam: $700

So, $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2180.

Therefore, the total amount of money they raised is $2180."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. So, we have Vanessa running 4 miles. Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, but we don't need to know exactly how fast they ran to figure out how long Vanessa took.

We know Aaron took 16 minutes to run his part. Since he ran twice as fast as Vanessa, it means Vanessa would take twice as long to run the same distance. So if Aaron took 16 minutes, Vanessa would take 16 minutes * 2 = 32 minutes.

But the question is asking how long Vanessa took to run 4 miles, and we know she ran 4 miles. So the answer is 32 minutes.

The correct answer is 32 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it like I understand better.

The dock is 200 feet long, and for every foot of dock, we need 3 feet of line. So, for 200 feet of dock, we need 200 times 3 feet of line, which is 600 feet of line.

But we already have 6 feet of line. So, we need to find out how much more we need by subtracting the 6 feet we have from the 600 feet we need. That means we need 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line.

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line. The answer is 594 feet."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations each night. They order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine for each reservation. So, for each reservation, the cost is $5 for the first meal, $5 for the second meal, and $5 for the wine, which makes it $15 per reservation.

They get 6 reservations each night, so that's $15 times 6, which is $90 per night. Since they're open 2 days a week, we multiply $90 by 2, which gives us $180 a week.

So, the amount they make in a week is $180."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He made a profit of 25% on that. To find out how much he sold each watermelon for, we first need to know the total selling price. 

He made a profit of $80 * 0.25 = $20. So, the total selling price is $80 + $20 = $100. 

Now, he sold all 50 watermelons for $100. To find out how much he sold each watermelon for, we divide $100 by 50, which gives us $2.

So, each watermelon was sold for $2. 

The answer is: $2"
"Okay, let me explain it simply without the original answer.

So, we have James who is 18 years old now. His sister Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so she is 9 years old now. James is twice as old as Dora, so that checks out.

Now, John was 19 when James was born, and James is 18 now, so John is 18 years older than James. If James is 18, that means John is 37 years old now.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now. In 3 years, the son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

So, the youngest son will be 8 years old in 3 years."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Imagine you have a big basket of oranges. Ana and Jane are going to peel oranges, but they work at different speeds. Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange, and Jane takes 4 minutes.

Now, if they start at the same time and work for an hour (which is 60 minutes), we need to see how many oranges each can peel.

Ana peels one orange in 3 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges} \]

Jane peels one orange in 4 minutes, so in 60 minutes, she can peel:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, to find out how many more oranges Ana peeled than Jane, we subtract the number Jane peeled from the number Ana peeled:
\[ 20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges} \]

So, Ana peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The answer is 5."
"Okay, let me explain it like I'm not so smart.

Mark's car broke and he needed a new radiator. The new radiator costs $400, but he got it at a junk shop for 80% off. So, he only paid 20% of $400, which is $80.

Then, he had to hire a mechanic to put the radiator in. The mechanic charges $50 for each hour and it took 3 hours. So, the mechanic's fee is $50 times 3, which is $150.

Now, to find out how much Mark paid in total, we add the cost of the radiator to the mechanic's fee. So, $80 plus $150 is $230.

So, Mark paid $230 in total."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Farmer Brown has 20 animals, and all of them are chickens or cows. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. Together, they have 70 legs.

If we think about it, if all 20 animals were cows, they would have 80 legs (20 cows * 4 legs each). But we only have 70 legs, so not all animals are cows. That means some of them must be chickens.

If we count the difference between 80 legs (if all were cows) and 70 legs (what we have), it's 10 legs. Since each chicken has 2 legs, we can figure out how many chickens there are by dividing the difference by 2. So, 10 legs / 2 legs per chicken = 5 chickens.

So, the number of chickens is 5."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. Henry and his 3 friends are sharing 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 pieces. So, we first find out how many pieces of pizza there are in total. We do this by multiplying the number of pizzas by the number of pieces each pizza has:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pizza} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, there are 4 people sharing these pieces. To find out how many pieces each person gets, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ pieces} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ pieces per person} \]

So, each person gets 14 pieces of pizza. The answer is 14."
