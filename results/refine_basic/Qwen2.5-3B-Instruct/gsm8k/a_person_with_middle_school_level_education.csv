"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so that leaves her with:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]
Then, she uses 4 eggs to make muffins, so that leaves her with:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \]
Now, she sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market. Each egg sells for $2, so she makes:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]
So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find out how many bolts of fiber are needed for the robe, we need to add the bolts of blue fiber and the bolts of white fiber.

First, we know the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

Next, we need to find out how many bolts of white fiber are needed. The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. So, we calculate half of 2 bolts:
\[ \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt of white fiber} \]

Now, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:
\[ 2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts} \]

So, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is 3. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Josh buys a house for $80,000 and then spends $50,000 on repairs. So, the total cost before the house's value increases is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The house's value increases by 150%. To find out how much this increase is, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

To find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract the original cost from the new value:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

James runs 3 sprints each time. Each sprint is 60 meters long. So, if he runs 3 sprints, he runs:
\[ 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters} \]

He does this 3 times a week. So, the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total number of meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Wendi has 20 chickens, and she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed every day. So, for the whole day, she needs to give:
\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is left for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed for the day:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. For every second glass, he pays less. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5, which is $3.

So, for every pair of glasses:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- So, the total cost for one pair of glasses is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will have 8 pairs of glasses. So, the total cost will be:
\[ 8 \text{ pairs} \times \$8 \text{ per pair} = \$64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay \(\boxed{64}\) dollars for the 16 glasses."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step like I'm in middle school.

1. We know Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, we calculate:
   \[
   4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
   Charleston has 80 sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 80 = 160
   \]
   Toulouse has 160 sheep.
4. Now, to find out how many sheep there are in total, we add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse:
   \[
   20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. She can download 2 GB every minute. 

First, we need to find out how much of the file she downloads before the Windows update. She downloads 40% of the file, which is:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 200 \text{ GB} = 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB} \]

At a rate of 2 GB per minute, the time to download 80 GB is:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

After downloading 80 GB, she has to restart her computer to update Windows. This restart takes 20 minutes. Then she has to start downloading the rest of the file from the beginning. The rest of the file is:
\[ 200 \text{ GB} - 80 \text{ GB} = 120 \text{ GB} \]

At the same rate of 2 GB per minute, the time to download the remaining 120 GB is:
\[ \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add up all the time:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"Okay, let's break down John's journey step by step to find out how far he is from home after 4 hours.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered: \(3 \times 60 = 180\) miles.
   - So, after 3 hours, John is 180 miles away from home.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends 2 hours in traffic.
   - During this time, he doesn't move, so the distance remains 180 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered: \(0.5 \times 30 = 15\) miles.
   - So, after this, John is \(180 - 15 = 165\) miles away from home.

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Time left: \(4 - 3 - 2 - 0.5 = 0.5\) hours.
   - Distance covered: \(0.5 \times 80 = 40\) miles.
   - So, after this, John is \(165 - 40 = 125\) miles away from home.

Therefore, at the end of those 4 hours, John is \(\boxed{125}\) miles from home."
"To find out how much Eliza earned this week, we need to break it down into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, let's calculate her earnings for the regular hours:
- Eliza works 40 hours at a rate of $10 per hour.
- So, her earnings for these 40 hours are 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

Next, let's calculate her earnings for the overtime hours:
- Eliza worked a total of 45 hours this week, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
- Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is $10 * 1.2 = $12 per hour.
- So, her earnings for these 5 hours are 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

Now, let's add up her earnings from both regular and overtime hours:
- Total earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime
- Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

So, Eliza earned $460 this week. The correct answer is $460."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. In the first month, the program got 60 downloads.
2. In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]
   So, in the second month, the program got 180 downloads.
3. In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30%. To find out how many that is, we calculate 30% of 180:
   \[
   0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   So, the number of downloads in the third month is:
   \[
   180 - 54 = 126
   \]
4. Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
   \[
   60 + 180 + 126 = 366
   \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out the total cost of the pastries Toula bought.

First, we calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen donuts costs $68.
- So, the cost for the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen mini cupcakes costs $80.
- So, the cost for the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Then, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen mini cheesecakes costs $55.
- So, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total:
- Total cost = cost of donuts + cost of mini cupcakes + cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\) dollars.

So, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to look at the costs and the money he makes each year.

First, let's see how much money Carlos makes each year. He gets 7 lemons each year, and each lemon sells for $1.5. So, the money he makes from selling lemons each year is:
\[ 7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year} \]

Next, we need to account for the cost of watering and feeding the tree, which is $3 each year. So, the net money he makes each year after paying for the water and feed is:
\[ \$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year} \]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for him to make back the $90 he spent to plant the tree. We do this by dividing the cost of planting by the net money he makes each year:
\[ \frac{\$90}{\$7.5 \text{ per year}} = 12 \text{ years} \]

So, it will take Carlos 12 years to start making money from his lemon tree. The answer is 12 years."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So if she started with \( x \) vacuum cleaners, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) and had \( \frac{2x}{3} \) left.

Then she sold 2 more at the red house. So now she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) left.

After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. So she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) and had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) left.

We know she ended up with 5 vacuum cleaners. So we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]

Let's solve this step by step:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have a dance class with 20 students. First, we need to find out how many students are in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in contemporary dance. Now, we subtract these 4 students from the total number of students to find out how many are left:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining students are in jazz dance. 25% of the remaining 16 students is:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in jazz dance. Now, we subtract these 4 students from the remaining 16 students to find out how many are left for hip-hop dance:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

Therefore, 12 students are in hip-hop dance. To find out what percentage 12 students are of the total 20 students, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, 60% of the students are in hip-hop dance. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To decide which purchase to make, we need to look at how much each item will be worth after the market increases.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
   - Profit from jewelry = Future value - Current value = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value - Current value = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Now, we compare the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125
- Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

The higher profit comes from buying the jewelry. So, the merchant should buy the jewelry to maximize profit.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{125}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how far each train traveled in total. The train traveled 80 miles west and then 150 miles north. To find the total distance, we add these two distances together:

\[ 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles.

Now, let's look at the options to see which one matches our answer. The options are not provided in the question, but if we assume the options are:

A) 150 miles
B) 200 miles
C) 230 miles
D) 250 miles

The correct answer would be:

\[ \boxed{230 \text{ miles}} \]"
"To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate how much she earns from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her teaching earnings:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her annual teaching hours are 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year.
Her annual teaching earnings are 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year.

Next, let's calculate her coaching earnings:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

So, her annual coaching hours are 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year.
Her annual coaching earnings are 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year.

Now, we add her teaching and coaching earnings to find her total annual salary:
$35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step:

1. Claire uses 3 eggs every day.
2. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, she uses \(3 \times 7 = 21\) eggs.
3. Over 4 weeks, she uses \(21 \times 4 = 84\) eggs.
4. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we need to find out how many dozens are in 84 eggs. We do this by dividing 84 by 12, which gives us \(84 \div 12 = 7\).

So, Claire eats 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks. The answer is 7."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Marissa has a 12-mile trail to hike. She has already spent 1 hour walking the first 4 miles and another 1 hour walking the next 2 miles. So, she has already spent 2 hours hiking.

She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to spend hiking in total to get an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} \]

We know the average speed she wants is 4 miles per hour and the total distance is 12 miles. So,

\[ 4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total time}} \]

To find the total time, we rearrange the formula:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Marissa has already spent 2 hours, so she needs to spend:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

for the remaining distance. She has already walked 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles. So, the remaining distance is:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how fast she needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

So,

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve her goal. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We start with 10 liters of orange drink. Two-thirds of this drink is water, so we calculate the water as follows:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters of water} \]

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and three-fifths of this drink is water, so we calculate the water as follows:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters of water} \]

Now, we add the water from both drinks together:
\[ 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 \text{ liters of water} \]

But then we spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so we have:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters of orange drink left} \]

The total amount of water remains the same, which is 15.67 liters. Now, we need to find out how much water is in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The total volume of the mixture is now 24 liters (9 liters of orange drink + 15 liters of pineapple drink).

To find the amount of water in the 24 liters, we use the total amount of water:
\[ \frac{15.67}{24} \times 24 = 15.67 \text{ liters of water} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \boxed{15.67} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Samantha is 31 years old now.
2. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.
3. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. That means his son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. The answer is 2."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for Billy's sales on Tuesday.

Billy had 8 customers. Here's how many DVDs each group of customers bought:

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD. So, \(3 \times 1 = 3\) DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs. So, \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs. So, \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold:
\[3 + 4 + 0 = 7\]

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday. The final answer is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to figure out how long the candle burns and then use the rate at which it melts.

1. First, let's see how long the candle burns:
   - From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

2. Now, we know the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. So, if it burns for 4 hours, we can calculate the total melting as follows:
   - 2 centimeters per hour times 4 hours equals 8 centimeters.

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To find the original price of the book, we know that Kyle paid $19.50 after a 25% discount. This means he paid 75% of the original price. Let's call the original price \( P \).

So, we have:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Marie spent on the chicken meal, milk, and apples.

1. The chicken meal costs $12.
2. The milk costs $3 each, and she bought 5 packs, so that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The apples cost $1.50 each, and she bought 4 apples, so that's \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these costs together:
\[ 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars} \]

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the money spent on the boxes of pizza is:
\[ 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars} \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she bought, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[ \frac{17}{8.50} = 2 \]

So, Marie bought 2 boxes of pizza. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to add up the cost of the shorts, pants, and shoes she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- So, the total cost for the shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $59.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- So, the total cost for the pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- So, the total cost for the shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.00.

Now, we add up the total cost of all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00

Adding these amounts together:
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent a total of $253.00 on all the clothing items.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{253}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. She buys cartons that have 15 servings each, and each carton costs $4.00. We need to find out how much she spends on ice cream after 60 days.

First, let's see how many servings she eats in 60 days. Since she eats one serving a night, in 60 days she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cartons she needs. Each carton has 15 servings, so we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00, so for 4 cartons, she will spend:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16 on ice cream. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

Henry's trip is 60 miles long. He stops after 20 miles, so that's his first stop. Now, we need to find out where his second stop is. The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles, 15 miles before the end means he stops at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

Now, to find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop. So, 45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles.

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

The final answer is 25 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Gloria has two pairs of high heels. One pair costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which means it costs $66.

So, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:
\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

The problem tells us that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if we let the cost of the boots be \( B \), then:
\[ B = 99 + 5 \]
\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost $104. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, and their total age is 162. So, if we let Darrell's age be 7 parts and Allen's age be 11 parts, we can write:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

This simplifies to:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

So, Darrell's age is \(7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11 \times 9 = 99\).

Now, to find out how old Allen will be 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{109}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second friend guessed 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend guessed 60 jelly beans.

The third friend guessed 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend guessed 100 jelly beans.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we add these guesses together and then divide by the number of guesses.

\[ 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \]

Now, we divide 240 by 3 (since there are 3 guesses):

\[ \frac{240}{3} = 80 \]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog needs 0.5 hours a day. So, to find out how many hours he spends on one dog in a day, we do:

\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the hours he spends on one dog in a day by 7 to find out how many hours he spends in a week:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs. The answer is 35 hours."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

We know Gretchen has a total of 110 coins. Out of these, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \). Then the number of gold coins would be \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, so:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 110 - 30 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, to find out how many gold coins she has, we add 30 to the number of silver coins:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final answer is 70."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We know Raymond has 40 jewels. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we first find half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now, we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

So, Aaron has 25 jewels. The next part is that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels. 

The final answer is: 23"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.

First, we know he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. Now, we need to find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes. The problem says he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes than in the first 20 minutes.

To find 25% more, we calculate 25% of 4 points:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scored:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, to find the total points he scored, we add the points from both 20-minute segments:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Mike scored is 9."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Terry eats 2 yogurts every day. If yogurts are sold in packs of 4 for $5.00, we need to find out how many packs Terry will buy in 30 days and then how much he spends.

First, let's see how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
- Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
- So in 30 days, he eats \(2 \times 30 = 60\) yogurts.

Now, we need to find out how many packs of 4 yogurts he can get from 60 yogurts:
- Since each pack has 4 yogurts, he can get \(60 \div 4 = 15\) packs.

Each pack costs $5.00, so for 15 packs, he will spend:
- \(15 \times 5 = 75\) dollars.

So, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John has 13 lego sets, and he sells each for $15. So, we need to find out how much money he makes from selling all his lego sets.

\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

John then uses this money to buy 8 video games, each costing $20. So, we need to find out how much he spends on the video games.

\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the amount he spent on video games from the money he made from selling the lego sets to find out how much money he has left.

\[ 195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

But we know he has $5 left after buying the video games. So, the $35 he has left is the amount he had initially, which is the total amount he made from selling his lego sets.

Since he started with 13 lego sets and sold all of them, he still has 0 lego sets.

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John runs a total of 60 miles in a week. He runs for 3 days. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he runs in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how fast he runs, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, John's running speed is 10 miles per hour. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. We also know that skipping is half as fast as running. So, if skipping is 3 miles per hour, running must be twice that speed:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we need to figure out how much time Dana spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. The total time is 6 hours.

So, the time she spends running is:
\[ \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]

And the time she spends walking is:
\[ \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can calculate the distance she covers by running and walking:
- Distance running = Running speed × Time running = 6 miles/hour × 2 hours = 12 miles
- Distance walking = Walking speed × Time walking. We know walking speed is half of running speed, so:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 3 \text{ miles/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance Dana can travel in 6 hours is:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in 6 hours is 24 miles. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's, so we calculate it like this:

- Suzy's iPhone age = 1 year
- Ben's iPhone age = 2 × Suzy's iPhone age = 2 × 1 = 2 years

Now, Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so:

- Brandon's iPhone age = 4 × Ben's iPhone age = 4 × 2 = 8 years

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

The dragon can breathe fire up to 1000 feet away. Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. But when she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, we need to calculate how far she can throw it with the gemstone.

First, we calculate the distance with the gemstone:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we need to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand. The dragon's reach is 1000 feet, so we subtract that from the distance she can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it with the gold javelin.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

After the guests finished eating, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces the guests took, we need to subtract the pieces left from the total pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces left} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26. 

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that each serving of chips has 50 calories because 250 calories divided by 5 servings equals 50 calories per serving.

Next, you've already eaten 1800 calories. To find out how many more calories you can eat, we subtract 1800 from 2000:

\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to find out how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving has 50 calories, we divide 200 by 50:

\[ 200 \div 50 = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Each serving is 50 grams, so to find out how many grams you can eat, we multiply the number of servings by 50 grams:

\[ 4 \times 50 = 200 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 200 grams of chips. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Charlie wants to sell beeswax candles. For every pound of beeswax, he can make 10 candles. If he makes 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax because 20 candles divided by 10 candles per pound equals 2 pounds.

The cost to make 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00. So, the cost to make 20 candles is $10.00.

If he sells each candle for $2.00, then selling 20 candles will give him:
\[ 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00 \text{ per candle} = \$40.00 \]

Now, to find out his net profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
\[ \$40.00 - \$10.00 = \$30.00 \]

So, his net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. So, we need to find out how many more articles that is. 

First, we calculate 2/5 of 5 articles:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \]

So, on Tuesday, she wrote 2 more articles than on Monday. That means she wrote:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles} \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles} \]

Now, we add up all the articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Each article takes 4 hours to write. So, the total time she spent writing is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used some of them to put one on each of 220 cups of coffee. That means she used 220 Post-it notes. After using these, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

So, if we add the Post-it notes she used to the ones she had left, we should get back to the number she started with. Let's do the math:

\[ 80 - 220 + x = 23 \]

This means:
\[ -140 + x = 23 \]

To find \( x \), we add 140 to both sides:
\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

So, the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought is 163.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{163}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. So, he bought:
\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he bought:
\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie. Since a blue tie costs $40, a red tie costs:
\[ \text{Cost of red tie} = 40 + (0.50 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the red ties:
\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the blue ties and the red ties to find the total amount John spent:
\[ \text{Total spent} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, John spent a total of $800 on ties. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Tracy has a piece of wire that is 4 feet long. We need to find out how many 6-inch pieces she can get from this wire.

First, we need to change the length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we multiply 4 feet by 12 inches per foot:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we know the wire is 48 inches long. Each piece of wire is 6 inches long. To find out how many 6-inch pieces we can get from 48 inches, we divide 48 by 6:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy can get 8 pieces of wire. The correct answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many units are in the whole building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, we multiply 15 by 8:

\[ 15 \times 8 = 120 \]

So, there are 120 units in the whole building.

Next, we need to find out how many of these units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find out how many units that is, we multiply 120 by 3/4:

\[ 120 \times \frac{3}{4} = 90 \]

So, 90 units are occupied.

Now, to find out how many units are not occupied, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \]

So, the number of unoccupied units is 30.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Lloyd's chickens make 252 eggs every day. If we know that 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, then we can find out how many dozens of eggs he gets each day. 

First, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[ 252 \div 12 = 21 \text{ dozens} \]

Now, if he sells each dozen for $2, we can find out how much he makes in a day by multiplying the number of dozens by $2:
\[ 21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how much he makes in a week by multiplying the daily earnings by 7:
\[ 42 \times 7 = 294 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week. The correct answer is \(\boxed{294}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Tom's ship travels at 10 miles per hour. He travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours. So, the distance to his destination is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Tom has to travel back at 6 miles per hour. The time it takes to travel back 30 miles is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back. The answer is:

He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The correct answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step for clarity.

First, we need to calculate the total money the mechanic made on Thursday. On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.

1. Calculate the money made from repairing truck tires:
   - Each truck tire costs $60.
   - The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires.
   - So, the money from truck tires is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.

2. Calculate the money made from repairing car tires:
   - Each car tire costs $40.
   - The mechanic repaired 4 car tires.
   - So, the money from car tires is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.

3. Add the money from truck tires and car tires to find the total money made on Thursday:
   - Total money on Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the money made on Friday. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires.

1. Calculate the money made from repairing car tires:
   - Each car tire costs $40.
   - The mechanic repaired 12 car tires.
   - So, the money from car tires is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.

Now, we compare the money made on Thursday and Friday:
- Money made on Thursday: $520
- Money made on Friday: $480

To find out how much more money was made on Thursday, we subtract the money made on Friday from the money made on Thursday:
- Difference is \(520 - 480 = 40\) dollars.

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the animal shelter. Now, their mother tells them that their other two cats, Patchy and Trixie, had some kittens too.

Patchy had three times as many kittens as the adopted ones. So, if the adopted kittens are 7, then Patchy had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

Trixie had 12 kittens.

Now, to find out the total number of kittens, we add the adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens together:
\[7 + 21 + 12 = 40\]

So, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is 40.

The final answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Jean had 30 lollipops and ate 2, so she has 28 lollipops left. She wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we divide the remaining lollipops by 2:

"To figure out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to add up the cost of a ticket and the cost of popcorn for one trip. A ticket costs $7 and popcorn costs $7, so one trip costs:
\[ 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Peter has $42 to spend. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we divide the total money he has by the cost of one trip:
\[ 42 \div 14 = 3 \]

So, Peter can go to the movies 3 times with his $42. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many boxes can be added to the truck without making it too heavy for the bridge.

First, we know the bridge can carry a maximum of 5000 pounds. The truck and the driver together weigh 3755 pounds. So, the weight that can be added to the truck is:
\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can fit in 1245 pounds, we divide 1245 by 15:
\[ 1245 \div 15 = 83 \]

So, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 83.

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{83}

Stephen ordered groceries that cost $40.00. The delivery person added a fee that was 25% of the $40.00. So, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00 \]

So, the delivery person added $10.00. Now, we add this to the original $40.00:

\[ 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \]

Then, Stephen added a $4.00 tip. We add this to the $50.00:

\[ 50.00 + 4.00 = 54.00 \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $54.00.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know there are 25 oranges in total. Out of these, 1 is bad and 2 are sour. So, we can subtract these from the total:

\[ 25 - 1 - 2 = 22 \]

Now, we know that 20% of the oranges are unripe. To find out how many that is, we calculate 20% of 25:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

So, there are 5 unripe oranges. Now, we subtract the unripe oranges from the remaining oranges:

\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17.

The final answer is 17."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out the total cost of the brooch before insurance. Janet spends $500 on the material and $800 on the jeweler to make it. So, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

This means the total cost before insurance is $1300.

Next, Janet has to pay 10% of this total cost to get the brooch insured. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 1300 = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

So, the cost of insurance is $130.

Now, to find the total amount Janet paid, we add the cost of the brooch before insurance and the cost of insurance:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid is $1430.

The final answer is $1430."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Marcy's pension.

First, we look at the first 20 years. Marcy gets $50,000 per year for 20 years. So, we calculate:
\[ 20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000 \text{ dollars} \]

After 20 years, she starts getting 5% of the total pension value each year. The total pension value after 20 years is $1,000,000. So, 5% of $1,000,000 is:
\[ 0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Now, for the next 10 years, she gets $50,000 from the fixed amount and $50,000 from the 5% of the total pension. So, her total pension for the next 10 years is:
\[ 50,000 + 50,000 = 100,000 \text{ dollars per year} \]

Therefore, after 30 years, Marcy's annual pension is $100,000.

The final answer is \(\boxed{100000}\)."
"To find out how much Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost for the first half of the year. There are 6 months in the first half, and the service charges $140 per month. So, we multiply $140 by 6:

\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to calculate the cost for the second half of the year. The second half also has 6 months, but the service charges 10% less than the initial amount. So, we first find out how much 10% of $140 is:

\[ 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract this 10% from the initial amount to get the reduced charge for the second half:

\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost for the second half by multiplying $126 by 6:

\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the costs for the first and second halves of the year to find the total amount paid:

\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to figure out how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas. She drove 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas, so we divide the miles by the gallons to find the miles per gallon:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how many miles she can drive on a full tank of 12 gallons of gas:

\[ \text{Distance on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas. The correct answer is 300 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 1 hour. That means in one session, he spends 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session × 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks. So, 9 hours/week × 4 weeks = 36 hours.

The final answer is 36 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Each school sends:
- 5 players from the girls' team
- 5 players from the boys' team
- 1 coach for the girls' team
- 1 coach for the boys' team

So, each school sends:
\[ 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12 \text{ people} \]

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The treasure hunter found 175 diamonds.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the diamonds. So, we calculate the number of rubies as:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we calculate the number of emeralds as:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:
\[
175 + 140 + 280 = 605
\]

So, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 605.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{605}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We know there are twice as many boys as girls. If there are 60 girls, then the number of boys is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

So, the total number of students is the number of boys plus the number of girls, which is \(120 + 60 = 180\).

Now, we know that for every 5 students, there is 1 teacher. So, to find out how many teachers there are, we divide the total number of students by 5. That means \(180 \div 5 = 36\).

So, the number of teachers is 36.

The final answer is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"Bailey starts with some money and then gets $5 every week for 8 weeks. At the end, she has $100. We need to find out how much money she had at the beginning.

First, let's calculate how much money she got from her allowance over 8 weeks. She gets $5 each week, so:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]
So, she got $40 from her allowance.

At the end of 8 weeks, she has $100. To find out how much she had at the beginning, we subtract the $40 she got from her allowance from the $100 she has now:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60. The correct answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate her earnings from weekdays and Saturday separately and then add them together.

First, let's look at the weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

So, the number of students she teaches in one weekday is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 75 \text{ students/day} \]

The total number of students she teaches in 5 weekdays is:
\[ 75 \text{ students/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 375 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from the weekdays are:
\[ 375 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$5625.00 \]

Now, let's look at Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
- Each class has 15 students.
- She charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches on Saturday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 120 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from Saturday are:
\[ 120 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$1800.00 \]

Finally, her total earnings for the week are the sum of her earnings from the weekdays and Saturday:
\[ \$5625.00 + \$1800.00 = \$7425.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is:
\[ \boxed{7425} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Kelian has two recipes. The first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so it has 20 x 2 = 40 instructions.

To find out the total number of instructions, we add the instructions from both recipes together:
20 (from the first recipe) + 40 (from the second recipe) = 60 instructions.

So, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare both dishes. The final answer is 60."
"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the money he gets from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the money from the brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.

So, the money from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ brownies} \times 3 \text{ dollars per brownie} = 129 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the money from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.

So, the money from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ slices} \times 4 \text{ dollars per slice} = 92 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total money Tommy raises:
\[ 129 \text{ dollars} + 92 \text{ dollars} = 221 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Tommy raises is:
\[ \boxed{221} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Shiela bought 5 cell phones, each costing $150. So, the total cost of the cell phones is:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, there's a 2% interest on each cell phone. To find the total interest, we calculate:
\[ 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the total cost of the cell phones:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \text{ dollars} \]

Shiela has to pay this amount over 3 months. So, to find out how much she pays each month, we divide the total amount by 3:
\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Shiela will pay \(\boxed{255}\) dollars each month for 3 months."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Artie has three types of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He rounds the prices to the nearest dollar because he has no change today.

1. **Marigolds:**
   - Original price: $2.74
   - Rounded price: $3.00 (because 2.74 is closer to 3 than to 2)
   - He sells 12 pots.
   - Total money from marigolds: \(12 \times 3 = 36\) dollars.

2. **Petunias:**
   - Original price: $1.87
   - Rounded price: $2.00 (because 1.87 is closer to 2 than to 1)
   - He sells 9 pots.
   - Total money from petunias: \(9 \times 2 = 18\) dollars.

3. **Begonias:**
   - Original price: $2.12
   - Rounded price: $2.00 (because 2.12 is closer to 2 than to 3)
   - He sells 17 pots.
   - Total money from begonias: \(17 \times 2 = 34\) dollars.

Now, we add up all the money he makes from selling the flowers:
\[36 + 18 + 34 = 88\]

So, the total amount Artie will make is \(\boxed{88}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a 4 leveled sandcastle where the top level has 16 square feet.

1. The top level (level 4) is 16 square feet.
2. The level below it (level 3) will be half of 16, so it's 8 square feet.
3. The level below that (level 2) will be half of 8, so it's 4 square feet.
4. The level below that (level 1) will be half of 4, so it's 2 square feet.

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet
- Level 2: 4 square feet
- Level 3: 8 square feet
- Level 4: 16 square feet

To find the average, we add these up and divide by the number of levels:
\[ 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of levels} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.5} \]"
"To find out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will give to the puppy and then see how many bags that is.

First, let's calculate the dog food needed for the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food each day for 180 days.
- So, the total for the first 180 days is \(1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups}\).

Next, we need to find out how much dog food is needed for the rest of the year. There are 365 days in a year, so after the first 180 days, there are \(365 - 180 = 185 \, \text{days}\) left.
- For the remaining 185 days, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food each day.
- So, the total for the remaining 185 days is \(2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups}\).

Now, we add the dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining 185 days to get the total amount of dog food needed for the year:
- Total dog food needed = \(180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups}\).

Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia will need, we divide the total amount of dog food by the amount in one bag:
- Number of bags needed = \(550 \, \text{cups} \div 110 \, \text{cups/bag} = 5 \, \text{bags}\).

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year. The answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.
2. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we divide 400 by 4 to find out how much David does:
   \[
   \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we divide 400 by 2 to find out how much Raymond does:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract David's laundry from Raymond's laundry:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"To figure out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, let's look at the two ways he can buy the flowers.

First, let's see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in packages of 3. Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50. To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 6 packages because:
\[ 18 \div 3 = 6 \]
So, the total cost for 6 packages is:
\[ 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \]
So, it costs $15 to buy 18 flowers in packages of 3.

Next, let's see how much it costs to buy 18 flowers in packages of 2. Each package of 2 flowers costs $1. To get 18 flowers, Vincent needs 9 packages because:
\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]
So, the total cost for 9 packages is:
\[ 9 \times 1 = 9 \]
So, it costs $9 to buy 18 flowers in packages of 2.

Now, to find out how much Vincent saves, we subtract the cheaper price from the more expensive price:
\[ 15 - 9 = 6 \]
So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2.

Therefore, the amount of money Vincent saves is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

John takes his new dog to the groomer, and the original cost is $100. The groomer gives a 30% discount to new customers. To find out how much John has to pay, we first need to calculate 30% of $100.

30% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 100 \times \frac{30}{100} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, the discount is $30. Now, we subtract this discount from the original cost:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the cost of grooming after the discount is $70.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We start with 24 liters of water.
2. Two girls each get 1/6 of the 24 liters. So, each girl gets:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]
   Since there are two girls, they together get:
   \[
   4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Then, a boy gets 6 liters of water.
4. Now, we add the water the girls and the boy got together:
   \[
   8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
   \]
5. We subtract the total water they got from the original amount of water:
   \[
   24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the amount of water left is 10 liters. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Charlie starts with 10 stickers. Then he buys 21 more stickers and gets 23 more for his birthday. So, we add these up:

\[ 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 \]

Charlie then gives 9 stickers to his sister. So, we subtract those 9 stickers:

\[ 54 - 9 = 45 \]

Next, Charlie uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. So, we subtract those 28 stickers:

\[ 45 - 28 = 17 \]

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. First, we need to find out how much 4 times Grace's weight is:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract 2 pounds from 500 to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

To find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{623} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each bush has 25 roses. So, we first find out how many roses there are in total:
- 3 bushes × 25 roses per bush = 75 roses

Now, each rose has 8 thorns. To find out the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns each rose has:
- 75 roses × 8 thorns per rose = 600 thorns

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the team played 22 games. Let's say they lost \( L \) games. According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so they won \( L + 8 \) games.

The total number of games they played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, we add 8 to the number of games they lost:
\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games. The correct answer is 15."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Gene goes on 4 vacations each year. He started vacationing when he was 23 years old and now he is 34 years old. To find out how many vacations he has been on, we subtract his starting age from his current age:

\[ 34 - 23 = 11 \]

So, Gene has been on 11 vacations. Since each vacation is a quilt block, he has 11 quilt blocks in total.

The total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Greg's alarm rings three times a day. Here's what happened today:

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, it rang \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, it rang \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, to find out how many times the alarm rang in total, we add up all the times it rang:

\[4 + 12 + 6 = 22\]

So, the alarm rang a total of 22 times today. The final answer is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sylvie gets a monthly salary of $600. The company gives her a 10% raise every year for the first 5 years if she stays. Sylvie just finished her 5th year, so she gets a raise.

1. First, we find out how much the raise is:
   - 10% of $600 is $60.

2. So, after the first year, her new salary is:
   - $600 + $60 = $660.

3. Next year, she gets another 10% raise on her new salary of $660:
   - 10% of $660 is $66.
   - So, her new salary is $660 + $66 = $726.

4. For the third year, she gets another 10% raise on her new salary of $726:
   - 10% of $726 is $72.60.
   - So, her new salary is $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.

So, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary is $798.60.

The final answer is \(\boxed{798.60}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. So if Harald sold \( H \) copies, Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies. Together, they sold 88,000 copies.

So we have the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find out how many copies Harald sold, we divide 88,000 by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The final answer is:
\[ 8000 \]"
"Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. So, the number of guests who will come is:
\[ 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

She needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, so the total number of gift bags needed is:
\[ 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Christina will spend:

"To figure out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, we need to calculate how much the adults and children will eat separately and then add those amounts together.

First, let's look at the adults:
- Each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

So, the total potato salad for the adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, let's look at the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

So, the total potato salad for the children is:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we add the potato salad for the adults and the children together:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The correct answer is 225 pounds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, to find out the total number of pets, we add up all the pets:
\[4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28 \text{ pets}\]

So, the total number of pets the three have is 28. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know James is 10 years old and he is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Let's say Jackson is \( J \) years old. So, Amy is \( J + 5 \) years old.

Amy is also 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11 years old, Amy must be 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Now we know Amy is 9 years old and she is 5 years older than Jackson. So, if Amy is \( J + 5 \), then:
\[ J + 5 = 9 \]
\[ J = 9 - 5 \]
\[ J = 4 \]

So, Jackson is 4 years old. The answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
2. Lee used to be able to run it 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so Gerald's original time was 38 + 2 = 40 seconds.
3. Lee's speed is 400 meters in 38 seconds, so his speed is 400 / 38 = 10.53 meters per second.
4. Gerald's original speed is 400 meters in 40 seconds, so his speed is 400 / 40 = 10 meters per second.
5. Gerald's speed improved by 10%, so his new speed is 10 + 10% of 10 = 10 + 1 = 11 meters per second.
6. With his new speed, Gerald can run the 400 meters in 400 / 11 = 36.36 seconds.

So, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 36.36 seconds. The closest answer from the options given would be 36.36 seconds.

The final answer is: **36.36 seconds**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood. The number of cats is twice the number of dogs, so we calculate the number of cats as follows:
\[ \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many rabbits there are. The problem tells us that the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of dogs and cats combined. So, we first find the total number of dogs and cats:
\[ \text{Total number of dogs and cats} = 60 + 120 = 180 \]

Now, we subtract 12 from this total to find the number of rabbits:
\[ \text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168 \]

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{348} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 200 students in total. Out of these, 2/5 are boys. So, we calculate the number of boys:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]
This means there are 80 boys.

Since the total number of students is 200, the number of girls is:
\[ 200 - 80 = 120 \]
So, there are 120 girls.

Next, we know that 2/3 of these girls are in the girl scout. So, we calculate the number of girls in the girl scout:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]
This means 80 girls are in the girl scout.

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls not in the girl scout is 40. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we start by noting that Harry slept 9 hours. James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. So, we need to calculate how many hours James slept first.

To find out how many hours James slept, we do:
\[ \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:
\[ \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The answer is 3 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Freda's tomato sauce made 32 ounces, and this is half the volume of the tomatoes she started with. So, before cooking, the tomatoes were 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.

Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, and each can contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many cans she used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can: 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

Since each can has 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to find out the total number of tomatoes: 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes. The answer is 12."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We start with 30 cars on the motorway. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam. Then, in the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through. After that, 5 cars take an exit.

We need to find out how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's call the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes \( x \).

So, we have:
- \( x \) cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.
- 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.
- 5 cars took an exit.

The total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \).

The number of cars left on the motorway after the traffic jam is:
\[ 30 - (x + 20) \]

Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars left on the motorway is also:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 \]

We can set these two expressions equal to each other:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = 30 - x - 20 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = 5 - x \]

So, we have:
\[ 5 = 30 - (x + 20) \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ 5 = 30 - x - 20 \]
\[ 5 = 10 - x \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 - 5 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. So, she has:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Yesterday, she got 18 more potted plants from her nursery, so now she has:
\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Tomorrow, she plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family. So, she will give away:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

To find out how many plants she will have left, we subtract the plants she gives away from the total plants she has:
\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We have four friends, and we need to find out how many times the doorbell was pressed in total.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed it 1/4 more times than the first friend. So, we calculate:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, the second friend pressed it 25 times.
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70
   \]
   The third friend pressed it 70 times.

Now, we add up all the times the doorbell was pressed:
\[
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175
\]

So, the total number of times the doorbell was pressed is 175. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{175}

"Solo needs to read a total of 39 pages. He has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the number of pages he still needs to read is:

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

He has 4 more days to finish reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

24 pages ÷ 4 days = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average each day for the next 4 days. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

John drinks water with his meals every day, but on weekends, he drinks a soda instead of water with dinner. Here's how we can count it:

1. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**
   - Breakfast: 1 glass of water
   - Lunch: 1 glass of water
   - Dinner: 1 glass of water
   - Before bed: 1 glass of water

   So, for each weekday, he drinks 4 glasses of water. Since there are 5 weekdays, we multiply 4 glasses by 5 days:
   \[
   4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses}
   \]

2. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**
   - Breakfast: 1 glass of water
   - Lunch: 1 glass of water
   - Dinner: 1 soda (no water)

   So, for each weekend day, he drinks 2 glasses of water (breakfast and lunch). Since there are 2 weekend days, we multiply 2 glasses by 2 days:
   \[
   2 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ glasses}
   \]

Now, we add the glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
\[
20 \text{ glasses} + 4 \text{ glasses} = 24 \text{ glasses}
\]

So, John drinks a total of 24 glasses of water in a week. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}

"To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile. We do this by dividing 10 minutes by 3 miles:

\[ \text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cover the whole city, which is 42 miles. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to cover 1 mile by 42 miles:

\[ \text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:

\[ \text{Total time} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 14 \times 10 = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the fog bank 140 minutes to cover the whole city. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{140}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Amir eats 5 cookies. Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, so Cody eats \(3 \times 5 = 15\) cookies.

Now, to find out how many cookies they eat together, we add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number Cody eats. So, \(5 + 15 = 20\).

Therefore, the total number of cookies they eat together is 20.

The final answer is 20."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

John has 3 boxes, and each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. But the walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to find out how much space is inside each box.

1. **Finding the inner dimensions of one box:**
   - The outer length is 5 inches, but since there's 1 inch of wall on each side, the inner length is \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches.
   - The outer width is 6 inches, so the inner width is \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches.
   - The outer height is 4 inches, so the inner height is \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches.

2. **Calculating the volume of one inner box:**
   - The volume of a box is found by multiplying the length, width, and height.
   - So, the volume of one inner box is \(3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24\) cubic inches.

3. **Finding the total volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since John has 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3.
   - So, the total volume is \(24 \times 3 = 72\) cubic inches.

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\) cubic inches."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Frankie watched TV every night, and we know how much he watched each day. Here's a quick summary:

- Monday: 1 hour
- Tuesday: 1 hour
- Wednesday: 30 minutes (which is 0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes (which is 1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours

Now, let's add up all the hours he watched from Monday to Friday:

\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. So, the extra time he watched on Wednesday must be:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Since the extra hour he watched on Wednesday was a 1-hour episode, he didn't watch any 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

So, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:

\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Henry wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. But he ended up baking 15 more than he planned. After that, he dropped 5 cookies. Now he has 110 cookies.

First, let's figure out how many cookies Henry baked in total. He ended up with 110 cookies after dropping 5, so before dropping them, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

Since he dropped 5 cookies, the number of cookies he baked is 115. This is 15 more than what he intended to bake. So, if we subtract the 15 extra cookies from the 115 he baked, we get 115 - 15 = 100 cookies.

Now, we know that 100 cookies is twice the number he intended to bake last year. So, if we divide 100 by 2, we get 50.

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year. The answer is 50."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for someone who knows a bit about math but isn't an expert.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon. We do this by multiplying the number of gallons by the price per gallon:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

So, the total cost before any cashback is $30.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cashback. The cashback is $0.20 for every gallon. So, for 10 gallons, the cashback would be:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, we subtract the cashback from the total cost:

\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, after the cashback, the total cost of 10 gallons of gas is $28.00.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{28.00}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Marcell's fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Marcell ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Beatrice's fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups Beatrice ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups they both ate:
\[ 42 + 48 = 90 \]

To find the average, we divide the total by 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds. We need to find out how long it takes her to row 64 seconds. First, we calculate her speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes her to row 64 seconds. Since she rows 20 feet in 16 seconds, we can find out how many 20-foot segments are in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Number of 20-foot segments} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

The boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So, for 80 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

So, the boat took on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached the shore. The answer is:

So, the final answer is 25 flowers."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. The problem says Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, if we let the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold be \( B \), we can write:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]

To find \( B \), we divide 1800 by 6:
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Now, we know that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (which is 300) is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. So, if we let the number of ducks be \( D \), we can write:
\[ 300 = 50D \]

To find \( D \), we divide 300 by 50:
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6.

The answer is: \(\boxed{6}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Sasha has leftover lumber she wants to sell. She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each, and 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $16 each.

First, let's find out how much she spent on the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards, and each costs $10.
- So, the total cost for these boards is \(10 \times 10 = \$100\).

Next, let's find out how much she spent on the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards, and each costs $16.
- So, the total cost for these boards is \(5 \times 16 = \$80\).

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the leftover lumber:
- The total cost is \(100 + 80 = \$180\).

If she sells all the leftover lumber, she will get the same amount of money back, which is $180.

Since the total cost is $180 and the total revenue is $180, her profit is:
- Profit = Total revenue - Total cost = \(180 - 180 = \$0\).

So, Sasha makes a profit of \(\boxed{0}\)."

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On the first day, the customs officer counted 2 containers, and each container had 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles on the first day was:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. So, the number of vehicles that were added on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers that were added on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down in a simpler way.

Adrien's initial salary was $40,000. Four years later, his salary increased by 40%. To find out how much his salary increased, we calculate 40% of $40,000:

\[ 40,000 \times 0.40 = 16,000 \]

So, his new salary is:

\[ 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \]

Lylah's initial salary was 30% less than Adrien's initial salary. So, we calculate 30% of $40,000:

\[ 40,000 \times 0.30 = 12,000 \]

So, Lylah's initial salary was:

\[ 40,000 - 12,000 = 28,000 \]

Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, we calculate 40% of $28,000:

\[ 28,000 \times 0.40 = 11,200 \]

So, Lylah's new salary is:

\[ 28,000 + 11,200 = 39,200 \]

Now, to find out the total salary the two were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's new salary and Lylah's new salary:

\[ 56,000 + 39,200 = 95,200 \]

So, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{95200}\)."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the number of sheets he uses in one week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sheets he uses in a month. If we assume a month has about 4 weeks, then the number of sheets he uses in a month is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month. The final answer is:

So, the total number of fruits they have is 27."
"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, let's break it down day by day.

- On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
- On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
- On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
- On Thursday and Friday, she slept 1 hour more than the total she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. The total for Tuesday and Wednesday is \(6 + 4 = 10\) hours. So, on Thursday and Friday, she slept \(10 + 1 = 11\) hours each day.

Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. So, we can calculate how far she runs in those 3 hours:
\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

After that, she slows down to 5 miles per hour and runs for the remaining time. She has 7 hours in total, so after the first 3 hours, she has:
\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we calculate how far she runs in those 4 hours at 5 miles per hour:
\[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance she runs in 7 hours is:
\[ 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is 50 miles."

Jennie has a big pile of 60 letters that need stamps. She stamps one-third of these letters. So, she stamps:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ letters} \]

After stamping these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters that are already stamped. This means that before she started stamping, there were:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ letters} \]

So, when Jennie began, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Julia originally had some spoons, and her husband gave her 5 more spoons. Then she used 3 spoons to taste her stew. After that, she had 12 spoons left.

So, if we add the spoons her husband gave her to the spoons she originally had, and then subtract the spoons she used, we get the total she had left:
\[ \text{Original spoons} + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{Original spoons} + 2 = 12 \]

To find out how many spoons she originally had, we subtract 2 from 12:
\[ \text{Original spoons} = 12 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Original spoons} = 10 \]

So, Julia originally bought 10 spoons.

The final answer is:

The final answer is 120."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Dillon will spend.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. A watermelon costs three times what a pepper costs, so:
\[ \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so:
\[ \text{Cost of an orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Dillon is buying:
- 4 watermelons
- 20 peppers
- 10 oranges

Let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:

1. **Watermelons:**
\[ \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

2. **Peppers:**
\[ \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Oranges:**
\[ \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[ \boxed{880} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much profit the hospital makes.

First, we need to figure out how many hours of doctor time the hospital gets from seeing 500 people each day. Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, each patient is seen for:

\[ \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \text{ hours} \]

Since the hospital sees 500 people a day, the total hours of doctor time per day is:

\[ 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to know how much the hospital pays the doctors for these 200 hours. The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the total cost for the doctors is:

\[ 200 \times 150 = 30,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to know how much the hospital charges the patients. The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients, so the total revenue from the patients is:

\[ 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:

\[ 40,000 - 30,000 = 10,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{10000}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Nissa hires 60 elves to play in her store's Santa village.

1. First, a third of the elves quit because the kids vomited on them. A third of 60 is 20, so 20 elves quit.
   - This leaves 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit because the kids kicked their shins.
   - This leaves 40 - 10 = 30 elves.

So, the number of elves left is 30.

The final answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

In May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $60 less than that, so he spent $500 - $60 = $440.

Now, to find out how much he spent in total for May and June, we add the amounts together: $500 + $440 = $940.

So, the total expenditure for those two months is $940.

The correct answer is 940."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

First, we need to find out how many tickets Pam used:
- Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. So, for the roller coaster, she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Pam also rode the luge 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. So, for the luge, she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Therefore, the total tickets Pam used are \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Next, we need to find out how many tickets Fred used:
- Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. So, for the roller coaster, he used \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.
- Fred also rode the luge 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. So, for the luge, he used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets.
- Therefore, the total tickets Fred used are \(24 + 12 = 36\) tickets.

Now, we add the tickets used by Pam and Fred together:
- The total tickets used by both are \(24 + 36 = 60\) tickets.

So, the total number of tickets they used that day is 60."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, we calculate:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday to find out how many miles he walked in the first two days:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

We know that the total miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the miles he walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles:
\[ 41 \text{ miles (Monday to Wednesday)} - 28 \text{ miles (Monday to Tuesday)} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can follow these steps:

First, we need to know how many car washes Tom gets in a year. Since he gets 4 car washes each month and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 4 by 12:

\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Next, we know that each car wash costs $15. To find out the total cost for 48 car washes, we multiply the number of car washes by the cost of each car wash:

\[ 48 \text{ car washes} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

The correct answer is \boxed{720}."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he has 15 video games now.

The problem says Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. So, we first find out how many times 3 times Brian's new number of video games is:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Now, we subtract 5 from 45 to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know there are 27 unicorns in total. One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. So, we find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands. Now, we know that two thirds of these Scottish unicorns are female. So, we find out how many of these 9 unicorns are female:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

So, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns. The answer is 6."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out the total cost of Rory's delivery order.

First, we calculate the cost of the subs:
- Rory orders 2 subs, and each sub costs $7.50.
- So, the total cost for the subs is \(2 \times 7.50 = 15\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the chips:
- Rory orders 2 bags of chips, and each bag costs $1.50.
- So, the total cost for the chips is \(2 \times 1.50 = 3\) dollars.

Then, we calculate the cost of the cookies:
- Rory orders 2 cookies, and each cookie costs $1.00.
- So, the total cost for the cookies is \(2 \times 1.00 = 2\) dollars.

Now, we add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
- The total cost is \(15 + 3 + 2 = 20\) dollars.

Next, we add a 20% delivery fee to the subtotal:
- The delivery fee is \(20 \times 0.20 = 4\) dollars.

So, the total cost with the delivery fee is \(20 + 4 = 24\) dollars.

Finally, we add a $5.00 tip to the total:
- The final total cost is \(24 + 5 = 29\) dollars.

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is \(\boxed{29.00}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the first test:

1. Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test.
2. He completes 5 questions every hour.
3. So, in 8 hours, he completes \(8 \times 5 = 40\) questions.
4. The first test had 75 questions in total.
5. Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(75 - 40 = 35\).

Now, let's do the same for the second test:

1. Mark had 6 hours to complete the second test.
2. He completes 5 questions every hour.
3. So, in 6 hours, he completes \(6 \times 5 = 30\) questions.
4. The second test had 100 questions in total.
5. Therefore, the number of questions he left incomplete is \(100 - 30 = 70\).

To find out how many questions he left incomplete in total, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[35 + 70 = 105\]

So, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is 105. The correct answer is 105."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 12 blue gumballs. The problem says there are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs. So, we can write this as:
\[ P = 4B + 22 \]
where \( P \) is the number of pink gumballs and \( B \) is the number of blue gumballs. We know \( B = 12 \).

Now, let's substitute 12 for \( B \):
\[ P = 4 \times 12 + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we first need to know how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of them are automatic and 4 are manual.

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
\[ 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Now, to find out what percentage 4 cars are out of 20 cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 700 bees in total. The problem tells us there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens. Let's use a variable to make it easier.

Let's say the number of queens is \( Q \).

Then the number of baby bees is \( 2Q \) because there are twice as many baby bees as queens.

And the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times 2Q = 4Q \) because there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.

So, the total number of bees is the sum of the queens, baby bees, and worker bees:
\[ Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now we know there are 100 queens. To find the number of baby bees:
\[ 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

And to find the number of worker bees:
\[ 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. In one week, which has 7 days, he plays:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, Jordan earns $10 for every hour he works. So, if he works for 14 hours in a week, he would earn:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead is $140."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

John buys different things and we need to find out the total cost including tax. Here's what he buys:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

First, we need to add up the cost of the non-food items (light bulbs and roach traps) because they have a tax of 10%.

- Cost of light bulbs: $3
- Cost of roach traps: $4

Now, let's calculate the tax for these items:
- Tax on light bulbs: \(3 \times 0.10 = 0.30\) dollars
- Tax on roach traps: \(4 \times 0.10 = 0.40\) dollars

So, the total cost for these items including tax is:
- Light bulbs including tax: \(3 + 0.30 = 3.30\) dollars
- Roach traps including tax: \(4 + 0.40 = 4.40\) dollars

Now, let's add the cost of the food items (milk, eggs, and cups) which don't have tax:
- Cost of milk: $2
- Cost of eggs: $3
- Cost of cups: $3

Adding these together:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Cups: $3

So, the total cost of the food items is:
- \(2 + 3 + 3 = 8\) dollars

Now, we add the total cost of the non-food items including tax to the total cost of the food items:
- Total cost of non-food items including tax: \(3.30 + 4.40 = 7.70\) dollars
- Total cost of food items: $8

Adding these together:
- \(7.70 + 8 = 15.70\) dollars

So, the total cost including tax is:
\[
\boxed{15.70}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kim has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more, so he will have 8 clients in total. Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.

First, let's find out how much it costs to clean one client's house:
- Cost of 2 bottles of bleach: \(2 \times \$2 = \$4\)
- Cost of 1 pack of cloths: \$5
- Total cost for one client: \$4 + \$5 = \$9

Now, we need to find out the total cost for all 8 clients:
- Total cost for 8 clients: \(8 \times \$9 = \$72\)

Kim's total income each week is \$92. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total income:
- Profit: \$92 - \$72 = \$20

So, the profit Kim will make each week is \$20. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John has 10 hectares of a pineapple field. In one hectare, there are 100 pineapples. John can harvest his pineapples every 3 months. We need to find out how many pineapples he can harvest in a year.

First, let's see how many times John can harvest in a year. There are 12 months in a year, and he harvests every 3 months. So, we divide 12 by 3:
\[ 12 \div 3 = 4 \]
This means John can harvest 4 times in a year.

Now, we know that in one hectare, he gets 100 pineapples every 3 months. So, in a year, he gets:
\[ 100 \times 4 = 400 \text{ pineapples} \]
This is for one hectare. Since John has 10 hectares, we multiply the number of pineapples he gets in one hectare by 10:
\[ 400 \times 10 = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is 4000. The answer is 4000."
"Johnny has three lego sets. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, so it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has a quarter of the number of pieces as the first set, so it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

To find out how many pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:
\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up 2125 pieces of legos. The final answer is 2125."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half of the 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees leave as the first 6 hours, so that's 2 * 30 = 60 bees.
4. By the end of the first 12 hours, the hive has 15 bees left because 30 bees left and 15 returned.
5. In the last 6 hours, all the 60 bees that left earlier return to the hive.

So, in the last 6 hours, Debra sees 60 bees return to the hive.

The number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:

"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to add the cost of the tickets to the change she received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. So, the total cost for one adult and one child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the total amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, and Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. So, to find out how many friends Dorothy has, we divide Charlie's friends by 3:

\[ 12 \div 3 = 4 \]

So, Dorothy has 4 friends.

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4:

\[ 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.

The final answer is 16."
"Steve and Tim are racing home from school. Steve lives 3 miles away and can bike at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away and can skate at 264 feet per minute. We need to find out how long it will take each of them to get home and then figure out how long Steve will wait for Tim.

First, let's convert the distances to feet:
- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for each to get home:
- Time for Steve: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

So, Steve takes 36 minutes to get home, and Tim takes 40 minutes. The difference in their times is:
\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, Steve will be waiting for Tim for 4 minutes before Tim finishes the race. The answer is 4 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Shawnda charges 25 cents to inflate each tire. We need to find out how much she made by inflating tires for different vehicles.

1. **Bicycles:** Each bicycle has 2 tires, and 5 people came with bicycles. So, the total number of tires is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) tires. Since each tire costs 25 cents, the total cost for the bicycles is \(10 \times 25 = 250\) cents.

2. **Tricycles:** Each tricycle has 3 tires, and 3 people came with tricycles. So, the total number of tires is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) tires. Since each tire costs 25 cents, the total cost for the tricycles is \(9 \times 25 = 225\) cents.

3. **Unicycle:** A unicycle has 1 tire, and 1 person came with a unicycle. So, the total number of tires is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tire. Since each tire costs 25 cents, the total cost for the unicycle is \(1 \times 25 = 25\) cents.

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}\]

To convert cents to dollars, we know that 100 cents is equal to 1 dollar. So, \(500 \text{ cents} = 5 \text{ dollars}\).

Therefore, Shawnda made \(\boxed{5}\) dollars that day."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack has 6 cookies. So, he gets:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies/pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for all the cookies is:
\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times $0.10/\text{cookie} = $6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he gets, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill:
\[ $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00 \]

So, the change Carl receives is:
\[ \boxed{4.00} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. After the seagull, the number of fries left is \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
5. After the pigeons, the number of fries left is \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
6. A raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) \) fries.
7. After the raccoon, the number of fries left is \( x - 30 - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \).
8. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
9. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6 \implies x - 30 = 18 \implies x = 48
   \]

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 48. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how many hours Kimo spends on classes in one semester.

First, we look at the days Kimo has classes:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. So, each of these days he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours on classes.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), in one week he spends \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours on these days.
- Over 16 weeks, he spends \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours on these days.

Next, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, each of these days he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours on classes.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), in one week he spends \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours on these days.
- Over 16 weeks, he spends \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours on these days.

Now, to find the total hours he spends on classes in one semester, we add the hours from both types of days:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Bill bakes different types of baked goods and we need to find out how long they would be if we put them all end to end.

1. **Rolls**: Bill bakes 300 rolls, and each roll is 4 inches long.
   - So, the total length of the rolls is \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

2. **Chocolate Croissants**: Bill bakes 120 croissants, and each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - So, the total length of the croissants is \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Baguettes**: Bill bakes 60 baguettes, and each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
   - So, the total length of the baguettes is \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, we add up the lengths of all the baked goods:
- Total length = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes
- Total length = \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

To find out how long this is in feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
- Total length in feet = \(3360 \div 12 = 280\) feet.

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{280}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The zookeeper needs to feed the apes for 2 months. We know how many bananas each type of ape needs per month:

- Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

First, we calculate the total number of bananas needed for each type of ape over 2 months:

- For the monkeys: \(200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas}\)
- For the gorillas: \(400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas}\)
- For the baboons: \(100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas}\)

Now, we add up all the bananas needed for the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons:

\[400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}\]

So, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for Blake and Kelly.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each time he runs, he covers 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). So, if he runs 15 times, the total distance he runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back. That's 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times, so the total distance she runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, to find out how much farther Blake runs than Kelly, we subtract the distance Kelly runs from the distance Blake runs:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly). The answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Raphael bought 4 pens, and each pen costs $1.5. So, the total cost for the pens is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, he bought 2 notebooks, and each notebook costs $4. So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

The rim of bond paper costs $20.

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[ 6 \text{ dollars (pens)} + 8 \text{ dollars (notebooks)} + 20 \text{ dollars (bond paper)} = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Raphael spent a total of $34. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out from hiding, so the number of tadpoles increases to 11 + 6 = 17. But then, 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles decreases by 2. So, the number of tadpoles Finn can see now is 17 - 2 = 15.

Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now is 15. The correct answer is 15."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water. On Tuesday, it had 7 feet more than Monday, so we add 7 feet to 17 feet:

\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

So, on Tuesday, the tank had 24 feet of water.

Now, on Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find out how much water there is on Wednesday, we need to calculate two-thirds of 24 feet:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:

- Starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

So, the total number of fish they caught is:
\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

The final answer is 32."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. The original price of a bag of marbles is $20.
2. The price increases by 20% every two months. So, 20% of $20 is $4.
3. We need to find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months. That's $36 \div 2 = 18$ periods.
4. For each of these 18 periods, the price increases by $4. So, the total increase over 36 months is $18 \times 4 = $72.
5. To find the new price after 36 months, we add the total increase to the original price: $20 + 72 = $92.

So, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $92. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{92}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know:
- There are 5 red cars, and each red car costs $4.
- There are 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, so it also costs $5 (since each action figure costs $5).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of toy:
- The total cost for the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- The total cost for the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- The doll costs $5.

Adding these together gives us the total cost of all the toys:
\[20 + 15 + 5 = 40\]

So, the total value of all the toys is $40. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Jackie can do 3 fewer hours of freelance work if she does her taxes herself. She earns $35 for each hour of freelance work. So, if she loses 3 hours, she loses:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

Now, the accountant charges $90 to help with the taxes. To find out how much less money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of the accountant from the missed income:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{-15} \]"
"Elvira has a budget of €1500 for her birthday gift. She bought a computer with accessories that cost her €1090, a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. Let's add up the cost of all these items to see how much she spent.

First, let's add the cost of the computer and accessories:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add these amounts together:
€1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she has left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing. The correct answer is:
**€77**"
"To figure out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we can follow these steps:

1. Sandra needs 3 eggs to make one Spanish flan.
2. If she wants to make 15 flans, she will need:
   \[
   15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs}
   \]
3. Each time she babysits, she gets 9 eggs.
4. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total eggs needed by the eggs she gets each time:
   \[
   \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysitting sessions}
   \]

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to make 15 Spanish flans.

The correct answer is:
\[

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is \( B \) years old, Seth is \( 2B \) years old.

In 2 years, Brooke will be \( B + 2 \) years old and Seth will be \( 2B + 2 \) years old. The problem says that in 2 years, their ages will add up to 28. So we can write the equation:

\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Now let's solve this equation:

\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

So Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth is:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

So Seth is 16 years old. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain this clearly without the original response.

We know Ethel has $8. The problem says Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. So, we first find out twice the money Ethel has:

\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then, we add $2 to that amount to find out how much Jimmy has:

\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18. 

The final answer is:
\[ 18 \]"
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to add up the miles he walks on weekdays and the miles he walks on weekends.

First, let's calculate the miles he walks on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, and he walks 20 miles each day on weekdays.
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 20 \text{ miles/day} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the miles he walks on weekends. There are 2 days in the weekend, and he walks 10 miles each day on weekends.
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ miles/day} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from weekdays and weekends together to find the total miles he walks in a week.
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week. The correct answer is 120 miles."
"To find out how much each uniform costs, we need to add up the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants.

First, we know the hat costs $25.

Next, the jacket costs three times as much as the hat. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]
So, the jacket costs $75.

Now, the pants cost the average of the hat and jacket costs. To find the average, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket and then divide by 2:
\[ \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]
So, the pants cost $50.

To find the total cost of the uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants:
\[ 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \]

So, the total cost of each uniform is $150.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{150}

"Jake sees different types of creatures in the museum, and we need to find out how many legs he sees in total. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we look at the spiders. There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. So, the total number of legs from the spiders is:
\[ 80 \times 8 = 640 \]

Next, we look at the insects. There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. So, the total number of legs from the insects is:
\[ 90 \times 6 = 540 \]

Then, we look at the rare mutant invertebrates. There are 3 of these, and each one has 10 legs. So, the total number of legs from the rare mutant invertebrates is:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]

Now, we add up all the legs from the spiders, insects, and rare mutant invertebrates:
\[ 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210 \]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{1210} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds. Since the problem doesn't give us the age of the Caboose, we'll assume it's the same as Sally Thirtytwo and Sally Four, which is 8 years old.

So, the total age is:
\[ 19 \text{ (Sally Two)} + 16 \text{ (Granny Red)} + 8 \text{ (Sally Four)} + 8 \text{ (Caboose)} = 51 \]

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Jessica has three debts:
- Student loans: $300 a month
- Credit card: $200 a month
- Mortgage: $500 a month

First, we add these up to find the total minimum payment each month:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than this minimum. To find 50% of $1000, we do:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, she wants to pay:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \] each month.

Now, to find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply this monthly amount by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{18000} \]"
"Billy needs to peel and cut each potato. It takes him 1.5 minutes to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut it. So, for one potato, it takes:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} + 0.0833 \text{ minutes} = 1.5833 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he has 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for one potato by 60:

\[ 1.5833 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{95} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much they sold in total to make a profit of $25. They sell each glass for $0.50 and get 20 glasses per gallon. So, for each gallon, they make:

\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

They made a profit of $25, and we know that profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total revenue is the number of gallons they sold times the price per gallon. Let's say they sold \( x \) gallons. So, the total revenue is:

\[ \$10x \]

The total cost includes the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is:

\[ \$3 \text{ (lemons)} + \$2 \text{ (sugar)} = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

So, the total cost for \( x \) gallons is:

\[ \$5x \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$10x - \$5x = \$25 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ \$5x = \$25 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[ x = \frac{\$25}{\$5} = 5 \]

So, they sold 5 gallons of lemonade. Now, we calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:

\[ \$3 \text{ (lemons/gallon)} \times 5 \text{ gallons} = \$15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:

\[ \$15 \]

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 240 people in total, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the rest must be Chinese. To find out how many Chinese people there are, we subtract the number of Japanese people from the total number of people:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

So, there are 160 Chinese people in the race. We are told that 60 of these Chinese people are boys. To find out how many are girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

So, there are 100 girls on the Chinese team. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Zaid earns $6000 a month. He spends:
- 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is $6000 / 4 = $1500.
- 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is $6000 / 3 = $2000.

So, after paying for rent and car fuel, he has:
\[ 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 \]

Next, he donates half of the remaining amount to charity:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \]

After the donation, he has:
\[ 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \]

Then, he gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700:
\[ 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350 \]

So, the amount of money Zaid will have left is $350.

The final answer is: **$350**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs} \]

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs} \]

Now, we add up all the crabs:
\[ 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \text{ crabs} \]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122."
"To find out how much Lloyd earned in the first two weeks, we need to calculate his earnings for each week and then add them together.

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours and earns $10 per hour. So, his earnings for the first week are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours. So, his earnings for the second week are:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks. The correct answer is \$130."
"To find out how many votes the loser got, we first need to know how many votes the winner got. The winner got 3/4 of the total votes, and the total number of votes is 80.

Let's calculate the number of votes the winner got:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]
So, the winner got 60 votes.

Now, to find out how many votes the loser got, we subtract the winner's votes from the total votes:
\[
80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the loser got 20 votes.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sandra ordered white carnations, and we found out she ordered 40 of them. Now, she needs four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, we multiply the number of white carnations by 4:

\[ 40 \times 4 = 160 \]

So, Sandra needs 160 red roses to be delivered by 5 pm. This is the number of red roses Fred must deliver to keep Sandra happy.

The answer is: \(\boxed{160}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

We know Jan is 30 years old now. Two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. At that time, Mark was 5 years younger than half of Jan's age. So, half of Jan's age two years ago was:

\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Mark was 5 years younger than 14, so:

\[ 14 - 5 = 9 \]

This means Mark was 9 years old two years ago. So, Mark's current age is:

\[ 9 + 2 = 11 \]

Jean is two years older than Mark, so:

\[ 11 + 2 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jean is 13 years old now. The correct answer is:

13"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have two teams competing in a relay race where each team has four members, and each member runs 400 meters.

### Team 1 (Very Well-Rounded Team)
Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for Team 1 is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

### Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team)
The first runner takes 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Now, let's add up the times for Team 2:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

### Difference in Time
To find out how many seconds Team 1 wins by, we subtract the total time of Team 1 from the total time of Team 2:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, Team 1 wins by 2 seconds. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step in a simpler way.

We have a six-sided die, and we want to know how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.

First, let's look at the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. This gives us:
\[ \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Next, let's look at the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is \( \frac{1}{2} \), and the same for the second roll. Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening is:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]
So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( \frac{1}{4} \).

Now, we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then converting that difference to a percentage:
\[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]
To find out how much more likely it is, we divide this difference by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and then convert to a percentage:
\[ \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, it is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Jenna's mom picked 20 apples. Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, so Jenna picked:

\[ 20 \div 2 = 10 \text{ apples} \]

Together, they picked:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they both picked is 30. The correct answer is 30."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Russell has distributed 160 pieces of straw among the small rodents. We have information about how many pieces each type of rodent gets:

- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, so the total pieces of straw for hamsters is \(10 \times 5 = 50\) pieces.
- There are 20 pieces of straw for the rabbits.

So, the total pieces of straw for hamsters and rabbits is \(50 + 20 = 70\) pieces.

Now, we subtract the pieces of straw for hamsters and rabbits from the total pieces of straw to find out how many pieces are left for the rats:
\[160 - 70 = 90\]

Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw and there are 3 cages of rats, we can find out how many rats there are by dividing the total pieces of straw for rats by the number of pieces each rat gets:
\[90 \div 6 = 15\]

So, there are 15 rats in total. Since there are 3 cages, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages to find out how many rats are in each cage:
\[15 \div 3 = 5\]

Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage. The answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To find out how much Mandy should give Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the interest first and then add it to the original amount.

Mandy owes Benedict $100 and there's a 2% interest rate per month. So, let's calculate the interest for 3 months.

1. **Interest per month**: 
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

2. **Total interest for 3 months**:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Total amount to pay**:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mandy should give Benedict **$106**.

The correct answer is **$106**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

The trader buys some bags of wheat at $20 per bag. So, the cost of buying \( n \) bags is \( 20n \) dollars. The cost to transport each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for \( n \) bags is \( 2n \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost to buy and transport the wheat is:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \text{ dollars} \]

The trader sells each bag for $30, so the total money made from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \text{ dollars} \]

The trader's profit is the total money made minus the total cost. The problem states that the trader made a profit of $400. So, we can write the profit equation as:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much they spent in total. They bought 3 tickets that cost $20.25. So, the tickets cost:
\[ 20.25 \times 3 = 60.75 \]

But they also spent $4.50 less on food than on tickets. So, the cost of the food is:
\[ 60.75 - 4.50 = 56.25 \]

Now, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food:
\[ 60.75 + 56.25 = 117 \]

They also went on 2 rides, and each ride cost $33. So, the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, we add the cost of the tickets, food, and rides to find the total cost:
\[ 117 + 66 = 183 \]

Since there are 3 friends, we divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each person paid:
\[ \frac{183}{3} = 61 \]

So, each person paid $61. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{61} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. If he collects 2 peaches every minute, we need to find out how many peaches he collects in total.

First, we calculate how many minutes are in 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply 3 hours by 60 minutes per hour:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know he collects 2 peaches every minute. So, to find out the total number of peaches he collects in 180 minutes, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute:
\[ 180 \times 2 = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the total number of peaches John collects is 360. The correct answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we start by knowing that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how much each duck needs per day by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we have 10 ducks in the flock. To find out how much insects all the ducks need per day, we multiply the amount one duck needs per day by the number of ducks:

\[ 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is 5 pounds. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
3. After 10 years, the total number of trees he will have is \(50 + 8 \times 10 = 50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
4. After 10 years, 30% of these trees die. So, \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees die.
5. Therefore, the number of trees left is \(130 - 39 = 91\).

So, after 10 years, Tom has \(\boxed{91}\) trees left."

1. On Friday morning, Sue has 18 pink plastic flamingos in her front yard.
2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors take back one third of the flamingos. One third of 18 is 6 flamingos. So, they take back 6 pink flamingos and paint them white.
3. After taking back 6 flamingos, Sue has \(18 - 6 = 12\) pink flamingos left.
4. On Sunday morning, they add another 18 pink flamingos to the yard. So, Sue now has \(12 + 18 = 30\) pink flamingos.
5. They also put back the 6 white flamingos they painted on Saturday.
6. Now, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos. Sue has 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
7. The difference is \(30 - 6 = 24\).

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Violetta wants to buy crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. So, we need to find out the total cost of the crayons first.

1. Calculate the total cost:
\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Violetta has $20 to spend. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the change Violetta will get is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. So, if we add the cost of a pencil and an eraser together, we get:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means a pen costs $1.50. Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We do this by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, 8 pens will cost $12.00. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 200 pounds of carrots to give to 40 restaurants. Each restaurant gets 2 pounds of carrots.

First, we need to find out how many pounds of carrots all the restaurants will get together. We do this by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount each restaurant gets:
\[ 40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount of carrots given to the restaurants from the total amount of carrots we started with:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find out how many children there are in the city of Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

The total population is 23,786.
The number of men is 8,417.
The number of women is 9,092.

First, we add the number of men and women together:
8,417 + 9,092 = 17,509

Now, we subtract this sum from the total population to find the number of children:
23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277

So, the number of children in Soda is 6,277.

The correct answer is 6,277."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has in total.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

5. **Total number of cards collected over the three months:**
   \[
   60 + 40 + 200 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

6. **Total number of cards Elaine has now:**
   Adding the initial number of cards to the total number of cards collected over the three months.
   \[
   20 + 200 = 220 \text{ cards}
   \]

So, Elaine now has a total of 220 Pokemon cards. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{220}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents for each sentence. So, for Publisher A, he earns:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents per sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, so Publisher B pays him 10 cents for each sentence. For Publisher B, he earns:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents per sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, to find out how much Mark makes in total in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

So, Mark makes 15000 cents in a week. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Baldur gets water from a well. He gets 5 pails of water in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. Each pail has 5 liters of water. We need to find out how many liters of water he gets in a day.

First, let's find out how many pails he gets in a day:
- In the morning, he gets 5 pails.
- In the afternoon, he gets 6 pails.
- So, in total, he gets 5 + 6 = 11 pails in a day.

Now, we know that each pail has 5 liters of water. So, to find out the total liters of water he gets in a day, we multiply the number of pails by the liters each pail contains:
- 11 pails × 5 liters per pail = 55 liters.

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day. The answer is 55 liters."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

John got a big prize at work. This prize has two parts:
1. A one-time money prize of $5000.
2. A raise in his salary. His salary was $2000 a week, and the raise is 5% of that. So, 5% of $2000 is $100. That means his new salary is $2000 + $100 = $2100 a week.

Now, if John gets this raise every week of the year, and there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate how much he makes in a year from his new salary:
\[ 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

But we also need to add the $5000 prize he got at the beginning of the year. So, we add that to his yearly salary:
\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is $114200.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{114200}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Josie has a farm that is 10 acres big. Each acre can grow 5 tons of grapes every year. So, if we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes each acre can produce, we get the total tons of grapes:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Now, each ton of grapes can be turned into 2 barrels of wine. So, if we take the total tons of grapes and multiply that by 2, we get the total barrels of wine:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, Josie's farm can produce 100 barrels of wine every year. The answer is 100 barrels."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Carl eats a sandwich every day for 5 days. Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese. So, for sandwiches, he uses:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \]

For breakfast, he eats omelets 3 days a week. Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses:
\[ 2 \text{ slices} + 1 \text{ slice} = 3 \text{ slices} \]
So, for omelets, he uses:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

For dinner, he makes a big dish of macaroni and cheese and uses 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up all the cheese slices:
\[ 10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of cheese slices Carl used is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Janet originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. That's a total of:
\[ 22 + 10 = 32 \text{ pens} \]

Then, she bought some pens in bags. She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag. So, the total number of blue pens she bought is:
\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag. So, the total number of red pens she bought is:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, to find out how many pens she has in total, we add all the pens together:
\[ 32 \text{ (original pens)} + 54 \text{ (blue pens)} + 12 \text{ (red pens)} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

So, Janet has 98 pens now. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

First, let's add up the scores of the first five tests:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Now, to have an average of 93 over six tests, the total sum of all six test scores should be:
\[ 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

So, the score Brinley needs on her sixth test is:
\[ 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 118 on her sixth test to have an average of 93.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{118} \]"
"To find out how many kilometers Micheal rode his bike in total, we need to break it down into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

Now, to find the total kilometers he rode, we add the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks:
- Total kilometers = \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

So, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To find out how much Joe's bag of candy weighs, we need to add the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples together.

First, we know each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar. Since a chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, a candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Joe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday, she bought three times as many cakes as she did on Monday. So, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
On Wednesday, she bought five times as many cakes as she did on Tuesday. So, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, to find out how many cakes she bought in total, we add the cakes from all three days:
\[4 + 12 + 60 = 76\]

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes over the three days. The final answer is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down in a simpler way for middle school level understanding.

1. We know that half a dozen plates cost $6000. So, one plate costs $6000 divided by 6, which is $1000.
2. Now, we need to find out how much twenty dozen cups cost. We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the cost of half a dozen plates.
3. Half a dozen plates cost $6000, so twenty dozen cups cost $6000 - $1200 = $4800.
4. Twenty dozen cups is 240 cups, so if 240 cups cost $4800, then one cup costs $4800 divided by 240.

Now, let's do the division: $4800 ÷ 240 = $20.

So, the cost of each cup is $20.

The final answer is: **$20**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Sara wants to buy a jacket that costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes, each costing $20. So, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Sara already has $10 saved. So, she needs to earn:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits and she babysits 4 times. So, she earns:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

This means she still needs:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn the remaining $40, we divide:
\[ \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

So, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to have enough money to buy the jacket and shoes. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Also, he has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's say Jerry has \( r \) red chickens. Then he has \( r + 2 \) white chickens because he has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Each red chicken gives 3 eggs a day, so \( r \) red chickens give \( 3r \) eggs a day.
Each white chicken gives 5 eggs a day, so \( r + 2 \) white chickens give \( 5(r + 2) \) eggs a day.

The total number of eggs collected every day is the sum of the eggs from the red chickens and the white chickens. So we have:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Now let's solve this equation:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To check, if he has 4 red chickens, he has \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) white chickens. The total eggs would be:
\[ 3 \times 4 + 5 \times 6 = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

This matches the number of eggs Jerry collects every day. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is 4.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle that measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

So, we add the length and the width together:

\[ 1.5 + 6 = 7.5 \text{ miles} \]

Then we multiply by 2:

\[ 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now we know Gary walks 15 miles. He walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we divide the total distance by his speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. The next day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.

Now, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers on the first and second days from the total number of customers:
500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 customers.

So, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, if the small pool had \( S \) gallons of water 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 2S \) gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 2S + 4 \times 4 = 2S + 16 \) gallons, and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

But we also know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so:
\[ 2S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 2S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
This doesn't make sense because it would mean \( 16 = 32 \), which is wrong. So, let's use the second piece of information given: the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool.

So, if the small pool has \( S \) gallons now, the big pool has \( 4S \) gallons now.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, the current amount of water in the big pool is \( 4S \) and the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S \).

We know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 2S + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons. But we also know that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so:
\[ 4S = 4(S + 16) \]
\[ 4S = 4S + 64 \]
This doesn't make sense because it would mean \( 0 = 64 \), which is wrong. So, let's use the fact that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool directly.

If the small pool has \( S \) gallons now, the big pool has \( 4S \) gallons now. And since the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation:

"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to add up the cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. So, we add these amounts together:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori needs $352.00 to buy both the shoes and the belt. Her job pays her $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn $352.00. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an extra 10% of that amount. First, we need to find out how much extra she has to pay.

The extra amount is 10% of $2000, which is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Now, Janeth is paying $165 every month for 12 months. So, the total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

To find out how much she still owes after 12 months, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. The problem also tells us there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, to find out how many dahlias there are, we add 7 to the number of roses:

\[ 4 \text{ roses} + 7 = 11 \text{ dahlias} \]

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together:

\[ 4 \text{ roses} + 11 \text{ dahlias} = 15 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know Harriet is 21 years old now. 

1. **Zack's age:**
   - Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack is twice Harriet's age.
   - Zack's age = 2 × 21 = 42 years old.

2. **Adrian's age:**
   - Adrian is three times Harriet's age.
   - Adrian's age = 3 × 21 = 63 years old.

Now, let's find out their ages in three years:
- Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years.
- Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years.
- Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years.

To find the average age in three years, we add their ages together and divide by 3:
- Total age in three years = 24 + 45 + 66 = 135 years.
- Average age = 135 ÷ 3 = 45 years.

So, the average age of the three in three years is 45 years. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, let's break it down step by step:

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half of what Naomi scored. So, we calculate half of Naomi's score:
   \[
   \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   Then add 10 to that:
   \[
   34 + 10 = 44
   \]
   So, Yuri scored 44 points.
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's score:
   \[
   68 + 17 = 85
   \]
   So, Brianna scored 85 points.

Now, we know the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
- Naomi: 68 points
- Yuri: 44 points
- Brianna: 85 points

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, Jojo's score can be found by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[
251 - (68 + 44 + 85) = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

Therefore, Jojo scored 54 points. The correct answer is \(\boxed{54}\)."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time she spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles.

First, let's calculate the time she spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes her 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time she spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes her 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.

So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both puzzles:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is 70 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden, so the tank has:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Then, she collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank, the total amount of water in the tank now is:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Andy plants 90 geraniums. He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, so he plants:
\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]
petunias.

Now, to find out how many flowers he plants in total, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:
\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers. The final answer is:
\[ 140 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

In the first year, the company spent $15000 on advertising.

For the second year, they spent a third of that amount. To find a third of $15000, we do:
\[ \frac{15000}{3} = 5000 \]

So, in the second year, they spent $5000 on advertising.

Now, to find the total amount spent over the two years, we add the amounts from both years:
\[ 15000 + 5000 = 20000 \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000.

The correct answer is: **$20000**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Carlos and Benji.

First, we calculate how much Carlos pays for renting the canoe. The canoe costs $30 per hour, and Carlos rents it for 3 hours. So, we multiply:

\[ 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars} \]

Next, we calculate how much Benji pays for renting the banana boat raft. The raft costs $18 per hour, and Benji rents it for 5 hours. So, we multiply:

\[ 18 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, we add the amounts Carlos and Benji pay together to find the total cost:

\[ 90 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars} = 180 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is $180. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{180} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. The trip back from Rochester to New Jersey by car takes half as many days as the trip there. So, the trip back by car takes \(6 \div 2 = 3\) days.

Now, if Andrew goes to Rochester by bus and then returns by car, we need to add the days for both trips together:
- 6 days (to Rochester by bus)
- 3 days (back by car)

So, the total number of days he will travel is \(6 + 3 = 9\) days.

The final answer is 9 days."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

James starts with:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

He loses 8 water type cards, so he has:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ water type cards} \]

He also buys 14 more grass type cards, so he now has:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \text{ grass type cards} \]

Now, let's add up all the cards he has:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ total cards} \]

We need to find what percentage of these cards are water type. The number of water type cards is 32 out of 96 total cards. To find the percentage, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

So:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounding 33.33% to the nearest integer gives us 33%.

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33%.

The final answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Chad starts with a base burrito that costs $6.50. Then he adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and two sauces at $0.25 each. So, the cost of the extra items is:

- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- Two sauces: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Chad then decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, which includes chips and a drink. Adding this to the previous total:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00 that he uses at checkout. Subtracting the value of the gift card from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

So, the amount Chad still owes is $9.00.

The final answer is: **$9.00**"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda, so her mom can place 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes is the same as 1 hour.

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

First, we find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest. The farm produced 120 watermelons, and 30% of them were ready. To find 30% of 120, we do:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

So, 36 watermelons were ready and Ashlyn took them home. This means there were:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

watermelons left.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready. To find out how many were ready, we do:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

So, 63 watermelons were ready. This means the number of watermelons that were not ready is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. First, we need to find out how much all the cars cost together.

\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

So, the cars cost $240,000 in total. Now, Mark has to pay 10% tax on these cars. To find out how much the tax is, we calculate 10% of $240,000.

\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

So, the tax is $24,000. Now, we add the tax to the cost of the cars to get the total cost before registration.

\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

Next, Mark has to pay $1000 for registration on each car. Since he has 12 cars, the total registration cost is:

\[ 12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \]

Now, we add the registration cost to the total cost before registration to get the final amount Mark pays.

\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the final amount Mark pays is $276,000.

The correct answer is: **$276,000**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On Monday, Robert collected 20 shells. Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so she collected:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ shells} \]

On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. So, we need to multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2:
\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \text{ shells} \]

Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden. If there were 50 ants, then the number of bugs would be half of 50, which is 25.

So, we have 50 ants and 25 bugs. To find the total number of insects, we add these two numbers together:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75.

The correct answer is 75."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We start with 36 penguins sunbathing in the snow.

1. One-third of them jump into the ocean. To find out how many that is, we do:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

2. Another one-third go into the cave to eat dinner. Again, we do:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
   \]
   So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, we add the penguins that went into the ocean and the cave:
\[
12 + 12 = 24
\]
So, 24 penguins are not sunbathing anymore.

To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we subtract the number that went into the ocean and the cave from the total number of penguins:
\[
36 - 24 = 12
\]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day. His girlfriend eats half of that, so she eats 3 tomatoes a day. Together, they eat:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate how many tomatoes they eat in a week:

\[ 9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes a week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide the total number of tomatoes they eat in a week by the number of tomatoes one vine produces:

\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To figure out how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza are needed in total. John has 20 friends, and each friend wants 4 slices. So, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices each friend wants:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas John needs, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas. The final answer is:

10"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Ram starts with 25 pens. He can make a new pen by mixing the ink from 5 empty pens. So, if he has 25 pens, he can make:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

new pens. This means he can make 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens he has.

Now, he started with 25 pens and made 5 new ones, so the total number of pens he has now is:

\[ 25 + 5 = 30 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is 30. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{30}\)"
"Johnny started with $20 and added $10 more, so he had $20 + $10 = $30. He then invested this money and it tripled. To find out how much he had after a year, we multiply $30 by 3, which gives us $30 * 3 = $90.

So, the amount of money Johnny had after a year is $90."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler numbers.

We know Jessa is 20 years old.

Joan is five years older than Jessa, so:
\[ \text{Joan's age} = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so:
\[ \text{Mary's age} = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Now, to find the sum of their ages:
\[ \text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 23 = 68 \]

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We start with 1000 students in the hall.
2. 30% of the students went out through exit A. To find out how many that is, we calculate 30% of 1000:
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students went out through exit A.

3. Now, we subtract the 300 students who went out through exit A from the total number of students:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]
   So, 700 students are left.

4. Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find out how many that is, we calculate 3/5 of 700:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students went out through exit B.

5. Now, we subtract the 420 students who went out through exit B from the remaining 700 students:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]
   So, 280 students are left.

These 280 students must have gone out through exit C.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

The final answer is 280."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler numbers to understand it better.

We know John has 54 candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can find out how many candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2.

So, Robert has:
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we add 6 to Robert's candies to find out how many candies James has:
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"

First, let's see how many books Dolly reads:
- Dolly reads her own books: 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's book: 1 book.
- So, Dolly reads a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

Next, let's see how many books Pandora reads:
- Pandora reads her own book: 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's books: 2 books.
- So, Pandora reads a total of \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, if we add up all the books they read together:
- Dolly reads 3 books.
- Pandora reads 3 books.
- So, together they read \(3 + 3 = 6\) books.

"Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he has 3 pen pals left. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. That means each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 3 pen pals in kind, so he also sends 30 pages a week. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we first convert the total number of pages into minutes:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we convert the total minutes into hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to add up all the minutes he's used and then subtract that from his total plan allowance.

First, let's calculate the total minutes Jason uses for his daily calls with his boss. He makes a 15-minute call every day, and there are 30 days in the month, so:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the extra minutes he used for calls to other people, which is 300 minutes. So, the total number of minutes used is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. Therefore, the number of minutes he has left is:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

Griffin started with 24 fries. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had:
\[ 24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries} \]

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries} \]
Now Griffin has:
\[ 19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries} \]

Colby took 3 less than what Kyle took, so Colby took:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries} \]
Now Griffin has:
\[ 9 - 2 = 7 \text{ fries} \]

We know that after all this, Griffin ends up with 27 fries. So, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is:
\[ 27 - 7 = 20 \text{ fries} \]

Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference in the number of snails between these two aquariums is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

The problem says that this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So, if we let the number of fish in each aquarium be \( F \), then the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \). According to the problem:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is 7. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Jean paid for the makeup.

First, we need to find out how many hours the makeup artist works in total. She works 4 times a week and each session takes 6 hours. So, in one week, she works:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

The movie lasts for 5 weeks, so the total number of hours she works is:
\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 for each hour. So, the total cost before any discount is:
\[ 120 \times 250 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Jean gets a 10% discount on the total cost. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $30,000:
\[ 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean pays:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jean paid:
\[ \boxed{27000} \]"
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to add up all the money Isabelle spent on the party supplies. She spent:

- $12 on ingredients for the cake
- $43 on birthday presents
- $15 on decorations
- $4 on invitations
- $22 on goodie bags

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

Isabelle split this total cost evenly among her three parents. So, we need to divide the total cost by 3:
\[ 96 \div 3 = 32 \]

Each person paid $32. 

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:
\[ 4 \times 50 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that each pound of onions costs $1.50. So, to find out how much the chef spent, we multiply the total weight by the cost per pound:
\[ 200 \times 1.50 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the chef spent **300 dollars**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we know how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day:
- On Monday, she ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, she ate 13 cookies.

Now, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many as her sister, so \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many as her sister, so \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we add up how many cookies Sue ate in total:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total for Sue: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Now, we do the same for Sue's sister:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total for Sue's sister: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, we calculate the total calories for each:
- Sue's total calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories
- Sue's sister's total calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract:
- \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister. The answer is \(\boxed{5600}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We know there are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students. So, the total number of students in the school is:
   \[
   20 \times 3 = 60
   \]

2. Since the school has an equal number of boys and girls, there are:
   \[
   \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls}
   \]

3. We know the number of girls in the first and second classes:
   - First class: 15 girls
   - Second class: 12 girls

   So, the total number of girls in the first and second classes is:
   \[
   15 + 12 = 27
   \]

4. Since the total number of girls in the school is 30, the number of girls in the third class is:
   \[
   30 - 27 = 3
   \]

5. Since each class has 20 students, and there are 3 girls in the third class, the number of boys in the third class is:
   \[
   20 - 3 = 17
   \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"Travis started with 61 apps on his tablet. He decided to get rid of some apps he didn't use, so he deleted 9 apps. That means he had:

\[ 61 - 9 = 52 \]

apps left. Then, he added 18 new apps to his tablet. So, the total number of apps now is:

\[ 52 + 18 = 70 \]

So, the total number of apps on his tablet now is 70. 

The correct answer is 70."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, that's a total of:
\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ animals} \]

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed \( c \) cougars today. Then he killed \( 3c \) wolves. We also know he killed 3 fewer cougars than last night, so:
\[ c = 15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars} \]
So, he killed:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ wolves} \]

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

So, the total number of animals he killed is:
\[ 25 + 48 = 73 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is \(\boxed{73}\)."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Bill starts on the 3rd floor. The problem says he rides the elevator to a floor that's 4 times his starting floor plus 6. So, we first find out what 4 times his starting floor is. Since he starts on the 3rd floor, we do:

\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Now, we add 6 to this number:

\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \]

So, Bill ends up on the 18th floor. 

The final answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mitchell went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchell. To find out how many times Anne went down, we first calculate 30% of 30, which is 9. So, we subtract 9 from 30 to find out how many times Anne went down:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \]

So, Anne went down the slide 21 times. Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as many times as Anne did. So, we multiply 21 by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the slide 84 times. The answer is 84."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows is:
\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Then, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. The total number of cows now is:
\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

These 40 new cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:
\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we want to know how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, the number of cows in 8 stalls is:
\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 16. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank.

First, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill:

1. **Pennies:**
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - So, the total value of the pennies is \(100 \times 0.01 = 1.00\) dollars.

2. **Nickels:**
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - So, the total value of the nickels is \(40 \times 0.05 = 2.00\) dollars.

3. **Dimes:**
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - So, the total value of the dimes is \(20 \times 0.10 = 2.00\) dollars.

4. **Dollar Bills:**
   - Brady has 40 pieces of dollar bills.
   - Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.
   - So, the total value of the dollar bills is \(40 \times 1.00 = 40.00\) dollars.

Now, we add up all these values to find the total amount of money:

\[1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00\]

So, Brady has a total of $45.00 in his piggy bank. The correct answer is \(\boxed{45.00}\)."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

We have a redwood tree that is 200 feet tall. Each 10-foot section of the tree weighs 400 pounds. First, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in the 200-foot tree.

\[
\text{Number of sections} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the tree before any damage is:

\[
\text{Total weight} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, so 70% of the tree remains. To find out how much the tree weighs after the termites ate, we calculate 70% of the total weight:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate is 5600 pounds. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Nancy has 8 books that are overdue. For each book, she owes $0.50. So, for 8 books, she owes:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Also, she has to pay a flat fee of $2.00 because she has at least one book that's over a week overdue. So, we add the flat fee to the cost of the books:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Andrea has 52 apples. The problem tells us that Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal must have \(52 - 8 = 44\) apples.

Next, the problem says Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, Jamal must have \(44 + 4 = 48\) bananas.

Now, we know Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. Since Jamal has 48 bananas, Andrea must have \(48 / 2 = 24\) bananas.

So, Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, and Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas.

To find the total number of fruits, we add up all the fruits:
- Andrea's apples: 52
- Andrea's bananas: 24
- Jamal's apples: 44
- Jamal's bananas: 48

Total fruits = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168

So, the total number of fruits is 168. The correct answer is 168."
"To figure out how many cups of flour Carla needs, we first need to know how many cookies she's making in total. She's making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is:

\[36 + 30 = 66\]

Now, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make 12 cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a simple ratio:

\[\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}\]

To solve for \(x\), we can cross-multiply and divide:

\[x = \frac{2 \times 66}{12} = \frac{132}{12} = 11\]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to make 66 cookies. The answer is:

\[\boxed{11}\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have 9,300 pennies in a cup. We need to find out how many pennies are in a stack that has two-thirds of the pennies in the cup.

First, we calculate two-thirds of 9,300 pennies:
\[ 9300 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6200 \text{ pennies} \]

Now, we need to convert these pennies into dollars. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100:
\[ 6200 \div 100 = 62 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total dollar amount in the stack is 62 dollars.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{62}

The final answer is 270."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Chris has 6 trees in his yard.

Ferdinand has half the number of trees Chris has. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has. So, we first find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
Then we add 5 to that:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
\[ 11 - 3 = 8 \]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ 100 + 25 = 125 \]
Samantha has $125.

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ 125 + 50 = 175 \]
Daisy has $175.

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their money together:

"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Mrs. Cruz wants to buy a house that doesn't cost more than $400,000. She found a house that costs $350,000. There are two extra costs she has to pay: a 5% brokerage fee and a 12% transfer fee.

First, let's find out how much the brokerage fee is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

Next, let's find out how much the transfer fee is:
\[ 12\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, let's add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price:
\[ 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than what Mrs. Cruz can afford. The answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Mr. Tan sold his house for $400,000. First, we need to find out how much he paid in transfer fees and brokerage fees.

1. **Transfer fees:**
   - These are 3% of $400,000.
   - To find 3% of $400,000, we calculate \( 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000 \).
   - So, the transfer fees are $12,000.

2. **Brokerage fees:**
   - These are 5% of $400,000.
   - To find 5% of $400,000, we calculate \( 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000 \).
   - So, the brokerage fees are $20,000.

Now, we add the transfer fees and brokerage fees to find the total expenses:
- Total expenses = $12,000 (transfer fees) + $20,000 (brokerage fees) = $32,000.

Next, we subtract the total expenses from the selling price to find the net proceeds from the sale:
- Net proceeds from sale = $400,000 (selling price) - $32,000 (total expenses) = $368,000.

Finally, Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount. So, we subtract this from the net proceeds:
- Net proceeds = $368,000 (net proceeds from sale) - $250,000 (loan repayment) = $118,000.

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{118000}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.
2. To heat the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes. So, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
   \[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]
   Adding this to the 20 minutes, we get:
   \[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]
3. After heating the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil. So, we subtract 5 minutes from the 28 minutes:
   \[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]
4. Now, we add up all the times:
   \[ 20 \text{ (heating to 300 degrees)} + 28 \text{ (heating to 400 degrees)} + 23 \text{ (cooking)} = 71 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is 71 minutes. 

The final answer is: 71 minutes."

The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad and bought 50 newspaper ads. So, the total cost for the newspaper ads is:
\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the agent spent $75 on each television ad and bought 15 television ads. So, the total cost for the television ads is:
\[ 75 \times 15 = 1125 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total amount spent on all the ads, we add the cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads together:
\[ 250 + 1125 = 1375 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount spent by the real estate agent is $1375."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

A juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of these balls are golf balls, so we divide 16 by 2 to find out how many golf balls there are:
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]
So, there are 8 golf balls.

Now, half of these golf balls are blue. So, we take the 8 golf balls and divide them by 2 to find out how many are blue:
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \]
So, there are 4 blue golf balls.

The number of blue golf balls is 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Mary has 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, to find the total number of M&Ms, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762.

The final answer is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John has 2 houses. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, in one house, the number of windows in the bedrooms is:
\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows} \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
\[ 6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows} \]

Each house also has 4 windows that are not connected to the bedrooms. So, for both houses, the total number of these additional windows is:
\[ 4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows together:
\[ 12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

So, the total number of windows between the two houses is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The mother buys three things:
- Cocoa costs $4.20
- Laundry costs $9.45
- Pasta costs $1.35

First, we add these costs together:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 \]

Adding $4.20 and $9.45:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65 \]

Then, adding $1.35 to $13.65:
\[ 13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:
\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is $5.00.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we know the total stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the body's stitches, so that's \(900 \div 10 = 90\) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so that's \(90 \times 2 = 180\) stitches.

Now, let's add up the stitches for the collar and the rosette:
\[90 + 180 = 270\]

This means the body and the collar and rosette together take \(900 + 270 = 1170\) stitches.

So, the stitches left for the two sleeves are:
\[1800 - 1170 = 630\]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the remaining stitches by 2:
\[630 \div 2 = 315\]

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches. The answer is \(\boxed{315}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, the total cost for the tomato seeds is:

Next, she bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. So, the total cost for the celery seeds is:
\[ 80 \times 30 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much money she used in total, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds:
\[ 800 + 2400 = 3200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:
\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how many lines Sean has to memorize.

First, we know the solo song has 54 lines. So, that's 54 lines right there.

Next, the first scene has twice as many lines as the solo song. So, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 54 = 108 \]
This means the first scene has 108 lines. But only a third of these lines are Sean's lines. So, we find a third of 108:
\[ \frac{108}{3} = 36 \]
So, Sean has to memorize 36 lines from the first scene.

Now, the second scene has six more lines than the solo song. So, we add 6 to the 54 lines of the solo song:
\[ 54 + 6 = 60 \]
This means the second scene has 60 lines. But only four-fifths of these lines are Sean's lines. So, we find four-fifths of 60:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \]
So, Sean has to memorize 48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 \text{ (solo song)} + 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} = 138 \]

So, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines. The final answer is \(\boxed{138}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Carly started with 80 cards. First, we find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32
\]

So, 32 cards had the letter A. This leaves us with:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = \frac{120}{8} = 15
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
24 - 15 = 9
\]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D on them is 9.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"To find out how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

So, the time for the small holes is:
\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

So, the time for the large holes is:
\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Okay, let's think about this step by step.

Mico and Marco's current ages add up to 20. So, if we want to know what their ages will be in 10 years, we need to add 10 years to each of their current ages.

If Mico is \( M \) years old now, in 10 years he will be \( M + 10 \) years old.
If Marco is \( R \) years old now, in 10 years he will be \( R + 10 \) years old.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ M + R + 10 + 10 = M + R + 20 \]

We know from the problem that \( M + R = 20 \). So, we can substitute 20 for \( M + R \):
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Let's solve the problem step by step.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. So if Sam's age is \( S \), then Ruby's age is \( 6S \).

The problem also tells us that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, in 9 years, Sam's age will be \( S + 9 \) and Ruby's age will be \( 6S + 9 \). According to the problem, at that time, Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so we can write the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, expand the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Next, we need to get all the \( S \) terms on one side and the numbers on the other side. Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 6S - 3S + 9 = 27 \]
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Now, subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. So, the cost for the popsicles is:
\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. So, the cost for the ice cream bars is:
\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Peter paid is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know that each cobra has 70 spots. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba must have half the spots of a cobra. So, a mamba has:

\[ 70 \div 2 = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we have 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. So, the total number of spots for all the cobras is:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

Next, we have 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. So, the total number of spots for all the mambas is:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we add the total spots of all the cobras and mambas together:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

Finally, we need to find half of the total spots:

\[ 4900 \div 2 = 2450 \text{ spots} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2450}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Maddy is buying pizza for a soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests. So, we need to find out how many people in total will be eating the pizza.

First, we calculate the number of guests:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests} \]

Now, we add the team members and the guests to find the total number of people:
\[ 12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Each pizza can serve 3 people. To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15. So, to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of pizzas by the cost of each pizza:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Maddy will spend:
\[ \boxed{195} \text{ dollars} \]"
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know that each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and she uses 8 of them. So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. So, the length left for the sterling silver beads is:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find out how many beads fit into the 17 inches, we divide:
   \[
   \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads}
   \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace. The answer is 68."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. In the second week, she wrote twice as many, so that's \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.

Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. In the second week, he wrote twice as many, so that's \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.

Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. In the second week, she wrote twice as many, so that's \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Now, let's add up all the stories they wrote in the first week:
- Alani: 20 stories
- Braylen: 40 stories
- Margot: 60 stories
Total for the first week: \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) stories.

Next, let's add up all the stories they wrote in the second week:
- Alani: 40 stories
- Braylen: 80 stories
- Margot: 120 stories
Total for the second week: \(40 + 80 + 120 = 240\) stories.

Now, we add the totals from the first and second weeks:
Total number of stories: \(120 + 240 = 360\) stories.

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Ann is 9 years old. Her brother is twice her age, so we calculate her brother's age by doing:

\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

So, Ann's brother is 18 years old now. To find out how old he will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]

Therefore, in 3 years, Ann's brother will be 21 years old. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{21}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. So, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Now, let's add the value of the quarters and the dimes together:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Kelly buys a can of pop that costs 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount of money she has:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, Kelly will have 90 cents left. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many rows of 5 stars there are on the flag, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the flag has a total of 76 stars. It has 3 rows with 8 stars each and 2 rows with 6 stars each. We need to calculate how many stars these rows have in total and then subtract that from the total number of stars to find out how many stars are in the rows of 5 stars.

1. Calculate the total number of stars in the rows of 8 stars:
   \[
   3 \text{ rows} \times 8 \text{ stars/row} = 24 \text{ stars}
   \]

2. Calculate the total number of stars in the rows of 6 stars:
   \[
   2 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ stars/row} = 12 \text{ stars}
   \]

3. Add the stars from the rows of 8 and 6 stars together:
   \[
   24 \text{ stars} + 12 \text{ stars} = 36 \text{ stars}
   \]

4. Subtract the total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars from the total number of stars on the flag to find out how many stars are in the rows of 5 stars:
   \[
   76 \text{ stars} - 36 \text{ stars} = 40 \text{ stars}
   \]

5. Now, to find out how many rows of 5 stars there are, we divide the number of stars in the rows of 5 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{40 \text{ stars}}{5 \text{ stars/row}} = 8 \text{ rows}
   \]

So, the number of rows of 5 stars is 8. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 80 flagstones, and each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. So, the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, each truck can carry 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks we need, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

So, we need 3 trucks to transport all the flagstones in one trip.

The number of trucks needed is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour and it traveled 480 miles. To find out how long it took, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

So, for the fast lane:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the fast lane, so its speed is:

\[
\text{Speed}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

To find out how long it took the car in the slow lane to travel the same 480 miles, we use the same formula:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the 480 miles. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so:
\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]
So, together they have:
\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]
medals.

The problem says that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. So we calculate:
\[ 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:
\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. There are 8 packets, and each packet has 5 chocolate bars.

\[ 8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many chocolate bars the adults get. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

\[ 4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

Now, we subtract the chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many are left for the children.

\[ 40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars} \]

There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them.

\[ \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child} \]

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

But she takes a 30-minute break, so the time she actually works is 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns per minute, we divide $5 by 10, which gives us $0.5 per minute.

Now, to find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we multiply 150 by $0.5. So, 150 * $0.5 = $75.

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns for the online task is $75."
"Okay, let's go through the problem step by step again, but in a simpler way.

In the first three rounds:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, in the fourth round:
- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

So, after the fourth round:
- Mike has \(21 + 0 = 21\) points.
- Jim has \(18 + 0 = 18\) points.
- Tony has \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, let's add up all their points:
\[21 + 18 + 43 = 82\]

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{82}\)."
"Will buys 15 oranges. He asks his two sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 4 years old.

The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. So, the total number of oranges washed is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

Now, we subtract the number of oranges washed from the total number of oranges Will bought:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the number of oranges left unwashed is 3. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for the first day and the second day.

**First Day:**
- Darren did 100 pushups.
- He did 50 squats.
- He did 20 dumbbell presses.

**Second Day:**
- He did 20 more pushups than the first day, so that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups.
- He did 10 fewer squats than the first day, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 squats.
- He doubled the number of dumbbell presses, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

Now, let's add up the total for each activity over the two days:

**Total Pushups:**
- First day: 100
- Second day: 120
- Total: 100 + 120 = 220

**Total Squats:**
- First day: 50
- Second day: 40
- Total: 50 + 40 = 90

**Total Dumbbell presses:**
- First day: 20
- Second day: 40
- Total: 20 + 40 = 60

Now, let's add up all the totals:

**Total count of activities:**
- Pushups: 220
- Squats: 90
- Dumbbell presses: 60
- Total: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

So, the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days is 370."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice for lunch and dinner, so that's 2 kg of rice per day for the whole family. There are 5 people in the family, and they eat every lunch and dinner, so:

- Lunch: 0.2 kg/person
- Dinner: 0.2 kg/person

So, for one day, the family eats:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of rice by the amount they eat in a day:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how many weeks 21 days is by dividing 21 by 7:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, let's break it down step by step.

Sam's target is to sell 120 crates in a week. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so those days don't count. Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates, on Wednesday, he sold 12 crates, and on Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

First, let's add up the crates sold from Tuesday to Thursday:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 \]

Next, we add the crates sold over the weekend:
\[ 45 + 20 = 65 \]

Now, we know Sam sold 65 crates in total. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

So, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much John pays a year for driving.

First, we need to find out how many miles John drives in a year. He drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back home each day. So, that's 60 miles per day. He does this 5 days a week and there are 50 weeks in a year. So, we calculate the total miles like this:

\[ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 1500 \text{ miles/year} \]

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to drive these miles. The driving service charges $2 per mile. So, we multiply the total miles by the cost per mile:

\[ 1500 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 3000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Now, we need to add the bonus. John gets a $150 bonus each month. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the miles driven to the bonus to find the total cost:

\[ 3000 \text{ dollars/year} + 1800 \text{ dollars/year} = 4800 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the total amount John pays a year for driving is $4800. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{4800}\)."
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to add the time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. So, we add these two times together:

\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount of time on Tuesday. So, we multiply 39 by 2:

\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"To figure out how many pieces of paper are needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's think about how we fold the paper and print the pages.

When we fold a piece of paper vertically, we can print 4 pages on it. Here's how:
- The first page goes on the left back.
- The second page goes on the left front.
- The third page goes on the right back.
- The fourth page goes on the right front.

So, each piece of paper can print 4 pages. Now, we need to print 32 pages in total. To find out how many pieces of paper we need, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages we can print on one piece of paper:

\[
\frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper}
\]

So, we need 8 pieces of paper to print a 32-page tabloid. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Annika had $50 to spend at the town fair. She first spent half of it on food and snacks. Half of $50 is $25. So, she spent $25 on food and snacks.

After that, she spent an extra $10 on rides.

Now, let's add up all the money she spent:
- Money spent on food and snacks: $25
- Money spent on rides: $10

Total money spent = $25 + $10 = $35

Now, we subtract the total money spent from the money she originally had:
- Money she originally had: $50
- Total money spent: $35

Money left = $50 - $35 = $15

So, the amount of money Annika has left is $15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Elise has 250 books in total.
2. There are 50 books that are not sold yet.
3. So, the number of books that are sold is \(250 - 50 = 200\).
4. This year, she sold 45 books.
5. In the first year, she sold twice as many books as she sold this year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books.
6. The total number of books sold over the three years is \(90 + 45 + 45 = 180\) books, but since she only had 250 books, this means she sold all the books over the three years.

Now, to find out how much money she earned in the second year, we need to calculate the money from selling 45 books at $20 each.

So, the money earned in the second year is:
\[ 45 \times 20 = 900 \]

The total amount of money she earned in the second year is $900.

The final answer is: $900"
"To find out how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings step by step.

First, let's figure out how much Watson earns in a week. He works 10 hours a day and gets paid $10 per hour. So, his daily earnings are:

\[ 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Since he works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Watson also gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well. So, his total weekly earnings are:

\[ 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

April has 30 days, and since he works 5 days a week, the number of full weeks in April is:

\[ \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \]

So, we consider only 4 full weeks in April. His total earnings for these 4 weeks are:

\[ 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 800 \, \text{\$/week} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Since the company performed very well for the whole month, he gets the $300 bonus for each of these 4 weeks. So, his total bonus for April is:

\[ 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 1200 \, \text{\$} \]

Adding his total earnings and the total bonus gives us his total earnings for April:

\[ 3200 \, \text{\$} + 1200 \, \text{\$} = 4400 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:

\[ \boxed{4400} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

John played arm wrestling with 20 people. He beat 80% of them. To find out how many he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:
\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]
So, John beat 16 people.

Now, to find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he played against:
\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, John lost to 4 people.

The number of people John lost to is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day. In the morning, they sell two-thirds of these loaves. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

This means 40 loaves are sold in the morning. Now, we need to find out how many loaves are left:

\[
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, they sell half of the remaining loaves. So, we take half of the 20 loaves:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10. 

So, the answer is \boxed{10}."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. So, to find out how much Joey loses in one week, we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \div 4 \text{ weeks} = 2 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Now, Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, which is 2 pounds. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy also needs to lose 2 pounds in one week. We know that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, which is the same as Joey's weekly loss over 4 weeks.

So, if Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds (which is the same as Joey's weekly loss) is:
\[ 4 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much you will save.

First, we look at the ice cream:
- The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13.
- Now, it's sold at $11.
- So, the savings on one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

Since you're buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4.

Next, we look at the milk:
- The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- So, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- Since you're buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2.

Now, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6.

So, the total amount you will save is $6."
"To figure out how many new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after 15 days, we need to count how many times the person gets an extra arm and an extra leg during that time.

First, let's look at the extra arms:
- The person gets an extra arm every 3 days.
- In 15 days, we can divide 15 by 3 to see how many times this happens.
- \(15 \div 3 = 5\)
- So, the person gets 5 extra arms in 15 days.

Next, let's look at the extra legs:
- The person gets an extra leg every 5 days.
- In 15 days, we can divide 15 by 5 to see how many times this happens.
- \(15 \div 5 = 3\)
- So, the person gets 3 extra legs in 15 days.

Now, to find the total number of new limbs, we add the extra arms and extra legs together:
- Extra arms: 5
- Extra legs: 3
- Total new limbs: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

So, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much Theo spends on the business suits and suitcases.

- He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so that's \(6 \times 100 = 600\) dollars.
- He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so that's \(3 \times 50 = 150\) dollars.

Now, let's add the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, 5 times that is \(5 \times 100 = 500\) dollars. So, the flight ticket costs \(500 + 700 = 1200\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
- Business suits: $600
- Suitcases: $150
- Flight ticket: $1200

So, the total cost for these items is \(600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950\) dollars.

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on other things is \(6000 - 2000 = 4000\) dollars.

Now, we subtract the cost of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the amount he can spend:
- \(4000 - 1950 = 2050\) dollars.

So, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have a family of 5 people. Three of them eat 3 eggs each day, and the other two eat 2 eggs each day.

First, let's find out how many eggs the three people eat in a day:
- Each of the three people eats 3 eggs, so together they eat \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.

Next, let's find out how many eggs the other two people eat in a day:
- Each of the two people eats 2 eggs, so together they eat \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add these together to find out how many eggs the whole family eats in a day:
- Total eggs per day = Eggs eaten by the three people + Eggs eaten by the two people
- Total eggs per day = \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, to find out how many eggs they eat in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily total by 7:
- Total eggs per week = Total eggs per day \(\times\) 7
- Total eggs per week = \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

So, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know that Quinn is 30 years old. Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so we subtract 3 from 30 to find out how old Jane is:
\[ 30 - 3 = 27 \]
So, Jane is 27 years old.

Now, Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we add 5 to Jane's age to find out how old Trent is:
\[ 27 + 5 = 32 \]
So, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. **Cera's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Cera is 46 years old now.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.

2. **Noah's Age Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

3. **Noah's Current Age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah is now \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

4. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let's say the current population of Chile is \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population was \(P / 2\).

5. **Population of Chile Six Years Ago in Terms of Noah's Age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - So, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).
   - This means \(P / 2 = 60000\).
   - Therefore, \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

6. **Current Population of Chile:**
   - Since the population six years ago was 120000, the current population is \(120000 \times 2 = 240000\).

So, the population of Chile now is \(\boxed{240000}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the total number of players on the team is 105. We also know that the number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, and the number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \).

Then the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) (since it's twice the number on the defense).

And the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \) (since it's half the number on the defense).

So, the total number of players is the sum of these:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier, let's combine the terms on the left side:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So, we have:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To find \( D \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people.
She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 people.
So, in total, she invited 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, 8 people couldn't come because they were sick.
And 1/4 of those 8 people couldn't come because of previous commitments.
So, 1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

That means in total, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't come to the party.

So, the number of people who showed up is 24 - 10 = 14.

Therefore, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is 14.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. He also got 2/5 times as many marbles from his father. First, we need to find out how many marbles his father gave him.

To find out how many marbles his father gave him, we calculate:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]
So, his father gave him 8 marbles.

Now, we add the marbles Solomon bought from Johanna to the marbles his father gave him:
\[
20 + 8 = 28
\]
So, Solomon has 28 marbles in total.

Each marble weighs 2 kg. To find the total weight of the marbles, we multiply the number of marbles by the weight of each marble:
\[
28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ kg}
\]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is 56 kg. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is shaped like a rectangular box, and the volume of a rectangular box is found by multiplying its length, width, and height.

The pool's length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the depth (height) is 5 feet. So, we calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 24 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it costs $0.1 to fill each cubic foot. So, to find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know there are 30 boys in the classroom. The problem tells us there are 3 times as many girls as boys. So, we can find out how many girls there are by multiplying the number of boys by 3:

\[ 30 \times 3 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 girls in the classroom.

Next, the problem says there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. To find out how many nongendered children there are, we divide the number of boys by 10:

\[ 30 \div 10 = 3 \]

So, there are 3 nongendered children in the classroom.

Now, to find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

\[ 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123.

The correct answer is 123."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. If we have 45 wires, we need to find out how many poles we have.

Since the ratio is 1:3, we can think of it like this: if we have 3 parts for wires, we have 1 part for poles. So, if 3 parts equal 45 wires, then 1 part (which is the number of poles) would be:

\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

So, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The correct answer is: **15**"
"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total people initially: \(25 + 15 = 40\)

2. **After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left:**
   - Number of people who left: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)
   - Number of people remaining: \(40 - 10 = 30\)

3. **Given that 22 men stayed at the party:**
   - Number of men who left: \(25 - 22 = 3\)
   - Number of women who left: \(10 - 3 = 7\) (since 10 people left in total and 3 were men, the rest must be women)

4. **Number of women remaining:**
   - Initial number of women: 15
   - Number of women who left: 7
   - Number of women remaining: \(15 - 7 = 8\)

So, the number of women left at the party is 8.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{8}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the book costs $4. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so we calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

So, the magazine costs $2.

Now, the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Therefore, we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine to find the cost of the pen:
\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

So, the pen costs $1.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Jam has 26 pencils in total. These pencils are in three boxes and two loose pencils. So, if we add the pencils in the boxes and the loose pencils together, we get:
\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]
This means each box has 8 pencils.

Now, we know Meg has 46 pencils. So, the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together is:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Each box can hold 8 pencils. To find out how many boxes they need, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ 72 \div 8 = 9 \]

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To figure out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to think about two things: how the ice cubes cool the coffee and how the cream affects the drink.

First, let's look at the cooling. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need to divide 65 by 13:
\[ 65 \div 13 = 5 \]
So, Shannon needs 5 ice cubes to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, so 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Now, let's think about the cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream doesn't change how much weaker the coffee is in terms of milliliters. It just adds more liquid to the drink.

So, the total reduction in milliliters due to the cooling is 60 milliliters. The addition of cream doesn't affect this number.

Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 60 milliliters weaker. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we need to find out how many old records they brought in.

First, we need to figure out how many old records are needed to get 7 new records. Since 2 old records make 1 new record, we can set up the following:

\[ 2 \text{ old records} = 1 \text{ new record} \]

So, to get 7 new records, we need:

\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ old records} \]

This means that to get 7 new records, 14 old records are needed. Since 5 people are trading, and they all end up with 7 new records, the total number of old records they brought in is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The company has 100 people working there. We know that 40 of them are junior programmers and the rest are senior programmers. So, the number of senior programmers is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Each junior programmer gets $2000 a month. So, the total money paid to all junior programmers is:
\[ 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Each senior programmer gets $400 more than a junior programmer, so they get:
\[ 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]
So, the total money paid to all senior programmers is:
\[ 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Now, to find out how much the company pays in total to all the programmers, we add the money paid to junior programmers and senior programmers:
\[ 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is:
\[ \boxed{224000} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. At the start, let's say \( x \) people got on the bus at the terminal.
2. At the first stop, 5 more people got on. So now the number of people on the bus is \( x + 5 \).
3. At the second stop, 7 people got off and 8 more people got on. So the number of people on the bus becomes \( (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \).
4. We know that after the second stop, there were 20 people on the bus. So we can set up the equation: \( x + 6 = 20 \).
5. To find \( x \), we solve the equation: \( x = 20 - 6 = 14 \).

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14.

The answer is: \(\boxed{14}\)"
"Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

The final answer is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we need to figure out how much more charging is needed and then convert that into minutes and then hours.

The phone needs to go from 60% to 100%, which means it needs to charge 40 more percentage points.

We know that the phone charges 1 percentage point every 3 minutes. So, to charge 40 percentage points, we multiply 40 by 3 minutes:

\[
40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to convert 120 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 120 by 60:

\[
120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Then her mom gives her 10 more, so she has:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final answer is 14."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a shopping trip where the customer spent $43.

1. **Calculate the rewards earned:**
   - For every $20 spent, the customer gets $1 off their next purchase.
   - If they spent $80, they would get:
     \[
     \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards}
     \]
   - So, they earned 4 rewards.

2. **Determine the rewards used:**
   - They used these 4 rewards on this shopping trip.

3. **Calculate the discount from the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.
   - So, the discount is:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Compute the final price:**
   - They spent $43.
   - After using the rewards, the price becomes:
     \[
     43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - After applying the coupon discount, the price becomes:
     \[
     39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}

So, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Job A and Job B to see which one Nick will make more money from.

### Job A:
- Nick works 2000 hours a year.
- He gets paid $15 per hour.
- So, his total pay before tax is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.
- The state has a 20% tax rate.
- The tax he has to pay is 20% of $30,000, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000.
- So, his net pay after tax is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

### Job B:
- Nick gets paid $42,000 a year.
- The state charges $6,000 in property tax.
- So, his net income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
- The state also charges a 10% tax on his net income after property tax.
- The tax he has to pay is 10% of $36,000, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.
- So, his net pay after all taxes is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's see how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job:
- Job B's net pay is $32,400.
- Job A's net pay is $24,000.
- The difference is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate. The final answer is $8,400."
"To find out how many unmanned ruined castles there are in Scotland, we can break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many castles are ruined. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruined.
   - 40 percent of 220 is calculated as \(0.40 \times 220 = 88\).
   - So, there are 88 ruined castles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned.
   - Half of 88 is calculated as \(0.50 \times 88 = 44\).
   - So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles.

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44.

The correct answer is 44."
"To find out the cost difference between the two offers, let's first calculate the total cost for each offer.

**Furniture United's Offer:**
- They ask for a $1,350 advance payment.
- Then, they ask for 6 monthly installments of $350 each.

First, we calculate the total amount for the installments:
\[ 6 \times 350 = 2100 \]

Now, we add the advance payment to the total installments:
\[ 1350 + 2100 = 3450 \]

So, the total cost for Furniture United's offer is $3,450.

**Cozy Homes' Offer:**
- They ask for a $1,100 advance payment.
- Then, they ask for 9 monthly installments of $250 each.

First, we calculate the total amount for the installments:
\[ 9 \times 250 = 2250 \]

Now, we add the advance payment to the total installments:
\[ 1100 + 2250 = 3350 \]

So, the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer is $3,350.

**Cost Difference:**
\[ 3450 - 3350 = 100 \]

The cost difference between the two offers is $100.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have four people: Nick, Richard, Jason (DJ), and RJ. We need to find out how many paintball guns each person would have if they share them equally.

First, let's add up all the guns:
- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, they have a total of 24 paintball guns. Now, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the four people. To do this, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

So, if they share the guns equally, each person would have 6 guns.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Maria buys 8 shares of a stock at $8 each. So, the total money she spends is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

In the first year, the price of the stock goes up by 50%. So, the new price of each share is:
\[ \$8 + 50\% \times \$8 = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at $12 each. So, the total value of her shares after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the price of the stock goes down by 25%. So, the new price of each share is:
\[ \$12 - 25\% \times \$12 = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at $9 each. So, the total value of her shares after the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:

"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs. Thomas ate three times more than Luke, so we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]
Thomas ate 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so we calculate:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
John ate 3 hot dogs.

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke, we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:
\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The answer is 1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have a class of 200 students split into 3 groups. Two of these groups have the same number of students, and the third group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

Let's say each of the two equal groups has \( x \) students. So, the third group will have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students is 200, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we add 10 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The third group, which is the smallest, will have:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's figure out how many cows and chickens he has.

If we let the number of cows be \( C \), then the number of chickens is \( 2C \) because he has twice as many chickens as cows. The total number of animals is the sum of cows and chickens, so:

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows. Since he has twice as many chickens as cows, he has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
\[ \text{So, he has 40 chickens.} \]

Now, let's count the legs. Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 cows have:

\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]
\[ \text{legs.} \]

Each chicken has 2 legs, so 40 chickens have:

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]
\[ \text{legs.} \]

Adding the legs of the cows and chickens together:

\[ 80 + 80 = 160 \]

So, the total number of legs the animals have is 160. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal.

1. **Pink Frog:**
   - The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

2. **Blue Beetle:**
   - The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it's also 50 pounds.

3. **Green Toad:**
   - The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it's also 50 pounds.

4. **Yellow Snake:**
   - The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. So, if the pink frog is 50 pounds, the yellow snake is 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.

5. **Red Bird:**
   - The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. So, if the pink frog is 50 pounds, the red bird is 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.

Now, let's add up the weights of all these animals and the container:
- Pink Frog: 50 pounds
- Blue Beetle: 50 pounds
- Green Toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow Snake: 60 pounds
- Red Bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Tyson usually runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters each day. So, we first find out how much more he should run:

\[ 5000 \times \frac{1}{5} = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

This means Tyson should run an extra 1000 meters each day. So, his new daily distance is:

\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, if Tyson runs 6000 meters every day for a month (30 days), we can calculate the total distance he runs in June:

\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters. The correct answer is:

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs from the 50 tables that have 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add the legs from both types of tables together:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies each week, and each bag has 36 cookies. So, she has 36 cookies in a week.

She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week. So, she puts \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies in her son's lunch box.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats \(1 \times 7 = 7\) cookies.

Now, we need to find out how many cookies are left for Jenny. We subtract the cookies her son and husband eat from the total number of cookies:

3. There's a 40% discount on these shirts. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 40% of $60:
   \[ 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

4. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Davos paid:
   \[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Davos paid \(\boxed{36}\) dollars for the 2 shirts."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. So, the total money they made each day was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Now, they make silos instead. They sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo. So, the total money they make each day now is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

To find out how much more money they make now compared to before, we subtract the old amount from the new amount:
\[ \$1100/\text{day} - \$1000/\text{day} = \$100/\text{day} \]

Now, to find out what percentage this increase is of the old amount, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New amount} - \text{Old amount}}{\text{Old amount}} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100/\text{day} - \$1000/\text{day}}{\$1000/\text{day}} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100/\text{day}}{\$1000/\text{day}} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \frac{1}{10} \times 100\% = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more money per day now. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to add up the costs of food, treats, and medicine for a year.

First, let's calculate the monthly costs:
- Food costs $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the cost of food per month is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, let's add these up to find the total monthly cost:
\[ 100 \text{ (food)} + 20 \text{ (treats)} + 100 \text{ (medicine)} = 220 \text{ dollars per month} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she spends in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
\[ 220 \text{ dollars per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 2640 \text{ dollars per year} \]

So, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2640} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

- Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
- Tuesday's cooking class is three times as long as Monday's yoga, so that's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours.
- Thursday's museum tour is half the time of the cooking class, so that's \(3 / 2 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[1 \text{ (Monday)} + 3 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 \text{ hours}\]

So, the total number of hours for all Peyton’s after-work activities is 7.5 hours. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{7.5}
\]"
"April needs 30 plant pots for daisies and twice as many for roses, so she needs 60 plant pots for roses. In total, she needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.

April already bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought: 100 - 90 = 10.

So, April has 10 plant pots left over. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Andrea started with $36. She spent some money on a sweater that cost $11 and gave $4 to her brother. So, the total amount she spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the total amount she spent from the money she started with. So, $36 - $15 = $21.

Therefore, Andrea saved $21.

The final answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, so he swims for:
\[ 6 \div 2 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

He also watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long. So, the total time he spends watching shows is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the time he spends on these activities:
\[ 6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. To find the total time \( T \), we use the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know that 40% of his total time is spent sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, Annabelle already has $80 in her savings.

She earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours. So, the money she earns from her first job is:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

At her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours. So, the money she earns from her second job is:
\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money she has:
\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400. To find out how much more money she needs, we subtract the total amount she has from the cost of the phone:
\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, Annabelle still needs to save $45.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so it's \(6 + 5 = 11\) feet tall.
3. The tallest tree is twice the height of the shortest and the second tree combined. The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is \(6 + 11 = 17\) feet.
4. So, the height of the tallest tree is \(2 \times 17 = 34\) feet.

Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet.

The final answer is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dean's mother gave him $28.
2. He bought 6 toy cars, and each car costs $2. So, the total cost for the toy cars is:
   \[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]
3. He also bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. So, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
   \[ 5 \times 1 = 5 \]
4. Now, let's add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears:
   \[ 12 + 5 = 17 \]
5. After buying the toys, Dean has:
   \[ 28 - 17 = 11 \]
6. Then, his mother gives him an extra $10:
   \[ 11 + 10 = 21 \]

So, Dean has $21 left. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Morgan's dad said she has a budget of $90 for her birthday party. She wants to play mini-golf, get some arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice. The cost for mini-golf is $5, arcade tokens cost $5, and each go-kart ride costs $10, and she wants to ride twice. 

First, let's add up the cost of the mini-golf and arcade tokens:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

So, the total cost for these activities is:
\[ 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \]

Now, let's subtract this total cost from her budget to see how much money is left for her friends:
\[ 90 - 30 = 60 \]

With the remaining $60, we can calculate how many friends she can invite. Each go-kart ride costs $10, so:
\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

So, Morgan can invite 6 friends to her birthday party. The answer is 6."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Marisa gets $5 every day from her parents. She spends $1 on lollipops because 4 lollipops at 25 cents each cost $1. So, she saves $4 each day.

Now, if she saves $4 every day for 5 days, we need to find out how much she saves in total. We do this by multiplying $4 by 5:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, Marisa saves $20 in her piggy bank over 5 days. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Billy starts with $10 and buys candy that costs $1.50 per pound. After buying the candy, he spends half of his change on gumballs, which he buys 40 of at 5 cents each.

First, let's find out how much money Billy spends on gumballs. He buys 40 gumballs at 5 cents each, so:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

This $2 is half of the change he has after buying the candy. So, the total change he has is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know that the total money he started with is $10, and after buying the candy, he has $4 left. So, the cost of the candy is:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the candy costs $1.50 per pound, we can find out how many pounds of candy he bought by dividing the total cost of the candy by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Carver is 45 years old. The problem says that Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, if we let the son's age be \( x \), we can write the equation:

\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

Now, we need to find out what \( x \) is. First, we add 5 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -5 on the right side:

\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find out how many days the train goes between services, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete round trip. The train travels:
- 75 miles from the first city to the second city.
- 100 miles from the second city to the third city.
- 125 miles from the third city back to the first city (which is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trip).

So, the total distance for one complete round trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days}\]

Since \(\frac{1}{20}\) of a day is equivalent to 12 hours, the train goes between services every 12 hours. 

So, the train goes between services every 12 hours, which is the same as every 12 hours. 

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed takes. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. The collie bed takes the average of these two amounts:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much stuffing is needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

For the chihuahua beds:
\[
4 \text{ chihuahua beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds per chihuahua bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

For the collie beds:
\[
3 \text{ collie beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds per collie bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these together gives us the total amount of stuffing needed:
\[
8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. The final answer is 23 pounds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the trip John took.

First, John drives 200 miles to his friend's house at a speed of 70 mph. To find out how long this trip takes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to get to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{70} \text{ hours} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Then, he takes a detour that adds 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance 210 miles. The time for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

After getting to his friend's house, he drives home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time for this trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the times:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So,

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls were absent, so the number of girls present is:

\[ 43 - 5 = 38 \]

Since the total number of fourth-graders is 96, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 96 - 38 = 58 - 4 = 54 \]

So, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

\[ 54 \]

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know there are 6 girls in the park. The problem says there are twice as many boys as girls. So, if we take the number of girls (which is 6) and multiply it by 2, we get the number of boys. 

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, there are 12 boys in the park. Now, to find out the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and the number of boys together.

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18. 

The final answer is 18."
"To find out the minimum number of points Jane needs on her third test, we first add the points she scored on her first two tests.

Points on the first test: 15
Points on the second test: 18

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. So, we need to find out how many more points she needs to reach 42 points.

\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. The minimum number of points she must score on the third test is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks. So, \( x = 3 \).

Next, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of those who didn't wear masks minus 5. So, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

Then, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of those who shoplifted. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we add up all the customers kicked out for these reasons:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

The total number of customers kicked out of the Walmart is 50. So, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 19."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Sara scored 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. So, we calculate how many points Erin has after scoring 14 points:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ points}
   \]
3. This 24 points is the total points Erin has after scoring 14 points. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from the 24 points:
   \[
   24 - 14 = 10 \text{ points}
   \]

So, Erin had 10 points before she scored the additional 14 points. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To find out how much will be spent on the senior gifts, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost, so the total cost per frame is $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is **$1198**."
"To find out how much Ethan would pay if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. So, we first calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$400 = 0.20 \times 400 = \$80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. To find the total cost for Ethan, we subtract the savings from the original cost:

\[ \$400 - \$80 = \$320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of pairs they sold on Friday. So, they sold:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On Sunday, they sold half the number of pairs they sold on Saturday. So, they sold:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold over the three days:
\[ 14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 14 \text{ (Sunday)} = 56 \text{ pairs} \]

But, 6 pairs were returned, so we need to subtract those from the total:
\[ 56 - 6 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is 50 pairs. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The company bought $400,000 worth of equipment. Out of this, 40% of the equipment was faulty. We need to find out how much they spent on the good equipment.

First, let's find out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. If 40% were faulty, then 60% were good because 100% - 40% = 60%.

Now, we need to find out what 60% of $400,000 is. To do this, we can calculate it like this:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 400,000 = \frac{60}{100} \times 400,000 \]

\[ = 0.6 \times 400,000 \]

\[ = 240,000 \]

So, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The final answer is: **$240,000**"
"Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, give her 1 kg of milk each day. The other half, also 15 sheep, give her 2 kg of milk each day.

So, the total milk she gets from the first 15 sheep is:
\[ 15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg} \]

And the total milk she gets from the other 15 sheep is:
\[ 15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg} \]

Adding these together gives:
\[ 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg} \]

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We have 40 pupils in the class. Half of them like blue, so:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \]
So, 20 pupils like blue.

Now, we subtract the 20 pupils who like blue from the total:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \]
So, 20 pupils are left.

One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \]
So, 5 pupils like green.

The rest of the pupils like yellow. We subtract the 5 pupils who like green from the 20 remaining pupils:
\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]
So, 15 pupils like yellow.

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday and got $56 from selling them at $4 per apple. To find out how many apples she sold, we divide the total money she got by the price per apple:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

So, Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday.

Next, on Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out how many apples she picked in total over the three days, we add the apples picked on each day:

\[ \text{Total number of apples picked} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which means she washed 10 x 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. She also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks. To find out how many socks she missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks she started with. So, 50 - 35 = 15 socks. Therefore, Lindsay missed 15 socks. The correct answer is:

\boxed{15}"

"To find out how much Karan has to pay each month, we first need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest. The interest rate is 10%, and she borrowed $3,650 for five months.

First, let's calculate the total amount she will owe:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5884.4115 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay each month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5884.4115}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.8823 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.88 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1176.88 each month. The closest option to this amount is:
\[ \boxed{1176.88} \]"
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the distance each person hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

The final answer is: \boxed{67}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so:
\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, let's add up all the silver pesos they have together:
\[ 50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

And for the gold pesos:
\[ 80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is:
\[ 150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

The total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she can make:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

She sells each cup for $1, so if she sells all 36 cups, she makes:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, she spends $18 to make the lemonade, so her profit from selling all the lemonade is:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups, we divide the total cups by the cups sold per hour:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours:
\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2/\text{hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, so he has 2/5 of his land left. We're told that 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares. To find out how much land he had originally, we need to figure out what 1 whole (or 5/5) of his land would be.

If 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares, then 1 whole (5/5) of his land would be:
\[ 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} = 12.8 \times 2.5 = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the choir has 52 members. Since 50% of the members are girls, we can find out how many girls there are by dividing 52 by 2:

\[ 52 \div 2 = 26 \]

So, there are 26 girls in the choir.

Next, the choir decides to perform only with the girls. That means 26 girls are going to perform.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, we need to find out how many girls can still perform:

\[ 26 \div 2 = 13 \]

This means 13 girls can still perform.

Then, the 3 teachers decide to join them. So, we add the 13 girls to the 3 teachers:

\[ 13 + 3 = 16 \]

Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 16.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The scores are 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, let's add up all the test scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Adding these step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests (which is 5) to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To find out how much 6 erasers and 8 pencils cost, we first need to calculate the cost of the erasers and the pencils separately.

An eraser costs $2, so 6 erasers would cost:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

A pencil costs $3, so 8 pencils would cost:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36. 

The correct answer is 36."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. He delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu. So, we need to find out how many messages that is.

To find out how many messages Mr. Yu gets, we do:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, Mr. Yu gets 22 messages.

Now, to find the total number of messages James delivers, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages James delivers is 88.

The final answer is:
\[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for David and Dasha to ride all 9 rides.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30. This ride bracelet gives him 9 rides, so he doesn't need to buy any tickets.

Dasha buys tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. So, for 9 rides, she needs 9 rides * 2 tickets/ride = 18 tickets. Since each ticket costs $2, the total cost for Dasha is 18 tickets * $2/ticket = $36.

Now, we need to find out how much money David saves. Dasha spends $36, and David spends $30. So, David saves $36 - $30 = $6.

Therefore, the amount of money David saves is $6.

The final answer is: **$6**"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Monica wants to wrap gifts for her family, friends, and teachers. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. So, she has a total of:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \text{ gifts} \]

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon to wrap all these gifts. To find out how much ribbon she can use for each gift, we need to divide the total ribbon by the total number of gifts:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and together they have 165 popsicles.

First, let's say Betty has 5 parts and Sam has 6 parts. So, the total parts they have together is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, each part is equal to 165 ÷ 11 = 15 popsicles.

Now, to find out how many popsicles Betty has, we multiply her parts by the value of each part: 5 parts × 15 = 75 popsicles.

And to find out how many popsicles Sam has, we multiply his parts by the value of each part: 6 parts × 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract Betty's popsicles from Sam's popsicles: 90 - 75 = 15.

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The answer is 15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money Tim saves.

Tim used to have a cable package that cost $60 a month. Now, he's switching to streaming services. He gets Netflix for $10 a month. For Hulu and Disney Plus, they normally cost $10 each, but he can get them for $8 each because they're bundled together. Here's how we can figure out the savings:

1. **Cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 a month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus normally:**
   - Each costs $10 a month.
   - So, for both Hulu and Disney Plus, it would normally be $10 + $10 = $20 a month.

3. **Savings on Hulu and Disney Plus:**
   - He saves 20% on the $20, so the savings are $20 * 0.20 = $4.
   - So, the cost for Hulu and Disney Plus after the savings is $20 - $4 = $16 a month.

4. **Total cost of streaming services:**
   - Netflix: $10 a month.
   - Hulu and Disney Plus: $16 a month.
   - So, the total cost for streaming services is $10 + $16 = $26 a month.

5. **Savings from cancelling cable:**
   - Cable package cost: $60 a month.
   - Streaming services cost: $26 a month.
   - So, the savings are $60 - $26 = $34 a month.

Therefore, Tim saves \(\boxed{34}\) dollars a month by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. That's the same as 4 times 60 minutes, which is 240 minutes.

She spends half that time recording it, so that's 240 minutes / 2 = 120 minutes.

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, to find out the total time she spent, we add all these times together:
240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes.

To find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Then:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing is 20%.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. First, we need to find out how many slots there are in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, we multiply these numbers:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

So, there are 36 slots in total. Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of these slots. Let's calculate double the number of slots:

\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 to this number:

\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Erica made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of cards, and each box has 15 cards. So, her dad brought her \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards. Adding the cards Erica made to the cards her dad brought, she has \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards in total.

Now, Erica gave out 24 cards to her classmates and received 17 cards from her family and friends. To find out how many cards she has now, we need to subtract the cards she gave out and add the cards she received:
\[50 - 24 + 17 = 43\]

So, Erica now has 43 cards. The final answer is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Jenny has a pizza with 12 slices.

First, she gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. To find out how many slices that is, we do:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. To find out how many slices that is, we do:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Now, let's add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 \text{ slices} + 3 \text{ slices} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny also eats 2 slices. So, we add those to the slices given away:
\[ 7 \text{ slices} + 2 \text{ slices} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:
\[ 12 \text{ slices} - 9 \text{ slices} = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is 3. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Mark has $50 in his bank account. He earns $10 each day at his job. He needs $300 to buy a bike. To find out how many days he needs to work to earn the extra money, we subtract what he already has from what he needs:

\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \]

Now, we need to find out how many days he needs to earn $250 if he earns $10 each day. We do this by dividing the amount he needs by how much he earns each day:

\[ 250 \div 10 = 25 \]

So, Mark needs to work for 25 days to have enough money to buy the bike. The answer is 25 days."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Nancy found 90 spiders in the woodshed. She also found 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. So, we calculate the number of millipedes:

\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

Next, she found a number of stink bugs that was twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we calculate the number of stink bugs:

\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together:

\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168. 

The correct answer is 168."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Erica is 30 years old.

1. Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth's age is:

   \]

2. Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is:
   \[
   35 + 7 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, we need to find out how much older Alice is than Erica. We do this by subtracting Erica's age from Alice's age:
\[
42 - 30 = 12 \text{ years}
\]

So, the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages is 12 years. The correct answer is:

John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, we first find out how many ounces of milk he drinks in total:
\[ 8 \text{ ounces/glass} \times 2 \text{ glasses} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we know that each ounce of milk has 3 calories. So, to find out the total number of calories John drinks, we multiply the total number of ounces by the calories per ounce:
\[ 16 \text{ ounces} \times 3 \text{ calories/ounce} = 48 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories John consumed is 48 calories. 

The final answer is:

"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many days the builder works in a month. He works 6 days a week and there are 4 weeks in a month, so:

\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days he works in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

Now, we know he gets paid $50 every day. So, to find out his total earnings for the year, we multiply the number of days he works in a year by his daily pay:

\[ 288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the builder earns $14400 in a year. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies.

The normal recipe calls for:
- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

For a quadruple batch, we multiply these amounts by 4:
- Flour: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)
- Milk: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

Now, we need to figure out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags:
- Total flour needed: 12 cups
- Number of 2-cup bags required: \(12 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups/bag} = 6 \text{ bags}\)

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles:
- Total milk needed: 4 cups
- Number of 2-cup bottles required: \(4 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups/bottle} = 2 \text{ bottles}\)

Now, we find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:
- Difference: \(6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \text{ bags}\)

So, Mark needs to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The answer is 4.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Mel uses an air conditioner that uses 900 watts of energy for 8 hours a day. So, we can calculate how much energy it uses in one day:

\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Now, if Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he will use it for 3 hours a day instead. So, the energy used in one day will be:

\[ 900 \, \text{watts} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

To find out how much energy he saves in one day, we subtract the new usage from the original usage:

\[ 7200 \, \text{watt-hours} - 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} = 4500 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Now, we need to find out how much energy he saves in 30 days. We multiply the daily savings by 30:

\[ 4500 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135000 \, \text{watt-hours} \]

Since 1 kilowatt-hour is equal to 1000 watt-hours, we convert the total savings to kilowatt-hours:

\[ 135000 \, \text{watt-hours} \div 1000 = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours} \]

So, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is:

\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total number of stripes on all the zebras. We have:
- Two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's \(2 \times 17 = 34\) stripes.
- One zebra with 36 stripes.
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, so that's \(36 / 2 = 18\) stripes.

Now, let's add these up to get the total number of stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

Next, we need to find the average number of stripes. We do this by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras. There are 3 zebras in total, so we divide 88 by 3:
\[88 \div 3 = 29.33\]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is 29.33.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{29.33}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tyson wants to make muffaletta sandwiches for a big game. Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and it serves 4 people. There are 20 people going to watch the game, so Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches to serve all of them.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Next, we need to find out how much meat and cheese Tyson needs. Since each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, for 5 sandwiches, he needs:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

Now, let's look at the cost of the meat and cheese:
- Meat costs $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
- Cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tyson would spend \(\boxed{50}\) dollars on the meat and cheese."
"Okay, let's go through the problem step by step again, but in a simpler way.

1. Allan starts with 40 cannolis.
2. He buys 60 more cannolis, so he now has:
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]
3. Initially, he has twice as many corns as cannolis. Since he has 40 cannolis, he has:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]
4. Then, he buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he has now. Since he has 100 cannolis now, he buys:
   \[
   100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]
5. Now, he has 100 cannolis and 60 corns. The total number of corns and cannolis is:
   \[
   100 + 60 = 160
   \]

So, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is 160. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{160}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He already walked half of his steps on his way to and from school, which means he walked 5,000 steps. Then he went for a short walk with his friend and walked another 1,000 steps. So far, he has walked 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

After his short walk, he still has 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means he must have walked the difference between his goal and the steps he has already taken. So, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
\[ 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps} \]

Therefore, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2000}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Toby's book is 45 pages long, and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find out how long it takes him to read the whole book, we divide the total number of words by his reading speed:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to finish reading the book 50 minutes before he needs to leave the airport. Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early. The answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money the company paid in May and June.

### Step 1: Calculate the total hours worked in May
- Number of employees: 40
- Hours worked per employee per week: 40
- Weeks in May: 4 (since May has 31 days)

Total hours worked in May:
\[ 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount paid in May
- Hourly wage per employee: $15
- Total amount paid in May:
\[ 6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of employees whose contracts expired in June
- Number of employees whose contracts expired: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)

### Step 4: Calculate the total hours worked in June
- Number of employees remaining in June: \(40 - 10 = 30\)
- Hours worked per employee per week: 40
- Weeks in June: 4 (since June has 30 days)

Total hours worked in June:
\[ 30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount paid in June
- Hourly wage per employee: $15
- Total amount paid in June:
\[ 4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total amount paid in both months
- Total amount paid in May: $96000
- Total amount paid in June: $72000

Total amount paid in both months:
\[ 96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is \(\boxed{168000}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. She bought 2 pounds of taffy. The taffy is on sale where you pay $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound. So, the cost of the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. So, the cost of the seashells and magnets is:
\[ 1.50 + 4 \times 0.25 = 1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50 \]

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 2.50 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10, so the money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, Sally has $3 left. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Tim buys two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, so it costs $800. Adding these together, the total cost for the fireworks is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

So, the discount amount is $240. We subtract this discount from the total cost of the fireworks:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, Tim buys a finale firework that costs $150. To find the total amount he spent, we add the discounted cost of the fireworks to the cost of the finale firework:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is $1110. 

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies every night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Her recipe makes 1 dozen (12) cookies. To find out how many dozens she needs to make 60 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a dozen:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days.

The correct answer is 5 dozens."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Marcy makes 50,000 candles. We know that 95% of these candles are safe and won't explode. So, the number of safe candles is:
\[ 95\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.95 \times 50000 = 47500 \]

This means the remaining 5% of the candles are dangerous and might explode. So, the number of dangerous candles is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Out of these 2500 dangerous candles, 1% of them have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. So, the number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog is:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.01 \times 2500 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Misha is buying 4 blouses that are 30% off. The regular price of each blouse is $20.

First, we need to find out how much the discount is for one blouse. The discount is 30% of $20, which is:
\[ 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount amount for one blouse is $6. This means the sale price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, Misha is buying 4 blouses, so we need to find out the total cost for 4 blouses at the sale price of $14 each:
\[ 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Joanne gathers apples from three types of trees:
- From the tallest trees, she gathers 30 apples.
- From the shortest trees, she gathers half the amount from the tallest trees, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
- From the average trees, she gathers some apples, which we need to find out.

Her sister helps and gathers:
- From the tallest trees, she gathers twice as many as Joanne, so that's 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
- From the shortest trees, she gathers three times as many as Joanne, so that's 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
- From the average trees, she gathers 0 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister is 500. So, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Now, we solve for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"To solve this, let's think about it step by step.

We know there are 180 heads in total. Each camel has 1 head and each dromedary also has 1 head. So, if we add the number of heads from camels and dromedaries, we get 180. This gives us our first equation:
\[ c + d = 180 \]
where \( c \) is the number of camels and \( d \) is the number of dromedaries.

We also know that there are 304 humps in total. Each camel has 2 humps and each dromedary has 1 hump. So, if we add the humps from camels and dromedaries, we get 304. This gives us our second equation:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

Now, let's solve these equations. We can use the first equation to express \( c \) in terms of \( d \):
\[ c = 180 - d \]

Next, we substitute \( c = 180 - d \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(180 - d) + d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - 2d + d = 304 \]
\[ 360 - d = 304 \]
\[ -d = 304 - 360 \]
\[ -d = -56 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56. 

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how many kilometers Tom traveled in total.

First, we calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
- He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
- So, \(200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}\).

Next, we find out how far he traveled in the next 2 days. He traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days:
- 30% of 800 km is \(0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}\).

Then, he didn't travel at all on the next day.

For the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day:
- So, \(300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}\).

Now, we add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

So, the total distance is \(800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}\).

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is \(\boxed{3140}\) kilometers."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Since Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker, we can find out how big Zack's locker is by multiplying Peter's locker size by 4. So:

\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]

This means Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

Now, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, to find out how big Timothy's locker is, we need to double Zack's locker size:

\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

The final answer is:
\[ 40 \]"
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between where Stanley's comb is and where Oliver is standing.

Stanley's comb is at 10,000 feet.
Oliver is at 3,000 feet.

To find the difference, we subtract Oliver's elevation from Stanley's comb's elevation:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

So, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the comb.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{7000 feet} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Josue got money from two places. The first place gave him $4000. The second place gave him twice as much as the first place, so that's $4000 times 2, which is $8000.

Now, if we add the money he got from both places, we get:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Before he got this money, he already had $5000 in his store. So, we add that to the $12000 he got:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in his store. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and each boat took 5 cats. So, the total number of cats taken away is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

After the boats took the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. First, we find out how many cats ran away:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

So, the number of cats left on the rock after some ran away is:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ 12 \]

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how much Bill has to pay for 2 years of the streaming service, let's break it down month by month.

First, we look at the first 6 months:
- The cost is $8 per month.
- So, for 6 months, it's \(6 \times 8 = 48\) dollars.

Next, we look at the next 2 months (months 7 and 8):
- The cost is $12 per month.
- So, for 2 months, it's \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.

Then, we look at the next 10 months (months 9 to 18):
- The cost is $14 per month.
- So, for 10 months, it's \(10 \times 14 = 140\) dollars.

Now, we add up all these costs:
- First 6 months: $48
- Next 2 months: $24
- Next 10 months: $140

So, the total cost is \(48 + 24 + 140 = 212\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\boxed{212}\) dollars."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Cole bought two pairs of jeans: tattered jeans and jogger jeans. The tattered jeans cost $28. The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. So, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Cole saved a total of $6. He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's find out how much he saved from each pair of jeans.

First, let's find out how much he saved from the jogger jeans:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how much he saved from the tattered jeans:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

The savings from the tattered jeans is $4, and the tattered jeans cost $28. So, the original cost of the jogger jeans is $22. The difference in cost between the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to add up the total capacity of all the vehicles used.

First, let's look at the buses:
- There are 4 buses.
- Each bus can hold 60 employees.
- So, the total capacity for the buses is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees.

Next, let's look at the minibusses:
- There are 6 minibusses.
- Each minibus can hold 30 employees.
- So, the total capacity for the minibusses is \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees.

Then, let's look at the minivans:
- There are 10 minivans.
- Each minivan can hold 15 employees.
- So, the total capacity for the minivans is \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees.

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
- Buses: 240 employees
- Minibusses: 180 employees
- Minivans: 150 employees

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is \(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\).

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is \(\boxed{570}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more from the store. So, she has 6 bird feeders in total.

Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds per day. So, 3 store-bought feeders will attract \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds per day.

Each of the bird feeders Lillian made herself attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds per day. So, 3 of her bird feeders will attract \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds per day.

Adding these together, the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day is \(60 + 90 = 150\).

So, the number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is \(\boxed{150}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the soup and cake first.

Aleksandra ordered a bagel that cost $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find out how much the soup costs, we need to calculate 25% of $4 and add it to $4.

25% of $4 is:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

The cake costs half the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, to find out the total cost of the dinner, we add the cost of the bagel, the soup, and the cake:
\[ 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) for her dinner."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kenny wants to buy a ticket to the amusement park, and the ticket costs $100. He has $50 left after buying the ticket, so he must have had $150 in total from selling his cards.

He sells each card for $1.5. To find out how many cards he sold, we divide the total money he had by the price per card:
\[ \text{Number of cards sold} = \frac{150}{1.5} = 100 \]

So, Kenny started with 100 cards.

The number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down in a simpler way:

The caterer was supposed to prepare enough hot dogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hot dogs each. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests would have two hot dogs each. That means 18 x 2 = 36 hot dogs were prepared.

But 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog. Since only 36 hot dogs were prepared, 4 hot dogs were left over. This means 4 guests didn't get a second hot dog.

So, the number of guests who didn't get a second hot dog is 4.

The answer is: **4**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Indras has 6 letters in her name. To find out how many letters her sister's name has, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. Half of 6 is 3. Then, we add 4 more letters to that number because her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name. So, we do:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

This means her sister's name has 7 letters. Now, to find out the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name:

\[ 6 + 7 = 13 \]

So, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

First, we need to find the total cost of all the items before any discount. Charlotte bought:
- A set of pot and pans for $120.00
- A set of mixing bowls for $20.00
- 5 utensils at $5.00 each

So, the cost of the utensils is $5.00 × 5 = $25.00.

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The items are 20% off, so we find 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final amount Charlotte has to pay is $132.00.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{132.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Dora wants to buy three things:
- A skipping rope that costs $6
- A board game that costs $11
- A playground ball that costs $2

First, we add up the cost of these items:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]
So, the total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we look at how much money Dora has:
- She has $2 from her allowance.
- Her mother gave her $16.

Now, we add the money she has to the money her mother gave her:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]
So, Dora has $18 in total.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total cost of the items from the money she has:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

The final answer is: \boxed{1}"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

1. Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur killed three quarters of what Prince Thaddeus killed. So, we calculate three quarters of 100:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
   So, Prince Arthur killed 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter killed twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we calculate twice 75:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
   So, Prince Walter killed 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce killed one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. So, we calculate one-fifth of 150:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]
   So, Prince Bruce killed 30 dragons.

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To solve this, we start by figuring out how much gas is in each container. We have 15 gallons of gas divided into 5 containers, so each container has:

\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, which means she needs:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. The final answer is:

\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many candy bars George bought.

1. George spent $5 in total.
2. He had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money. So, 99% of $5 is:
   \[
   0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   This means he spent $4.95 on chips and candy bars.

3. Each bag of chips costs 40 cents, which is $0.40. George bought 3 bags of chips, so the cost of the chips is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. Now, we need to find out how much money George spent on candy bars. We subtract the cost of the chips from the total amount spent:
   \[
   4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Each candy bar costs 75 cents, which is $0.75. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the amount spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar:
   \[
   \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5
   \]

So, George bought 5 candy bars. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops. He kept 5 for himself, so he shared the rest with his four friends. To find out how many lollipops he shared, we subtract the 5 he kept from the 25 he had:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Now, Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend got, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each friend received 5 lollipops. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Rory made a big cake that weighs 20 ounces. She cut it into 8 pieces. Rory and her mom each have one piece. 

First, we need to find out how much one piece of cake is. To do this, we divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces:
\[ \text{Weight of one piece} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces} \]

Rory and her mom each have one piece, so together they have:
\[ 2.5 \text{ ounces} + 2.5 \text{ ounces} = 5 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, to find out how much the remaining cake weighs, we subtract the weight of the pieces they ate from the total weight of the cake:
\[ 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces} \]

So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces. The correct answer is 15 ounces."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. First, we need to find out how many oranges they have together:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Now, they are sharing these oranges with their 6 friends, so the total number of people sharing the oranges is:

\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \]

To find out how many oranges each person gets, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he doubles that amount, so he needs 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so for 4 pounds, it will cost:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00, so for 2 boxes, it will cost:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find out how much each serving costs, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

So, the cost per serving is \$2.00. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater. Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so she needs to be there 4 minutes - 5 minutes = 1 minute earlier than Wayne.

The problem also tells us that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. So, if Wayne's drive is 4 minutes, then Bernadette's drive is 4 times that, which is 4 minutes × 4 = 16 minutes.

To get to the theater 1 minute earlier than Wayne, Bernadette needs to leave 1 minute earlier than her 16-minute drive. So, she needs to leave 16 minutes - 1 minute = 15 minutes before Wayne.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 15 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The correct answer is: **15 minutes earlier**."
"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to know the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, 3 yards is equal to 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

We know the area is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, so we can find the width by dividing the area by the length:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Length}} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we know the width is 40 feet, we can find the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is 98 feet. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"

- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack has 20 beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Okay, let's go through the problem again step by step in a simpler way.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The house starts at 40 degrees.
2. **Temperature Increase from Oven**: Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour.
   - So, the temperature increases by 5 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 15 degrees.
   - New temperature after baking = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.
3. **Temperature Decrease from Window**: Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - Time the window is open = 30 minutes.
   - Number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes = 30 minutes / 10 minutes/interval = 3 intervals.
   - Total temperature decrease from the window = 3 intervals * 2 degrees/interval = 6 degrees.
   - Final temperature after the window is closed = 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

So, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
49"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for James' triathlon times.

First, we know Jon's total time for the triathlon is 170 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so he takes 10% less time for the swim. Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James' bike time is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Jon's total time is 170 minutes, and he won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how long James took for the run, we subtract the time he took for the swim and the bike from his total time:
\[ 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James took 59 minutes for the run. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is \(1.25 \times 60 = 75\) minutes.
2. Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is \(75 + 5 = 80\) minutes long.
3. Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is \(\frac{80}{4} = 20\) minutes long.

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long. The final answer is 20 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Michael's horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour. If the horse runs for 30 minutes, which is half an hour, we need to find out how far the horse runs in that time.

1. **Convert 30 minutes to hours:**
   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ miles per hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

Next, we need to find out how much hay the horse eats for running 16 miles.

3. **Calculate the amount of hay consumed:**
   \[
   \text{Hay consumed per mile} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails}
   \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to buy 8 bails of hay.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the hay:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per bail} = \$3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times \$3 \text{ per bail} = \$24
   \]

Finally, we need to find out how much change Michael has after buying the hay.

5. **Calculate the change:**
   \[
   \text{Money Michael has} = 6 \times \$5 = \$30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change} = \$30 - \$24 = \$6
   \]

So, the change Michael has after buying the hay is \$6. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs and 2 loose eggs. First, let's find out how many eggs she has in total. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs are:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs} \]

Adding the 2 loose eggs, she has:
\[ 48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs} \]

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. So, the number of glasses she can make is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Joey starts with 214 points. He scores 26 more points, so his new total is:
\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Marcy starts with 225 points and scores 10 more points, so her new total is:
\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more points Joey has than Marcy:
\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. First, we need to find out how much each sneaker cost. We do this by dividing the total cost by the number of sneakers:

\[
\text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, the salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each on Monday. So, we calculate the money made from these sneakers:

\[
\text{Money from Monday sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many sneakers were left after the Monday sale. The salesman started with 48 sneakers and sold 17, so:

\[
\text{Sneakers left} = 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
\]

The salesman sold the remaining 31 sneakers for $25 each. So, we calculate the money made from these sneakers:

\[
\text{Money from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the money made from both sales to find the total money the salesman made:

\[
\text{Total money made} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out the profit, we subtract the total cost of the sneakers from the total money made:

\[
\text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the salesman's profit is $539. 

The correct answer is: **539**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Beatrice bought crayons in two different types of packets. Six of these packets had 8 crayons each, and the other four packets had 16 crayons each.

First, we calculate how many crayons are in the six packets with 8 crayons each:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \text{ crayons} \]

Next, we calculate how many crayons are in the four packets with 16 crayons each:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ crayons} \]

Now, we add these two numbers together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 + 64 = 112 \text{ crayons} \]

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 crayons. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have two choices:
1. A super ticket for $20 that includes a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra.
2. A movie ticket for $12 and then you can buy a popcorn and a soda at regular prices.

We know that by buying the super ticket, you save $2. So, if you didn't save any money, the cost would be the same for both choices. Let's figure out the cost of the popcorn and soda separately.

The cost of the super ticket is $20, and it includes a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of the popcorn and soda together is $19 (because $20 - $1 = $19).

Now, if you buy the movie ticket for $12 and then add the cost of the popcorn and soda, you save $2. This means the cost of the popcorn and soda together is $12 + $2 = $14.

So, the regular price of the popcorn and soda together is $14. Since the soda costs $3, we can find the price of the popcorn by subtracting the soda's price from the total cost of the popcorn and soda.

\[ \text{Price of popcorn} = \text{Total cost of popcorn and soda} - \text{Price of soda} \]
\[ \text{Price of popcorn} = 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $11.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to fill one balloon. We know that 20 balloons cost $900 in total. So, we divide $900 by 20 to find the cost of one balloon:
\[ \text{Cost of one balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the price of filling each balloon went up by $20. So, the new cost to fill one balloon is:
\[ \text{New cost of one balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at the new price. We multiply the new cost of one balloon by 170:
\[ \text{Total cost for 170 balloons} = 65 \times 170 \]

To make this easier, we can break it down:
\[ 65 \times 170 = 65 \times (100 + 70) = (65 \times 100) + (65 \times 70) \]
\[ 65 \times 100 = 6500 \]
\[ 65 \times 70 = 65 \times (7 \times 10) = (65 \times 7) \times 10 = 455 \times 10 = 4550 \]
\[ 6500 + 4550 = 11050 \]

So, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:
\[ \boxed{11050} \]"
"To find the average speed, we need to know the total distance the car traveled and the total time it took.

First, let's calculate the distance for each part of the trip:

1. For the first part:
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) miles

2. For the second part:
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \( 30 \times 1 = 30 \) miles

Now, let's add these distances to find the total distance:
\[ 120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we add the times to find the total time:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph} \]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 of them for 2 rubies. So, she has 5 sapphires left.

Each sapphire is worth $800, so the 5 sapphires are worth:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

She trades 3 sapphires for 2 rubies. Each sapphire is worth $800, so 3 sapphires are worth:
\[ 3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

These 2400 dollars she got from trading are for 2 rubies. Each ruby is worth $1200, so 2 rubies are worth:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies:
\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is $6400. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{6400}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples every day. We want to know how many apples they eat together in 30 days.

First, let's find out how many apples one of them eats in 30 days. Since each of them eats 4 apples a day, in 30 days, one of them will eat:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Since both Marin and Nancy eat the same amount, we need to add the apples they both eat:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is 240. The answer is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much potting soil one raised bed needs. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the volume, we multiply these three numbers together:

\[ 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Bob has 10 raised beds, so we multiply the volume of one bed by 10:

\[ 32 \times 10 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume by the volume each bag can hold:

\[ \frac{320}{2} = 160 \text{ bags} \]

Each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost:

\[ 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

So, the total cost for the potting soil is $1920. 

The final answer is: **$1920**"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We have 15 red cards. The number of green cards is 60% more than the red cards. So, we first find out how many more green cards that is:

60% of 15 is calculated as:
\[ 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]

So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Now, the number of yellow cards is the same as the sum of red and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

To find the total number of cards, we add up all the cards:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards is 78. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. Katelyn saw 50 fairies.
2. After 20 minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw. Since Katelyn saw 50 fairies, half of that is 25. So, 25 new fairies joined the 50 fairies that were already there.
3. Now, we add the 25 new fairies to the 50 fairies that were there: 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.
4. Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, we subtract 30 from the 75 fairies: 75 - 30 = 45 fairies.

So, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is 45."
"To find out what percentage of all the puppies have spots, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
   \[
   8 + 12 = 20
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many puppies have spots in total. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies, and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies. So, the total number of spotted puppies is:
   \[
   3 + 4 = 7
   \]

3. Now, to find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Plugging in the numbers we have:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. To calculate this, we can do:
   \[
   \frac{7}{20} = 0.35
   \]
   And then:
   \[
   0.35 \times 100 = 35
   \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{35}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how many trips the farmer needs to make.

First, we calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - He buys 2 boxes, and each box is 1 pound.
   - Total weight = 2 boxes × 1 pound/box = 2 pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - He buys 4 bags, and each bag is 12 pounds.
   - Total weight = 4 bags × 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - He buys 42 bales, and each bale is 75 pounds.
   - Total weight = 42 bales × 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - He buys 20 sacks, and each sack is 65 pounds.
   - Total weight = 20 sacks × 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds.

Now, we add up all the weights to find the total weight of the feed:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} + 48 \text{ pounds} + 3150 \text{ pounds} + 1300 \text{ pounds} = 4500 \text{ pounds} \]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[ \frac{4500 \text{ pounds}}{2250 \text{ pounds/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips} \]

So, the farmer needs to make \(\boxed{2}\) trips to transport all the feed."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

Grayson gets money by recycling cans and bottles. Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents, and each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents. She drinks 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles each week.

First, let's find out how much she earns from the aluminum cans each week:
- She drinks 3 cans, and each can is worth 2 cents.
- So, \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cents from aluminum cans each week.

Next, let's find out how much she earns from the plastic bottles each week:
- She drinks 5 bottles, and each bottle is worth 3 cents.
- So, \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cents from plastic bottles each week.

Now, let's add the earnings from both aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find her total weekly earnings:
- \(6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}\) each week.

To find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\).

So, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Becky and Kelly.

First, we calculate how much Becky paid for her apples:
- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- So, \(20 \times 0.45 = 9\) dollars.
- Becky got a $1 discount, so she paid \(9 - 1 = 8\) dollars.

Now, let's do the same for Kelly:
- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- So, \(20 \times 0.50 = 10\) dollars.
- Kelly got a 10% discount, which is \(10 \times 0.10 = 1\) dollar.
- So, Kelly paid \(10 - 1 = 9\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
- Kelly paid 9 dollars, and Becky paid 8 dollars.
- So, Kelly paid \(9 - 8 = 1\) dollar more than Becky.

"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Bob needs to do laundry for 80 rooms. Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- Twice as many pillow cases as sheets, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases
- Twice as many towels as pillow cases, so \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels

Now, let's add up all the laundry items per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

So, the total number of pieces of laundry per room is \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\).

Since there are 80 rooms, we need to multiply the total number of pieces of laundry per room by the number of rooms:
\[ 15 \times 80 = 1200 \]

So, the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms is 1200.

The final answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ shoes} \]

On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, so:
\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ shoes} \]

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, so:
\[ 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ shoes} \]

Now, let's add up all the shoes he gets:
\[ 10 \text{ (Monday)} + 30 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 60 \text{ (Friday)} = 100 \text{ shoes} \]

Adding these to the 200 shoes he already had:
\[ 200 + 100 = 300 \text{ shoes} \]

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes:
\[ 300 - 180 = 120 \text{ shoes} \]

So, the number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is:

1. **Total pencils at the start:**
   - There are 30 students, and each student has 10 pencils.
   - So, the total number of pencils is \(30 \times 10 = 300\) pencils.

2. **Pencils used after two months:**
   - After two months, 1/5 of the pencils were used.
   - So, the number of pencils used is \(300 \times \frac{1}{5} = 60\) pencils.

3. **Pencils remaining after two months:**
   - The number of pencils left after using 60 is \(300 - 60 = 240\) pencils.

4. **Pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - So, the number of pencils left is \(240 \times \frac{1}{3} = 80\) pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies. The problem says he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room. We can write this as an equation:

\[ \text{Cookies} = \frac{\text{Carrot Sticks}}{2} + 2 \]

We know the number of cookies Matt wants is 5. So we can substitute 5 for the number of cookies:

\[ 5 = \frac{\text{Carrot Sticks}}{2} + 2 \]

To find out how many carrot sticks Matt needs to eat, we first need to get rid of the 2 on the right side. We do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 5 - 2 = \frac{\text{Carrot Sticks}}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3 = \frac{\text{Carrot Sticks}}{2} \]

To find the number of carrot sticks, we need to multiply both sides by 2:

\[ 3 \times 2 = \text{Carrot Sticks} \]

So:

\[ 6 = \text{Carrot Sticks} \]

Therefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to know how long the shark is in inches. The shark is 10 feet long, and since 1 foot is 12 inches, we multiply 10 by 12:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know there are 2 remoras, and each remora is 6 inches long. So, the total length of the 2 remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we want to find out what percentage 12 inches (the total length of the remoras) is of the shark's total length (120 inches). To do this, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. The answer is:
\[ 10\% \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students don't have a desktop computer.

The problem tells us that 20 students don't have desktop computers. If 20 students represent one-fourth of the total number of students, we can find the total number of students by doing the following:

If 20 students are one-fourth, then the total number of students is:
\[ 20 \times 4 = 80 \]

So, the total number of students at the grade level is 80.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To figure out how many minutes Jason needs to walk each day, we start by knowing he needs to walk a total of 240 minutes to break in his new shoes. He plans to walk for 4 days in a week.

First, we need to find out how many days he will walk in 3 weeks. Since 3 weeks is 21 days (3 weeks * 7 days/week = 21 days), we need to divide the total minutes by the total number of days he will walk.

So, we do the division:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{21 \text{ days}} \approx 11.43 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Rounding to two decimal places, Jason needs to walk about 11.43 minutes each day.

The closest option to 11.43 minutes is 11.43 minutes.

So, the answer is: **11.43 minutes/day**"
"Sarah spent $300 on books, and each book costs $15. To find out how many books she bought, we divide the total amount by the cost of one book:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{300}{15} = 20 \]

Sarah gave an equal number of books to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child got, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[ \text{Number of books per child} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, each child got 5 books. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. We need to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

First, we add the number of kids allergic to dairy and the number of kids allergic to peanuts:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \]

But we counted the kids who are allergic to both (3 kids) twice, so we need to subtract those from our total:
\[ 15 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, we subtract the 12 from 32 to find out how many kids are not allergic to anything:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

So, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is 20. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out the total number of people going on the tour, we need to add the number of employees and the number of tour guides.

First, let's calculate the total number of employees:
- There are 3 groups of employees.
- Each group has 200 employees.

So, the total number of employees is:
\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- There are 3 groups of tour guides.
- Each group has 7 tour guides.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 + 21 = 621 \]

So, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{621} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the trip cost.

First, we need to find out how much the plane tickets cost. Tom and his wife each need a plane ticket, and each ticket costs $5000. So, for two tickets, it would be:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find out how much the hotel costs. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500, but because it's a busy weekend, the price is 20% more. To find 20% of $1500, we do:
\[ 0.20 \times 1500 = 300 \]
So, the busy weekend price is:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]
They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is $15400. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint. Jasper has half as many blue paint tubes as Ben, so Jasper has:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ tubes of blue paint} \]

Jasper also has three times as many yellow paint tubes as Ben, so Jasper has:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes of yellow paint} \]

Now, to find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has in total, we add the blue and yellow paint tubes together:

\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \]

So, Jasper has 11 tubes of paint in total. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. So, we need to find out how much the 2010 penny weighs.

To find the weight of the 2010 penny:
\[ \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains} \]

Let's calculate that:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains} \]

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Now, to find the combined weight of both pennies:
\[ \text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 1959 penny} + \text{Weight of 2010 penny} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} \]
\[ \text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains} \]

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains. The correct answer is:

\[

"Keegan and Tashay have already earned $83 from Keegan and $91 from Tashay. So together, they have earned $83 + $91 = $174. They need to earn $200 in total, so to find out how much more they need, we subtract what they've already earned from their goal:

\[ 200 - 174 = 26 \]

So, they need to earn $26 more to reach their goal. The answer is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on his player.

Each player can hold up to 100 songs. To find out how many more songs each can add, we subtract the number of songs they already have from 100.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]
So, Gabriel can add 80 more songs.

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]
So, Luri can add 40 more songs.

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel can add.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Stetson and Alec picked 60 oranges. Stetson ate 2/5 of these oranges. To find out how many oranges Stetson ate, we do the following calculation:

First, we find out what 1/5 of 60 oranges is:
\[ 60 \div 5 = 12 \]

Since Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges, we multiply 12 by 2:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges. For each orange he ate, he had to give up $10. To find out how much money he gave up, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by $10:
\[ 24 \times 10 = 240 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jillian's shoes cost $80. The problem says her handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. So, we first need to find out what 3 times the cost of her shoes is.

3 times $80 is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Now, we subtract $20 from $240 to find the cost of her handbag:
\[ 240 - 20 = 220 \]

So, Jillian's handbag costs $220.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"To find out how many hours James runs a week, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to know how many miles James runs in a week. He runs 12 miles a day and he runs 5 days a week, so:
   \[ 12 \, \text{miles/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 60 \, \text{miles/week} \]

2. Now, we know James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles by his speed:
   \[ \frac{60 \, \text{miles}}{10 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 6 \, \text{hours/week} \]

So, James runs for 6 hours a week. The correct answer is 6 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Uncle Ben has 4 horses, and each horse eats 5 pounds of oats twice a day. So, each horse eats:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Since there are 4 horses, the total amount of oats eaten by all horses in one day is:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds/horse/day} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how much oats they eat in 5 days:
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Each bag of oats has 50 pounds. To find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs, we divide the total pounds of oats by the pounds per bag:
\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

So, Uncle Ben needs \(\boxed{4}\) bags of oats to feed his horses for 5 days."

   - Northlandia: 21 degrees Fahrenheit
   - Midlandia: -3 degrees Fahrenheit

2. Add these temperatures together:
   \[
   -48 + 21 + (-3) = -48 + 21 - 3 = -29
   \]

3. Now, we need to divide the sum by the number of locations, which is 3, to find the average:

"To figure out how many days it will take the child to save the remaining money, we need to do a few simple steps:

1. First, we need to know how much more money the child needs. The toy car costs $12, and the child already has $4. So, we subtract the amount the child has from the cost of the toy car:
   \[
   12 - 4 = 8
   \]
   The child needs to save $8 more.

2. Now, we know the child saves $2 every day. To find out how many days it will take to save $8, we divide the amount needed by the amount saved each day:
   \[
   8 \div 2 = 4
   \]
   It will take the child 4 days to save the remaining $8.

So, the number of days it will take the child to save the remaining amount of money is 4 days. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much Heather spends on 2 packs of razors. Each pack costs $4.00, and she buys 2 packs, so:
\[ 2 \times 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the store has a ""buy one get one free"" offer. This means for every pack she buys, she gets another pack for free. So, for 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack:
\[ 1 \times 4.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Heather has a $2.00 coupon, so we subtract that from the $4.00 she would have paid:
\[ 4.00 - 2.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Heather gets 4 razors in 2 packs, and she only pays $2.00 for them. To find out how much each razor costs, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:
\[ \frac{2.00}{4} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per razor} \]

Since we need the answer in cents, and 1 dollar is 100 cents, we convert 0.50 dollars to cents:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents} \]

So, the cost per individual razor after all the discounts is 50 cents. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

1. **Bottom layer (4 girls):**
   Each of the 4 girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Second layer (3 girls):**
   Each of the 3 girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Third layer (2 girls):**
   Each of the 2 girls is 64 inches tall.
   \[
   2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Top layer (1 girl):**
   The top girl is 60 inches tall.
   \[
   1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we add up all these heights to get the total height of the pyramid:
\[
256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
\]

To convert inches to feet, we use the fact that 1 foot = 12 inches:
\[
\frac{636 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 53 \text{ feet}
\]

So, the height of the human pyramid is:
\[

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Charisma works for 8 hours every day. She gets up and walks for 5 minutes every hour she's at work. We need to find out how many minutes she walks in 5 days.

First, let's see how many times she walks in one day:
- She works for 8 hours a day.
- She walks every hour, so she walks 8 times a day.

Now, we know each walk is 5 minutes long. So, in one day, she walks:
- 8 times/day × 5 minutes/time = 40 minutes/day

Now, we need to find out how many minutes she walks in 5 days:
- 40 minutes/day × 5 days = 200 minutes

So, after 5 days, Charisma has walked for a total of 200 minutes. The answer is \(\boxed{200}\)."

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Paul drives his car twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon. He does this for 14 days. Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2.

First, let's find out how many times he drives in the morning and in the afternoon over 14 days.

- In the morning, he drives 2 times a day. So in 14 days, he drives \(2 \times 14 = 28\) times in the morning.
- In the afternoon, he also drives 2 times a day. So in 14 days, he drives \(2 \times 14 = 28\) times in the afternoon.

Now, let's calculate the cost for each part:

- The cost for the morning rides is \(28 \times 6 = 168\) dollars.
- The cost for the afternoon rides is \(28 \times 2 = 56\) dollars.

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the morning rides and the afternoon rides together:
\[168 + 56 = 224\]

So, Paul spent a total of 224 dollars on driving his car over these 14 days. The answer is 224 dollars."

"To figure out how many guests are needed for the two venues to cost the same, let's set up the costs for each venue.

For the first venue:
- There's a flat fee of $200.
- Each guest costs an extra $5 for food.
- So, the total cost is $200 plus $5 times the number of guests.

For the second venue:
- Each guest costs $25.
- Food is included in the price, so there's no extra cost for food.

We want the costs to be the same, so we set up the equation:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
1. Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20n \]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests needed for the costs to be the same is 10. 

The answer is: **10**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that together they collected 43 insects. Let's say David found \( D \) insects. According to the problem:
- Lily found 7 more insects than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects.
- David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects they collected is:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects. The answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Mariah’s grandma and Mariah used yarn together. Mariah used a quarter of a skein, and her grandma used half a skein. Each skein has 364 yards.

First, let's find out how many yards Mariah used:
- Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein, so she used \( \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \) yards.

Next, let's find out how many yards Mariah’s grandma used:
- Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein, so she used \( \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \) yards.

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:
- Total yards used = 91 yards (Mariah) + 182 yards (grandma) = 273 yards.

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards. The correct answer is 273 yards."

\[2 \times 5 = 10\]

Next, let's find out how many gifts the three friends who want 2 gifts each will get:
\[3 \times 2 = 6\]

Now, let's add the gifts for her friends together:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Cherrie also buys 10 more random gifts. So, we add these to the 16 gifts:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is 26. The correct answer is:
\[26\]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

We know the chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so:
\[ 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \]
So, the rug is 8 feet wide.

Now, the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. First, we find out twice the width of the rug:
\[ 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet} \]
Then we add 2 feet to that:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet} \]

So, the couch is 18 feet long. The answer is 18 feet."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. Two of those packs were strawberry gum, and the other two were different flavors. She paid $2 for each pack of grape gum and $1 for the small pack of green apple gum because it was half the price of the grape gum.

So, the total cost for the grape gum and the green apple gum is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \]

Since the total cost for all the gum was $7, we can find out how much the strawberry gum cost by subtracting the cost of the other gum from the total cost:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of the strawberry gum by 2 to find the cost of each pack:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final answer is:

"Frederick wants to make popsicle sticks and he has $24 to buy wood. He can get 200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood and 400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood. He has to decide which type of wood to buy to get the most sticks.

First, let's see how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy with $24. Each 2 x 4 costs $4.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

If he buys 6 pieces of 2 x 4, he can get:

\[
6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy with $24. Each 2 x 8 costs $6.

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

If he buys 4 pieces of 2 x 8, he can get:

\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Since 1600 sticks from 2 x 8 pieces is more than 1200 sticks from 2 x 4 pieces, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 pieces to get the most sticks.

So, the most popsicle sticks he can make is 1600.

The answer is: 1600"
"Mario has 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs. So, the total number of legs for all the dogs is:

\[ 6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Since each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, we need to find out how many pairs of snowshoes Mario needs. Since each dog has 2 legs, the total number of pairs of legs (and thus the total number of pairs of snowshoes) is:

\[ 24 \text{ legs} \div 2 \text{ legs per pair} = 12 \text{ pairs of legs} \]

Now, to find the total cost, we multiply the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair:

\[ 12 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $144.00. 

The correct answer is: **$144.00**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

Janet takes 2 bus trips each day, and she does this 5 days a week. So, the total number of bus trips she takes in a week is:
\[ 2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 10 \text{ trips/week} \]

Each bus trip costs her $2.20. So, the total cost for all her bus trips in a week is:
\[ 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$22.00 \]

Now, she has a weekly bus pass that costs $20. To find out how much she would save by buying the pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips:
\[ \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We know the farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep. The zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(20 \div 2 = 10\) sheep, which we already knew.

Now, let's add up all the animals:
- The farm has \(30 \text{ (cows)} + 10 \text{ (sheep)} = 40 \text{ animals}\).
- The zoo has \(60 \text{ (cows)} + 20 \text{ (sheep)} = 80 \text{ animals}\).

So, the total number of animals on the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes. The problem tells us that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. So, if we let the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought be \( S \), then Rose bought \( 4S \) onions and \( 4S \) potatoes.

Given that Rose bought 12 onions, we can say:
\[ 4S = 12 \]

To find \( S \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ S = \frac{12}{4} \]
\[ S = 3 \]

So, Sophia bought 3 onions and 3 potatoes. To find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we add these together:
\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is 6. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day to lose 30 pounds by his birthday, we can follow these steps:

1. Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.
2. To lose 1 pound, he needs to burn 3500 calories.
3. So, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn \(30 \times 3500 = 105000\) calories in total.
4. Now, we need to know how many days are left until his birthday. Today is December 31st, and his birthday is July 19th.
5. Counting the days:
   - December has 31 days, but we only count from December 31st to December 1, which is 1 day.
   - January has 31 days.
   - February has 28 days (2023 is not a leap year).
   - March has 31 days.
   - April has 30 days.
   - May has 31 days.
   - June has 30 days.
   - July has 19 days (up to July 19th).
6. Adding these up: \(1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 180\) days.
7. To find out how many calories he needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days: \(105000 \div 180 = 583.33\) calories per day.

So, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of 583.33 calories each day to reach his goal.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{583.33}

"Gerald earns $30 every day and works for 7 days in a week. So, his total earnings are:

\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left. 

The correct answer is **110**."
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. She is told to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 kilometers. So, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 milliliters of water for each kilometer she runs. So, for 2 kilometers, the total amount of water she needs to drink is:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 120 milliliters. The correct answer is:

120"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Julie started with $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes. To find out how much she spent on clothes, we calculate 20% of $500:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, we subtract that from her total:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Julie had $400 left after buying clothes. Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find out how much she spent on CDs, we calculate 25% of $400:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, we subtract that from the $400 she had left:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, Julie has $300 left. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house costs three times as much as the lot. Let's call the cost of the lot \( L \) and the cost of the house \( H \).

So, we have:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now, we can substitute \( H \) in the second equation with \( 3L \):
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house costs $90,000.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{90000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each. So, she bought:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack costs $4, so the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

She sold each bag for $8, so the total money she got from selling all the bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much profit she made, we subtract the total cost from the total money she got:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Tara earned is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Joe throws 25 punches every minute. A fight lasts 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, to find out how long the whole fight is, we multiply the number of rounds by the time each round lasts:

\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Joe throws 25 punches every minute, and the fight lasts 15 minutes. To find out how many punches Joe throws in total, we multiply the number of punches per minute by the total number of minutes:

\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

So, Joe throws 375 punches in total during the fight. The final answer is 375."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We know Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth of what Suzanne made, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
\]

Now, Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. So we calculate:

\[
\text{Kelsie's cookies} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

So, Kelsie made 18 cookies. The answer is \(\boxed{18}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Ali has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. First, we need to find out how much money Ali has in total.

- Four $10 bills: \(4 \times 10 = 40\)
- Six $20 bills: \(6 \times 20 = 120\)

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total money Ali has:
\[40 + 120 = 160\]

Next, Ali gives half of this money to his sister. So, we need to find half of 160:
\[160 \div 2 = 80\]

After giving 80 dollars to his sister, Ali has:
\[160 - 80 = 80\]

Now, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner. We need to find 3/5 of 80:
\[80 \times \frac{3}{5} = 80 \times 0.6 = 48\]

So, Ali spends 48 dollars on dinner. Now, we need to find out how much money Ali has left after buying dinner:
\[80 - 48 = 32\]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[\boxed{32}\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Rob takes:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. First, we find out what double the time Rob takes is:
\[ 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we add the 40 extra minutes:
\[ 240 + 40 = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house. The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how many skeins of wool Martha needs.

First, we need to figure out how many of each item she needs to make for her 3 grandchildren:
- Hats: Each grandchild needs 1 hat, so for 3 grandchildren, she needs 3 hats.
- Scarves: Each grandchild needs 1 scarf, so for 3 grandchildren, she needs 3 scarves.
- Sweaters: Each grandchild needs 1 sweater, so for 3 grandchildren, she needs 3 sweaters.
- Mittens: Each grandchild needs 1 pair of mittens, so for 3 grandchildren, she needs 3 pairs of mittens.
- Socks: Each grandchild needs 1 pair of socks, so for 3 grandchildren, she needs 3 pairs of socks.

Now, let's see how many skeins of wool are needed for each item:
- Hats: Each hat needs 2 skeins, so for 3 hats, she needs \(3 \times 2 = 6\) skeins.
- Scarves: Each scarf needs 4 skeins, so for 3 scarves, she needs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) skeins.
- Sweaters: Each sweater needs 12 skeins, so for 3 sweaters, she needs \(3 \times 12 = 36\) skeins.
- Mittens: Each pair of mittens needs 1 skein, so for 3 pairs, she needs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) skeins.
- Socks: Each pair of socks needs 2 skeins, so for 3 pairs, she needs \(3 \times 2 = 6\) skeins.

Now, let's add up all the skeins of wool needed:
- Hats: 6 skeins
- Scarves: 12 skeins
- Sweaters: 36 skeins
- Mittens: 3 skeins
- Socks: 6 skeins

Adding these together: \(6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63\)

So, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool. The final answer is 63."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Chris has 100 math problems to do. On Monday, he completes 12 problems. So, the number of problems left is:
\[ 100 - 12 = 88 \]

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times the number of problems he did on Monday. So, he completes:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]
problems on Tuesday. Now, the number of problems left is:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, he completes:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]
problems on Wednesday. Now, the number of problems left is:
\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]

So, the number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up all the quarts they can pick per hour:
- Tony: 6 quarts
- Bobby: 5 quarts
- Kathy: 10 quarts
- Ricky: 8 quarts

So, the total is \(6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29\) quarts.

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step like I'm explaining it to a middle school student.

1. The bakers baked 200 loaves of bread on Monday morning.
2. They sold 93 loaves in the morning. So, after the morning sales, they had \(200 - 93 = 107\) loaves left.
3. In the afternoon, they sold 39 more loaves. So, after the afternoon sales, they had \(107 - 39 = 68\) loaves left.
4. A grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. So, they added these 6 loaves back to their stock. Now they have \(68 + 6 = 74\) loaves.

So, the number of loaves of bread they had left is 74.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jackson has 36 red tulips and can plant 6 red tulips in a row. So, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row:

\[ 36 \div 6 = 6 \]

This means Jackson can plant 6 rows of red tulips.

Next, Jackson has 24 blue tulips and can plant 8 blue tulips in a row. So, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row:

\[ 24 \div 8 = 3 \]

This means Jackson can plant 3 rows of blue tulips.

Now, to find out how many rows of flowers he will plant in total, we add the rows of red tulips and the rows of blue tulips together:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \]

So, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers. The final answer is:

\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \text{ cups of raisins for each item} \]

Now, each batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make with 9 cups, we divide 9 by 3/4:

\[ 9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

So, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies. The answer is 12."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much Ada spends on electricity each week before and after she adds the new device.

### Before Adding the New Device:
- Ada uses 12 kilowatts per hour each day.
- The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the daily cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ kW/h} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$18 \]

For a week, the cost is:
\[ \$18 \times 7 = \$126 \]

### After Adding the New Device:
- The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour each day.
- So, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h} \]

The daily cost now is:
\[ 14 \text{ kW/h} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$21 \]

For a week, the cost is:
\[ \$21 \times 7 = \$147 \]

### Finding the Difference:
Now, we need to find out how much more Ada will spend in a week after adding the new device:
\[ \$147 - \$126 = \$21 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. So, in one day, one person can paint half of half a house, which is a quarter of a house. That means one person paints \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a house in one day.

2. Now, if we have 5 people working together, they can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4}\) of a house in one day. This means they can paint a whole house in \(\frac{4}{5}\) of a day.

3. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we need to convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) of a day into hours. So, \(\frac{4}{5} \times 24 = \frac{96}{5} = 19.2\) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 19.2 hours to paint a whole house. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{19.2}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know Ophelia has 20 sofas. The problem tells us that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if we let the number of chairs Ophelia has be \( C_O \), we can write:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
Since \( S_O = 20 \), we can substitute 20 for \( S_O \):
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
To find \( C_O \), we add 2 to both sides:
\[ C_O = 20 + 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]
So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

The problem also tells us that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, if we let the number of chairs Jenna has be \( C_J \), we can write:
\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O \]
Since \( C_O = 22 \), we can substitute 22 for \( C_O \):
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]
So, Jenna has 66 chairs.

The problem also tells us that Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if we let the number of sofas Jenna has be \( S_J \), we can write:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
Since \( C_J = 66 \), we can substitute 66 for \( C_J \):
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]
So, Jenna has 64 sofas.

Now, we can find the total number of sofas and chairs they both have:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs they have together is 172. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tom bought a CD for $4 and a headphone set. The total he paid was $48. First, we need to find out how much the headphone set cost. We do this by subtracting the cost of the CD from the total amount:

\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \]

So, the headphone set cost $44.

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could buy with the $44 he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we divide $44 by $4:

\[ 44 \div 4 = 11 \]

This means Tom could buy 11 CDs with the money he spent on the headphone set.

Now, if Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $48 to spend on CDs. To find out how many CDs he could buy with $48, we divide $48 by $4:

\[ 48 \div 4 = 12 \]

So, with $48, Tom could buy 12 CDs.

To find out how many more CDs he could have bought without the headphone set, we subtract the number of CDs he could buy with the headphone set from the number of CDs he could buy with the full $48:

\[ 12 - 11 = 1 \]

Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 1 more CD if he didn't buy the headphone set. The answer is:

\(\boxed{1}\)"
"To find out the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, let's break it down step by step.

Josh worked out for 4 hours every week except for a few weeks where he worked out more. We know that for 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week, and for 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours.

First, let's calculate the hours for the weeks he worked out 4 hours each week:
- He worked out 4 hours per week for 6 weeks.
- So, \(6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours}\).

Next, let's add the hours for the weeks he worked out more:
- For 2 weeks, he worked out 5 hours each week.
- So, \(2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours}\).

Then, for the week he worked out 6 hours:
- He worked out 6 hours for 1 week.
- So, \(1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

Now, let's add all these hours together:
- \(24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}\).

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Let's solve this step by step like we're in a middle school math class.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop, the number of people on the bus is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) people.

So, after the second stop, the number of people on the bus is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

Therefore, the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step as if I'm explaining it to a middle school student.

1. **Jame's Current Age:**
   - Jame will be 27 years old in 5 years.
   - So, to find out how old he is now, we subtract 5 from 27.
   - \(27 - 5 = 22\).
   - Jame is currently 22 years old.

2. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.
   - The problem says that in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - So, his cousin's age in 8 years will be \(60 - 5 = 55\).
   - This means his cousin is currently \(55 - 8 = 47\) years old.

3. **Age Difference:**
   - Now we know Jame is 22 years old and his cousin is 47 years old.
   - The difference in their ages is \(47 - 22 = 25\).

So, the number of years that separate their ages is 25.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total cost of the computer, two monitors, and a printer is $2,400. The computer costs $1,100, and the printer costs $400 less than the computer. So, the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we can write the equation for the total cost:
\[ \text{Cost of computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of printer} = 2400 \]
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"

1. There are 20 kids in total, and they are divided equally into boys and girls. So, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.
2. Each boy brought 60 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought by all the boys is:
   \[
   10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells}
   \]
3. Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells the boys brought plus four times that amount. So, each girl brought:
   \[
   60 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 60 \text{ seashells} = 60 \text{ seashells} + 240 \text{ seashells} = 300 \text{ seashells}
   \]
4. Since there are 10 girls, the total number of seashells brought by all the girls is:
   \[
   10 \text{ girls} \times 300 \text{ seashells/girl} = 3000 \text{ seashells}
   \]

So, each girl brought \(\boxed{300}\) seashells."
"Okay, let's think through this step by step:

1. George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. This means before eating, George had \(3 + 5 = 8\) candies.
2. Nick had twice as many candies as George initially. So, Nick had \(2 \times 8 = 16\) candies.

Therefore, the number of candies Nick has is 16.

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Chenny is 10 years old. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so we subtract 4 from Chenny's age to find Alyana's age:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \]
So, Alyana is 6 years old.

Now, Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we add 2 to Alyana's age to find Anne's age:
\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \]
So, Anne is 8 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find the total thickness of the four books.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so we calculate:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books together:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm}
\]

Adding these step by step:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm. 

The correct answer is \boxed{188}."
"Emma can make 72 vlogs in a month. So far, she has made:
- 18 vlogs in the first week,
- 21 vlogs in the second week,
- 15 vlogs in the third week.

To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we add the vlogs she has already made:
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs.

Now, we subtract the vlogs she has made from her monthly goal:
72 - 54 = 18 vlogs.

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach her goal. The correct answer is 18."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we have a dinner bill of $50. My wife wants me to add 20% as a tip. To find out how much the tip is, we calculate 20% of $50.

1. To find 20% of $50, we can do the following:
   - 20% is the same as 20/100 or 0.20.
   - So, we multiply $50 by 0.20:
     \[
     50 \times 0.20 = 10
     \]
   - The tip is $10.

2. Now, we add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount:
   - The bill is $50 and the tip is $10.
   - So, the total amount is:
     \[
     50 + 10 = 60
     \]

Therefore, the total amount I ended up paying is $60.

The correct answer is: **$60**"
"Let's break down the problem step by step as if I'm explaining it to a middle school student.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - There is $18 to be shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy gets an equal share:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   So, each boy gets $6.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy gets $6 initially.
   - He adds $5 more:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The next day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Spending $8:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Tripling the Remaining Amount:**
   - He then triples the remaining $13:
     \[
     13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:
\[
\boxed{39}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. He plans to save twice as much each day in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. April has 30 days, so the first half has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

If Elvis saves \( x \) dollars each day in the first half, then in the second half he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day.

The total savings in the first half of the month would be:
\[ 15 \times x = 15x \]

The total savings in the second half of the month would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

So, the total savings for the month would be:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that the total savings for the month is $1125, so:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. In the second half, he saves twice as much, which is:
\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Verna bought:
- 3 apples at $1.50 each, so 3 * $1.50 = $4.50
- 5 oranges at $0.80 each, so 5 * $0.80 = $4.00
- 6 peaches at $0.75 each, so 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Total cost = $4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she got, we subtract the total cost from $20:
- Change = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, Verna received $7.00 in change. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task he completes. If he finishes 20 tasks, we calculate his total earnings like this:

\[
0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task she completes. If she finishes 20 tasks, we calculate her total earnings like this:

\[
0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[
16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Jairus earns $6 more than Jenny. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jeff and Brad together have 100 dollars, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. Let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars. Then Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

So, the total money can be written as:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Now, to find out how much Jeff gets, we multiply Brad's amount by 4:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Jeff walks to work and back home each day. If his work is 3 miles away, he walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back, so that's 6 miles each day. If he has to work 5 times a week, we multiply the miles he walks each day by the number of days he works in a week. So, \(6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ miles/week}\).

The final answer is 30 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Elise writes the alphabet twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice. So, that's \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

Now, she has already written 52 letters twice, which is 104 letters in total. She then writes all of these 104 letters again, so she writes another 104 letters.

To find the total, we add the letters she wrote the first time and the letters she wrote the second time:
\[52 + 104 = 156\]

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 156. The correct answer is \(\boxed{156}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. In the first round, Ali calls 3 families.
2. In the second round, each of the 3 families calls 3 more families. So, \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are called.
3. In the third round, each of the 9 families calls 3 more families. So, \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are called.
4. In the fourth round, each of the 27 families calls 3 more families. So, \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are called.

So, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is 81."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mark was sick for 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month. So, over 3 months, he lost:
\[ 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

If his final weight was 70 pounds, we need to add the weight he lost back to his final weight to find out how much he weighed at the start. So:
\[ 70 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds. The answer is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. James's play set has 80 toys.
2. A play set five times larger than James's would have \(5 \times 80 = 400\) toys.
3. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys.
4. So, if we let \(x\) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has, then \(x + 2 = 400\).
5. To find \(x\), we subtract 2 from 400: \(400 - 2 = 398\).

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. The answer is \(\boxed{398}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Daniel to buy the items he wants.

First, we need to find out how much each type of item costs:
- A notebook costs $1.50.
- A pen costs $0.25.
- A calculator costs $12.
- A geometry set costs $10.

Now, let's calculate how much Daniel will spend on each type of item:
- For notebooks: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- For pens: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- For the calculator: \(1 \times 12 = 12\)
- For the geometry set: \(1 \times 10 = 10\)

Next, we add up all these costs to find the total before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $20:
\[10\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.10 \times 20 = 2\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Daniel has to pay:
\[20 - 2 = 18\]

So, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars on all the items he wants to buy."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much change Carly gets back.

First, we calculate the cost of the hamburgers:
\[ 5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$4 \text{ per hamburger} = \$20 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the potato fries:
\[ 10 \text{ packs of potato fries} \times \$0.30 \text{ per pack} = \$3 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the fruit drinks:
\[ 5 \text{ cans of fruit drinks} \times \$2 \text{ per can} = \$10 \]

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total:
\[ \$20 + \$3 + \$10 = \$33 \]

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we subtract the total cost from fifty dollars to find the change:
\[ \$50 - \$33 = \$17 \]

So, the change Carly gets back is \$17. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"To find out how much money Antonella earned, we need to break down the commission into two parts based on the sales amount.

First, let's look at the sales of $1000. For every $1000 sold, Antonella gets a 30% commission. So, for $1000, she earns:
\[ 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]

Next, we need to calculate the commission for the amount over $1000. Antonella gets an additional 10% commission on any sales over $1000. The amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \]
So, for the $1500 over $1000, she earns:
\[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]

Now, we add the two amounts together to find the total commission:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

So, Antonella earned a total of $450. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{450}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Bill starts with 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he has:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

He has 70 guests coming, and he wants to give each guest 2 bottles of water. So, he needs:
\[ 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, to find out how many more bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:
\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. The problem says it takes 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. In cold water, it takes 16 minutes to swim a mile. So, twice 16 minutes is 32 minutes. Adding 2 more minutes gives us 34 minutes for a mile in warm water.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water.

- In cold water, it takes 16 minutes per mile, so for 3 miles, it's \(16 \times 3 = 48\) minutes.
- In warm water, it takes 34 minutes per mile, so for 3 miles, it's \(34 \times 3 = 102\) minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water. We subtract the time for cold water from the time for warm water:

\[102 - 48 = 54\]

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day. The answer is 54 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80. The answer is 2 weeks."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

You bought a foot-long fish sub for $40. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub. So, the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs:

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, to find the total cost for both subs, you add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have a bag with 21 buttons. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each, and the rest have 4 holes each.

First, let's find out how many buttons have 4 holes. We know there are 21 buttons in total, and 7 of them have 2 holes each. So, the number of buttons with 4 holes is:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with 2 holes:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]

Then, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with 4 holes:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Now, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is 70. The correct answer is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's, so we calculate it like this:

\[ \text{Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Now, Peter's locker is a quarter the size of Zack's, so we do this:

\[ \text{Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. If we let the daily recommended cups of coffee be \( R \), then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, he should reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

Now, we need to find out how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by. Since the problem doesn't give us the exact value of \( R \), we can't calculate the exact number of cups. But if we assume \( R = 8 \) (a common daily recommended amount), then:

\[ 5R - 4 = 5 \times 8 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The pet shop has 6 cages in total. Out of these, 3 cages have 10 hamsters each, and the other 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs each.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- 3 cages × 10 hamsters per cage = 30 hamsters

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- 3 cages × 5 guinea pigs per cage = 15 guinea pigs

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- 30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

So, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents. The correct answer is 45."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for easier understanding.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]
Susan weighs 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]
Bob weighs 260 pounds.

Now, to find the total weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we add their weights together:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of people, which is 3:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds. The correct answer is:
\[ 180 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

1. The great pyramids are at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.
2. The sun starts at the top of the pyramid, which is directly above the entrance.
3. The sun moves 5 degrees up from the pyramid every hour.
4. We need to find out how many degrees the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours.

First, we calculate how much the sun moves up in 10 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we add this to the initial angle from the ground:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

So, after 10 hours, the sun will be 82 degrees from the ground.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{82}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

James has two sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.

James needs one candle for each son, so he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles in total.

Each pack of candles contains 5 candles, so James needs 20 / 5 = 4 packs of candles.

Each pack costs $3, so James spends 4 packs * $3/pack = $12.

Therefore, the amount James spends on candles is $12.

The final answer is $12."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

In the first week, Judy reads for 15 minutes each night. She does this for 7 nights, so we calculate the total reading time in minutes:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

So, in 105 minutes, she reads:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy reads a total of 100 pages.

Now, we add the pages from both weeks:
\[ 140 \text{ pages (first week)} + 100 \text{ pages (second week)} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches to start with. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, which means he ate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, which means he ate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sandwiches they ate in total:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches} \]

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total number of sandwiches they ate from the original number of sandwiches:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

So, the number of sandwiches left is 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Shiloh is 44 years old now. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

We're told that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let the nephew's age in 7 years be \( x + 7 \), then we can write the equation:

\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:

\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]

\[ 30 = 3x \]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the nephew is currently 10 years old. 

The answer is: \(\boxed{10}\)"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Total for these three teeth: \( 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00 \) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth.
   - Amount per tooth for the last two teeth: \( \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \) dollars.
   - Total for the last two teeth: \( 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the amounts given by the tooth fairy:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, to find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 45 from Richie's goals:
\[ 80 - 45 = 35 \]
So, Anna scored 35 goals.

Next, we know Richie also scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, to find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from Richie's goals:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]
So, Mark scored 60 goals.

Now, to find out the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add up the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{175} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. To find out how much Mitchell made, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam said he made $63. To find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Peter has $70 and he wants to spend the same amount each day for 7 days. So, each day he spends $70 ÷ 7 = $10.

From Sunday to Wednesday, he buys wooden action figures. He spends $10 each day, and each wooden action figure costs $5. So, in 4 days, he spends $10 × 4 = $40 on wooden action figures. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he buys $40 ÷ $5 = 8 wooden action figures.

For Thursday to Sunday, he buys plastic action figures. He spends $10 each day, and each plastic action figure costs $2. So, in 4 days, he spends $10 × 4 = $40 on plastic action figures. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, he buys $40 ÷ $2 = 20 plastic action figures.

Now, if we add the wooden and plastic action figures together, he has 8 wooden + 20 plastic = 28 action figures in total.

So, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 28."
"Okay, let me break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, the cost to spay the kitten is $200.

Next, the kitten needs 3 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]
So, the vaccines cost $60.

Then, the kitten broke 4 vases, and each vase costs $12. So, the total cost for the broken vases is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \]
So, the broken vases cost $48.

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[ 200 + 60 + 48 = 308 \]

So, the total cost for the kitten so far is $308.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{308} \]"
"Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses every week. So, Ford lacks 65 - 40 = 25 roses each week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Ford lacks 25 * 4 = 100 roses every month.

The number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month is 100.

The options are:
A) 80
B) 90
C) 100
D) 110

So, the correct answer is C) 100."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account. She takes out $100 every month. We need to find out how much money is left after 2 years.

First, we need to know how many months are in 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, in 2 years there are:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Katina takes out $100 each month, so in 24 months, she will have taken out:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she took out from the initial amount:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To find out the net profit, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of Bread:**
   - They spend $3.00 on bread for 10 sandwiches.
   - So, the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00.

2. **Cost of Cheese and Condiments:**
   - They spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches.
   - So, the cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
   - Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

4. **Revenue:**
   - They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.
   - So, the total revenue = 10 sandwiches * $7.00/sandwich = $70.00

5. **Net Profit:**
   - Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kate has 3 boxes of crayons, and each box has 64 crayons. So, the total number of crayons is:
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Each crayon is broken into 8 pieces to make a muffin crayon. So, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 192 \times 8 = 1536 \text{ pieces} \]

Kate can make one muffin crayon with 8 pieces. So, the number of muffins she can make is:
\[ \frac{1536}{8} = 192 \text{ muffins} \]

If she sells each muffin for $1.50, the total money she can make is:
\[ 192 \times 1.50 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Kate can make is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Michael's carpet replacement.

First, we need to find out the area of Michael's bedroom. The bedroom is 18 feet by 12 feet, so:

\[ 18 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot and the padding costs $2 per square foot:

\[ 12 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 2592 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ 2 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 432 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ 2592 \text{ dollars} + 432 \text{ dollars} = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of removing the old carpet. The old carpet costs $4 per square foot:

\[ 4 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of installing the new carpet. The new carpet costs $34 per square foot:

\[ 34 \text{ dollars/square foot} \times 216 \text{ square feet} = 7344 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[ 3024 \text{ dollars} + 864 \text{ dollars} + 7344 \text{ dollars} = 11232 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

\[ \boxed{11232} \]"
"To find out how many birds Mack saw on average each day, we need to add up all the birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up all the birds:
- On days 1 and 2, he saw 50 birds.
- On day 3, he saw 0 birds.
- On days 4 and 5, he saw 120 birds.
- On day 6, he saw 20 birds.
- On day 7, he saw 90 birds.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days Mack counted the birds. He counted for 7 days.

To find the average number of birds seen per day, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
\[ \frac{280 \text{ birds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 40 \text{ birds per day} \]

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds each day. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Okay, let's go through the problem step by step again, but in a simpler way.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
   \[
   \text{Starting value} = 20
   \]

2. **First Operation**: Add half of the starting value to the starting value.
   \[
   \text{Half of the starting value} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{First operation result} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: Divide the result of the first operation by 5.
   \[
   \text{Second operation result} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

4. **Third Operation**: Multiply the result of the second operation by the starting value minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Starting value minus 12} = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final value} = 6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

So, the final value of the number train is 48.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The boy has 5 cards.
2. His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so his brother has \(5 - 3 = 2\) cards.
3. To find out how many cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has: \(5 + 2 = 7\).

So, the total number of cards they have together is 7. 

The final answer is 7."
"To solve this problem, we need to find out what temperature Maggie should set her oven to get an actual temperature of 520 degrees, given that the oven is off by 4% when set to 450 degrees.

First, let's find out how much the oven is off by in percentage. When the oven is set to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference is:
\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

This 18-degree difference is 4% of the set temperature (450 degrees):
\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is off by 4% for any temperature setting. Now, we need to find the temperature setting that will give us an actual temperature of 520 degrees. If the oven is off by 4%, the actual temperature will be 96% of the set temperature. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.96x = 520 \]

To find \( x \), we divide 520 by 0.96:
\[ x = \frac{520}{0.96} \]
\[ x = 541.67 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to approximately 541.67 degrees to get an actual temperature of 520 degrees.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{541.67} \]"
"To find out how many minutes Max will spend watching the two movies, we need to add the time for each movie together.

First, let's convert the time for the first movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is \(60 + 30 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's convert the time for the second movie into minutes:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes, so 2 hours and 5 minutes is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes.

Now, we add the minutes for both movies:
- The first movie is 90 minutes long.
- The second movie is 125 minutes long.
- Adding these together, \(90 + 125 = 215\) minutes.

So, Max will spend 215 minutes watching the two movies. The correct answer is 215 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Herb's house is worth $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. To find out how much Juan's house is worth, we need to calculate 30% of $76,000 and then subtract that from $76,000.

First, let's find 30% of $76,000:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Now, we subtract that from $76,000 to get the value of Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Now, to find the combined value of both houses, we add the value of Herb's house and Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is $129,200.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{129200}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Judy bought 12 cups and twice as many dishes, which means she bought 24 dishes. So, she brought a total of:
\[ 12 \text{ cups} + 24 \text{ dishes} = 36 \text{ items} \]

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than cups, so that's:
\[ 40 \text{ cups} + (40 \text{ cups} + 20 \text{ dishes}) = 40 \text{ cups} + 60 \text{ dishes} = 100 \text{ items} \]

Now, to find out the total number of items brought by both Judy and her friend, we add their totals:
\[ 36 \text{ items} + 100 \text{ items} = 136 \text{ items} \]

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is:
\[ \boxed{136} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that one box of contacts costs $100.00, but there's a 10% discount. So, the discount amount is:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

After the discount, the price of one box is:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Now, we need to find out how many contacts Pete gets with 2 boxes. Since one box has 90 contacts, 2 boxes will have:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

If Pete uses one pair of contacts per day, 180 contacts will last for:
\[ \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ days} \]

But we are asked about the cost per pair of contacts. Since 180 contacts cost $180.00, the cost per pair is:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for easier understanding.

First, we need to find out how many hours Jill worked. She worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. So, the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours on Saturday} \]
And John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours on Sunday} \]
So, the total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate how much money each of them earned. They both earn $10 per hour.

Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

Hannah burns calories while doing aerobics and running. We need to find out how many calories she burns in total and then how much water she needs to drink.

1. **Aerobics:**
   - She does aerobics for 2 hours.
   - She burns 500 calories in 1 hour.
   - So, in 2 hours, she burns \(2 \times 500 = 1000\) calories.

2. **Running:**
   - She runs for 1 hour.
   - She burns 600 calories in 1 hour.
   - So, in 1 hour, she burns 600 calories.

3. **Total calories burned:**
   - Total calories burned = calories from aerobics + calories from running
   - Total calories burned = 1000 calories + 600 calories = 1600 calories.

Now, we need to find out how much water she needs to drink. She needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.

4. **Water needed:**
   - Water needed = (Total calories burned / 200) × 100 ml
   - Water needed = (1600 calories / 200) × 100 ml = 8 × 100 ml = 800 ml.

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.

The correct answer is \boxed{800}."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500. The note says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

First, let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).

- The number of red jelly beans is 1% less than blue jelly beans, so it's \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than blue jelly beans, so it's \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now we know there are 1500 blue jelly beans.

Next, we find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Red jelly beans: \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Green jelly beans: \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jared starts with a typing speed of 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his speed increases to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his speed by 5 words per minute, his new speed will be 57 WPM.

Now, we need to find the average of his three speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

First, we add these three speeds together:
\[ 47 + 52 + 57 \]

Let's do the addition:
\[ 47 + 52 = 99 \]
\[ 99 + 57 = 156 \]

So, the total of the three speeds is 156 WPM.

Next, we divide this total by 3 to find the average:
\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{52}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for eating Cheerios and donuts.

For Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds each week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is:
  \[
  1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}
  \]

For donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds each week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is:
  \[
  1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, to find the difference in weight:
- Weight gain from donuts: 8.75 pounds
- Weight loss from Cheerios: 6.25 pounds

So, the difference is:
\[
8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

The difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 2.5 pounds. So, the answer is 2.5 pounds."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Alex invites 100 people. Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends. So, that's 100 times 2, which equals 200 friends invited by Alex's friends.

Then, Alex calls 10 of her friends. Out of these 10 friends, 8 say they will bring their spouses. So, that's 8 more people.

Now, let's add it all up:
- Alex herself: 1
- 100 people Alex invited: 100
- 200 friends invited by Alex's friends: 200
- 10 friends Alex called: 10
- 8 spouses bringing additional guests: 8

So, the total number of people attending is 1 + 100 + 200 + 10 + 8 = 319.

Therefore, Alex will need \(\boxed{319}\) seats."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. The first dog is an Affenpinscher and weighs 10 pounds.
2. The next dog is a Dachshund, and it weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher. So, the Dachshund weighs \(2 \times 10 = 20\) pounds.
3. The next dog is a Papillon, and it weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. So, the Papillon weighs \(20 \div 4 = 5\) pounds.
4. The last dog is a Mastiff, and it weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon. So, the Mastiff weighs \(44 \times 5 = 220\) pounds.

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs \(\boxed{220}\) pounds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the boots Marilyn wants to buy.

First, we look at Amazon:
- The boots cost $16.
- The shipping costs $4.
- So, the total cost on Amazon is $16 + $4 = $20.

Now, let's look at eBay:
- The boots cost $13.
- The shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so it's $4 x 2 = $8.
- So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:
- $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay. The answer is \boxed{1}."
"To figure out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we can count the height of the beanstalk each day.

- On the first day, the beanstalk is 4 feet tall.
- On the second day, it doubles to 4 * 2 = 8 feet.
- On the third day, it doubles again to 8 * 2 = 16 feet.
- On the fourth day, it doubles again to 16 * 2 = 32 feet.

So, on the fourth day, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is taller than Mark's window that is 20 feet off the ground.

Therefore, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on the fourth day. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

First, we know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. So, to find out how much protein is in 1 gram of mushrooms, we divide 3 grams of protein by 100 grams of mushrooms:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} \]

Now, John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. To find out how much protein he gets from 200 grams, we multiply 200 grams by the protein content per gram:

\[ 200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the protein John gets in one day by 7 to find out how much he gets in a week:

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \]

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day. The final answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. So, if we let Jerry's current age be \( J \), then 5 years ago he was \( J - 5 \) years old. According to the problem, his current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

To find \( J \), we need to get all the \( J \) terms on one side:

\[ J - 2J = -10 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ -J = -10 \]

So, if we multiply both sides by -1:

\[ J = 10 \]

This means Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old he will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years. 

The final answer is 13."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

George needs to pay for dental work. He needs 2 implants, and each implant costs $2000. So, the cost for the implants is:
\[ 2 \times 2000 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. So, the total cost for the dental work is:
\[ 4000 + 500 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

George has already put down a deposit of $600. So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars} \]

George makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{260} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle \( x \). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's \( 2x \), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's \( 3x \).

So, we can write the equation for the sum of the angles in the triangle:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. Now, we can find the other two angles:
- Twice the smallest angle is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) degrees.
- Three times the smallest angle is \( 3 \times 30 = 90 \) degrees.

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is \(\boxed{90}\) degrees."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Colby has different types of coins:
- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up all the cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs. The answer is 69."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have:
- 5 dogs, and each dog has 4 legs.
- 2 cats, and each cat has 4 legs.
- 10 birds, and each bird has 2 legs.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- For the dogs: \(5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 20 \text{ legs}\)
- For the cats: \(2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs per cat} = 8 \text{ legs}\)
- For the birds: \(10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs per bird} = 20 \text{ legs}\)

Now, let's add up all the legs:
\[20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases this by 50%. To find out how much that is, we calculate 50% of 8 pounds:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.50 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, he adds 4 pounds to the original 8 pounds:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, the weight is 12 pounds. But it turns out to be too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight he now uses is 10 pounds. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for each year:

**Year 1:**
- Steve starts with 5 games.
- He buys 1 game each month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
- Total games after Year 1: 5 (initial) + 12 (bought) = 17 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after Year 1 (including Christmas): 17 + 5 = 22 games.

**Year 2:**
- Steve starts with 22 games.
- He buys 2 games each month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games.
- Total games after Year 2: 22 (from Year 1) + 24 (bought) = 46 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after Year 2 (including Christmas): 46 + 5 = 51 games.

**Year 3:**
- Steve starts with 51 games.
- He buys 4 games each month for 12 months, so he buys 48 games.
- Total games after Year 3: 51 (from Year 2) + 48 (bought) = 99 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas.
- Total games after Year 3 (including Christmas): 99 + 5 = 104 games.

So, after 3 years, Steve has a total of **104 games**."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how fast the plane is traveling. If the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate its speed by dividing the distance by the time:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we want to know how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel the extra 2000 miles. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

So, Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in one hour.

Next, we need to find out how much Marissa makes in one hour. The problem says Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much as Ruiz in one hour. So we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, if they both work for 12 hours, we can find out how much Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

And how much Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total amount of chocolates they make together, we add the amounts Ruiz and Marissa make:

\[ 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1260 pounds. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{1260}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Howard spent $8 on Monday. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as he did on Monday, so:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, so:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he spent:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from his original amount:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Howard has $12 left. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Patrick sold lemonade for 4 hours at a price of $0.50 per cup. He sold 15 cups each hour. So, we calculate his earnings for those 4 hours:

\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30.00 \]

Then, for the next 2 hours, he sold 10 cups each hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. So, we calculate his earnings for those 2 hours:

\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12.00 \]

Now, we add the earnings from both periods:

\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

So, Patrick earned a total of $42.00 from selling lemonade for 6 hours. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{42}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that for every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. To find out how many rotations the tires make in a month, we can do the following calculation:

1. Calculate rotations per mile:
\[ \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

2. Now, for 400 miles:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

Next, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations the tires can undergo by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert 72 months into years:

\[ \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We know that 2 pumps give 120 washes. So, each pump gives:
   \[
   \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump}
   \]

2. The bottle costs $24.00, and this will give us 120 washes. So, the cost per wash is:
   \[
   \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
   \]

3. Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, 0.20 dollars is:
   \[
   0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents per wash}
   \]

4. Since each pump gives 60 washes, the cost of each pump is:
   \[
   60 \text{ washes per pump} \times 20 \text{ cents per wash} = 1200 \text{ cents}
   \]

So, the cost of each pump is 1200 cents. The answer is \(\boxed{1200}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Joe has $50 to spend. The shirt he wants is $25, but there's a 30% discount. So, we first find out how much the shirt costs after the discount.

The discount on the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]

So, the shirt costs:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

Next, the shorts cost $35, and there's also a 30% discount on them. The discount on the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]

So, the shorts cost:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, we add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe started with $50, and he spends $42.00 on the shirt and shorts. So, the money he has left is:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Joe will have left after the purchase is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step in a simpler way.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. We know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. So, we need to find out how much butter he needs for 4 dozen croissants a day and then for a whole week.

First, let's find out how much butter he needs for 4 dozen croissants in one day:
- 1 dozen croissants need 1/4 pound of butter.
- So, 4 dozen croissants will need \(4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1\) pound of butter.

Now, since he wants to make 4 dozen croissants every day for a week (7 days), we need to multiply the amount of butter he needs for one day by 7:
- 1 pound of butter per day for 7 days will be \(1 \times 7 = 7\) pounds of butter.

So, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make the croissants for a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost for each street.

For Monica's street:
- Length: 150 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

So, the cost for Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 29100 \, \text{dollars} \]

For Lewis' street:
- Length: 490 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

So, the cost for Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 94860 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs for Lewis' street:
\[ 94860 \, \text{dollars} - 29100 \, \text{dollars} = 65760 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, it costs \(\boxed{65760}\) dollars more to repave Lewis' street."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months. That's the easy part.

Now, the research takes 10 times longer than the first 5 months. So, it takes 10 * 5 = 50 months in total.

The first 5 months are already covered by the $100,000, so we need to pay for the next 45 months. Each month after those first 5 months costs 50% more than the initial $20,000. So, each month costs $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000.

For 45 months, the cost is $30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

Now, we add the initial $100,000 to the $1,350,000 for the extended months. So, the total cost is $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $1,450,000.

The correct answer is **$1,450,000**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate beef tips, and there were 8 beef tips, each 1 ounce. So, the second player ate 8 ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is 16 ounces, the third player ate 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ate vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, we add up the meat they ate:
- First player: 6 ounces
- Second player: 8 ounces
- Third player: 16 ounces

So, the total is:
\[6 + 8 + 16 = 30\]

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find out how many posts the group will have in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. March has 31 days.
2. Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.
3. There are 1000 members in the group.

First, we calculate the total number of posts one member makes in March:
\[ 3 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93 \text{ posts} \]

Next, we find out how many posts all 1000 members make in March:
\[ 93 \text{ posts/member} \times 1000 \text{ members} = 93000 \text{ posts} \]

So, the total number of posts in March is 93,000.

The correct answer is 93,000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many loads of laundry Gary does in a year. Since he does laundry twice a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the total number of loads as follows:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Next, we know that each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. So, the total amount of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to use 2080 gallons of water. We know that a gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost is:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year. The correct answer is:
\[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Scarlett bought an aquarium for $10.00.

She also bought 2 bags of rocks. Each bag costs $2.50, so for 2 bags, it's:
\[ 2 \times 2.50 = 5.00 \]

Next, she bought 3 pieces of coral. Each piece costs $2.00, so for 3 pieces, it's:
\[ 3 \times 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Then, she bought 20 fish. Each fish costs $0.50, so for 20 fish, it's:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \]

Lastly, she bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
\[ 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 10.00 + 2.00 = 33.00 \]

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."

- In the second week, it doubled in height. So, \(3 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches}\).
- In the third week, it grew another 4 inches. So, \(6 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 10 \text{ inches}\).

So, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall.

The final answer is: 10 inches."
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to do a few calculations.

Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day. So, in one day, he sells:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Bill gave Prince a bull that weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take to sell all the meat, we divide the total weight of the bull by the amount of meat Prince sells in one day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from the bull. The answer is:

1. First, we need to find out how many seats there are in total. There are 4 rows and each row has 18 seats.
   \[
   4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ seats}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many seats the administrators took. They took one-fourth of the seats.
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats}
   \]

3. Now, we subtract the seats taken by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats are left.
   \[
   72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats}
   \]

4. The parents took one-third of the remaining seats.
   \[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. First, we need to find out how many street lights are at one intersection. Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. So, we multiply 4 by 6:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ street lights per intersection}
   \]

2. Next, we need to find out how many street lights are at all the intersections. There are 4 intersections, so we multiply 24 by 4:
   \[
   24 \times 4 = 96 \text{ street lights total}
   \]

3. Now, we know that 20 of these street lights are not working. To find out how many are working, we subtract 20 from 96:
   \[
   96 - 20 = 76 \text{ working street lights}

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 76."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have two DVDs. The first one can be played 1000 times before it breaks, and it has already been played 356 times. So, we need to find out how many more times it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 356 = 644 \]
So, the first DVD can be played 644 more times.

Next, the second DVD can also be played 1000 times before it breaks, and it has already been played 135 times. So, we need to find out how many more times it can be played:
\[ 1000 - 135 = 865 \]
So, the second DVD can be played 865 more times.

Now, to find out the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the remaining plays of both DVDs:
\[ 644 + 865 = 1509 \]

So, the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509. The answer is 1509."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Ashley's internet speed is 20 kilobytes per second (kb/s). We need to find out how much data she gets in one hour.

First, we know that 1 megabyte (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobytes (kb). So, Ashley's speed in megabytes per second (Mb/s) is:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} \div 1000 = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

Next, we need to find out how much data she gets in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in one hour, so we multiply her speed in Mb/s by 3600:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s} = 72 \, \text{Mb} \]

So, Ashley's internet connection speed in megabytes per hour (Mb/h) is 72 Mb/h.

"To find out the total number of cars the tow truck pulled, we need to break it down into two parts: the first three days and the last four days.

First, let's calculate the number of cars pulled in the first three days. The tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for three days:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, for the last four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. So, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the last four days. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the last four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Now, we add the number of cars pulled in the first three days to the number of cars pulled in the last four days:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000. So, the total cost of the cars is:
\[ 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of that price to get the cars, so the company paid:
\[ 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

The profit James made is the total cost of the cars minus what the company paid:
\[ \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is:
\[ 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, James made:
\[ \$17,500 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tiffany saw that when a big wave over 30 feet comes, only 25% of the 100 riders can stay on the wave without falling. So, we need to find out how many of these 25% are men.

1. First, we calculate how many riders can stay on the wave:
   - 25% of 100 riders = \(100 \times 0.25 = 25\) riders.

2. Out of these 25 riders, 60% are women. So, the rest must be men.
   - 40% of these 25 riders are men because \(100\% - 60\% = 40\%\).

3. Now, we find out how many men can stay on the wave:
   - 40% of 25 riders = \(25 \times 0.40 = 10\) men.

So, the number of men who can stay on the wave is 10. The answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler numbers.

We know the price of a diamond jewel is $2000.

1. The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = \frac{4 \times 2000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel.
   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. Now, we add the prices of all three jewels to find the total price.
   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800.

The final answer is $4800."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought:
\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \text{ truck stamps} \]

He also bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought:
\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \text{ rose stamps} \]

Now, to find out how many stamps he bought in total, we add up all the stamps:
\[ 16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45 \text{ stamps} \]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is 45."
"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to think about how fast they are closing the gap between them.

Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. The difference in their speeds is:
\[ 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

This means Tom is getting closer to Bob at a rate of 15 miles every hour. Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom. To find out how long it will take Tom to close this 75-mile gap, we divide the distance by the rate at which Tom is closing the gap:
\[ \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 = 11
   \]
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Tommy's fish} = 11 + 3 = 14
   \]

So, Tommy caught 14 fish. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{14}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Manny signed up for 10 karate classes that cost a total of $60. His parents will not sign him up for more classes if each class costs more than $10.

First, we need to find out the maximum cost per class if his parents decide not to sign him up again. If the cost per class is more than $10, they won't sign him up. So, we need to see how many classes he can take at most so that each class costs $10 or less.

If each class costs $10, then for 10 classes, the total cost would be:
\[ 10 \text{ classes} \times \$10 \text{ per class} = \$100 \]

Since the total cost is only $60, each class doesn't have to cost $10. We need to find out how many classes he can take at most so that the cost per class is $10 or less.

Let's say he misses some classes. If he misses 6 classes, he will have:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ classes left} \]

The total cost of these 4 classes is still $60, so the cost per class would be:
\[ \frac{60}{4} = \$15 \]

Since $15 is more than $10, his parents will not sign him up for more classes. So, he can miss up to 6 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know that Jewel processes 50 customers a day. Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, so she processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers a day.

Now, let's find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

For Jewel:
- Jewel processes 50 customers a day.
- So in a week, Jewel processes \(50 \times 7 = 350\) customers.

For Julie:
- Julie processes 100 customers a day.
- So in a week, Julie processes \(100 \times 7 = 700\) customers.

Now, to find the total number of customers they process in a week, we add the number of customers Jewel processes to the number of customers Julie processes:
- Total customers = Jewel's customers + Julie's customers
- Total customers = 350 + 700 = 1050

So, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers. The correct answer is \(\boxed{1050}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so:

\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Reggie also ran 3 miles more than Lynn. So, if we let the number of miles Lynn ran be \( L \), then:

\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

To find out how many miles Lynn ran, we need to subtract 3 from 20:

\[ L = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that four apples cost $5.20. To find out how much one apple costs, we divide $5.20 by 4:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]
So, one apple costs $1.30.

Next, we know that three oranges cost $3.30. To find out how much one orange costs, we divide $3.30 by 3:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]
So, one orange costs $1.10.

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples and 5 oranges cost. We do this by multiplying the cost of one apple by 5 and the cost of one orange by 5, then adding the two amounts together.

For 5 apples:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

For 5 oranges:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges. The correct answer is \(\boxed{12.00}\)."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The hole is shaped like a rectangular box, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular box:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to dig one cubic foot of earth. So, to find out the total time it takes to dig 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to dig one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total time} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out the total cost of Bill's new truck.

First, we know the base price of the truck is $30,000.

Next, we add the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500.

Then, we need to find out how much the leather seats cost. The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500 \]

After that, we need to find out how much the running boards cost. The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Cost of running boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the upgraded exterior light package, which is $1,500.

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 \]

Let's do the addition:
\[ 30,000 + 7,500 = 37,500 \]
\[ 37,500 + 2,500 = 40,000 \]
\[ 40,000 + 2,000 = 42,000 \]
\[ 42,000 + 1,500 = 43,500 \]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{43500}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Tim's new salary and bonus.

First, we need to find out how much Tim's new salary is after the raise. His original salary is $20,000 a month. The raise is 5%, so we calculate the raise amount:
\[ 20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000 \]
So, his new salary after the raise is:
\[ 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \]

Next, Tim gets a bonus that is half of his new salary. So, the bonus is:
\[ \frac{21,000}{2} = 10,500 \]

Now, we add the new salary and the bonus to find out his total monthly income:
\[ 21,000 + 10,500 = 31,500 \]

To find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
\[ 31,500 \times 12 = 378,000 \]

So, Tim will make $378,000 in a year. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{378000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much everything cost.

First, we calculate the cost of the suits:
- James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750.
- So, the total cost for the suits is \(10 \times 750 = 7500\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
- So, each pair of dress pants costs \(750 \div 5 = 150\) dollars.
- James buys 10 pairs of dress pants, so the total cost for the dress pants is \(10 \times 150 = 1500\) dollars.

Then, we calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit, and he has 10 suits.
- So, he buys \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is \(30 \times 60 = 1800\) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Cost of suits: $7500
- Cost of dress pants: $1500
- Cost of dress shirts: $1800

So, the total cost is \(7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800\) dollars.

The total cost of everything is \(\boxed{10800}\) dollars."
"To find out the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we can break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the news website. It publishes an average of 20 articles every day. Since February has 28 days, we multiply 20 by 28:
\[ 20 \times 28 = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, the sister company publishes an average of 10 articles every day. Again, since February has 28 days, we multiply 10 by 28:
\[ 10 \times 28 = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, to find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we add the articles from the news website and the sister company:
\[ 560 + 280 = 840 \text{ articles} \]

So, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is 840. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{840} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is \(60 + 4 = 64\) years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is \(64 \div 2 = 32\) years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is \(32 - 3 = 29\) years old.

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{29}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. First, we need to find out how much flour is in one bag. The question tells us that one bag is divided into 8 portions, and each portion weighs 2 kilograms. So, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion:
   \[
   8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms}
   \]
   So, one bag has 16 kilograms of flour.

2. Now, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. Since one bag has 16 kilograms, we multiply that by 3:
   \[
   16 \text{ kilograms per bag} \times 3 \text{ bags} = 48 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

So, the total amount of flour in three bags is 48 kilograms. The correct answer is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how far Alisa biked. Alisa biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for Alisa:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} \]

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \times 4.5 \]

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find out how far Stanley biked. Stanley biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} \]

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \times 2.5 \]

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance both biked, we add the distances together:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} \]

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} \]

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles."
"To find out how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs 4 feet of soil in 1 hour.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- So, the time to dig through the soil is \( \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \).

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs half as fast through clay, so he digs 2 feet of clay in 1 hour.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- So, the time to dig through the clay is \( \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours} \).

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay:
- Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well. The correct answer is 10 hours."
"Howie wants to buy cupcakes for everyone in his class, including himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates. Each person will get 2 cupcakes, one vanilla and one chocolate.

First, let's find out how many people in total are getting cupcakes. Howie, his teacher, and 25 classmates make a total of:
\[ 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 \text{ people} \]

Since each person gets 2 cupcakes, we need to multiply the number of people by 2 to find the total number of cupcakes:
\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \text{ cupcakes} \]

So, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Fishio's photo got 2000 likes after one week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, we first find out how many likes there were after three weeks:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means after three weeks, Fishio's photo had 140,000 likes. Then, she got 20,000 more likes recently. So, we add these 20,000 likes to the 140,000 likes she already had:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the total number of likes Fishio's photo has now is 160,000.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{160000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for clarity.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. So, the total cost was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]
But she got a $2 discount, so the final cost was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

The next day, the price of each pomegranate went up to $30. So, for 20 pomegranates, the total cost would be:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]
But the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost. So, the discount amount is:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
So, the final cost after the discount is:
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, to find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract the final cost on Tuesday from the final cost on Wednesday:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Ariadne sold red hats for $400 in the first month. The problem tells us that the sales from green hats were twice that amount, so she sold green hats for $800 in the first month.

Now, to find out how much she made in total in the first month, we add the sales from red and green hats:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]
So, she made $1200 in the first month.

Next, we need to find out how much she made in the second month. The problem says that her sales in the second month were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what she made in the first month. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]
So, she made $900 in the second month.

To find out how much she made in total over the two months, we add the amounts from both months:
\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Therefore, the total amount she made in two months is $2100. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours in total. But he gets 1 hour for free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost for the first hour is $15. The second hour costs twice as much as the first hour, so it's $15 * 2 = $30. The third hour costs twice as much as the second hour, so it's $30 * 2 = $60.

Now, we add up the cost of the three paid hours:
$15 (first hour) + $30 (second hour) + $60 (third hour) = $105.

So, James paid $105 for the carriage. The final answer is $105."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Sally's bank account started with $200 and now it has $420. This means she earned an extra $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Her weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was taken away, we subtract her weekly wage from the extra money she earned:

$220 - $300 = -$80

Since we got a negative number, it means $80 was taken away from her wage. So, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80.

The correct answer is: **$80**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. If each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, and she's inviting 16 guests, we can calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are needed for 48 deviled egg halves:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many dozens of eggs she needs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of whole eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen eggs} \]

So, Lori will need 2 dozen eggs. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages}
\]

So, Shiela has written 5 pages. To find out how many pages she still needs to write, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages:

\[
15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages}
\]

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"Mike's teacher gave him a homework to read a 200-page book. He plans to read 10 pages every day. We need to find out how many days it will take him to finish reading the book.

First, we calculate how many days it will take him to read 200 pages if he reads 10 pages each day:
\[
\text{Total pages} = 200
\]
\[
\text{Pages per day} = 10
\]
\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

Now, we know the deadline is in 30 days. To find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish, we subtract the number of days it takes him to finish the book from the deadline:
\[
\text{Deadline} = 30 \text{ days}
\]
\[
\text{Days required} = 20 \text{ days}
\]
\[
\text{Days before deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much James spent on his plane for the first year.

1. **Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 each month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   He spends twice as much on fuel as he does on renting the hanger. So, the fuel cost is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total cost for renting the hanger and fuel each month is:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Expenses:**
   To find out how much he spends in a year, we multiply the monthly expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   15000 \times 12 = 180000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   The total cost for the first year is the cost of the plane plus the annual expenses:
   \[
   150000 + 180000 = 330000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

So, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

Now, let's look at the multiple-choice options to find the correct answer:

A. $150,000
B. $330,000
C. $180,000
D. $300,000

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Now, we need to find out how long it took to cook pork and beans.

1. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, if rice took 30 minutes, pork took:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we find the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, beans took half of 80 minutes:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we add up the time for all the food:
\[
30 \text{ (rice)} + 50 \text{ (pork)} + 40 \text{ (beans)} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"To find out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more it costs for the first mixture compared to the second mixture, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

So, the cost is 3 dollars more for the first mixture. The answer is 3 dollars."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that:
- Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
- Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
- The total number of heads is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

First, let's think about the heads. If there are 20 heads in total, and each animal has 1 head, that means there are 20 animals in total.

Now, let's think about the legs. If all 20 animals were sheep, they would have \(20 \times 4 = 80\) legs. But we only have 70 legs, so not all animals are sheep.

To find out how many sheep there are, we can subtract the number of legs geese would have from the total number of legs. If there are 20 animals in total and 70 legs, and we know that geese have 2 legs each, we can figure out how many geese there are.

If there are \(G\) geese, then there are \(20 - G\) sheep. The total number of legs can be written as:
\[4(20 - G) + 2G = 70\]

Simplifying this:
\[80 - 4G + 2G = 70\]
\[80 - 2G = 70\]
\[2G = 10\]
\[G = 5\]

So, there are 5 geese. Since there are 20 animals in total, the number of sheep is:
\[20 - 5 = 15\]

Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Roger usually buys coffee for $5 per pound. But since he couldn't find his favorite brand, he had to buy a more expensive one that costs 20% more. So, let's find out how much the more expensive coffee costs.

First, we calculate 20% of $5:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$5 = 0.20 \times \$5 = \$1 \]

So, the more expensive coffee costs:
\[ \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \text{ per pound} \]

Roger needs to buy coffee for a week, and he uses 1 pound of coffee each day. That means he needs:
\[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the coffee:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$42 \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost is:
\[ \$42 + \$2 = \$44 \]

So, the total cost of everything is $44. 

If we look at the options, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought:
- 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each, so that's 2 × $2.00 = $4.00
- A bucket of fried chicken for $8.00
- A bottle of soda for $1.00

Now, let's add up these costs:
$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (fried chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

Gus spent a total of $20.00. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount:
$20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total newspapers delivered in a day.

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600.

The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198.

The number of newspapers delivered to District C is 209.

So, we calculate the newspapers delivered to District B as follows:

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - (198 + 209) \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - 407 \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 193 \]

Therefore, the number of newspapers James delivers to District B is 193."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John goes to a cooking class that meets 4 times a week. Each class is 2 hours long. He goes to class for 6 weeks.

First, we need to find out how many hours of class time he has in total. He goes to 4 classes each week, and each class is 2 hours long. So, in one week, he has:
\[ 4 \text{ classes/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since he goes to class for 6 weeks, the total number of hours he spends in class is:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Now, John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours by 1.5:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes. The answer is 32."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 150 teachers on the basketball court. Out of these, 60% are history teachers. To find out how many history teachers there are, we calculate:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find out how many math teachers there are, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

So, there are 60 math teachers. Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out how many hours all the math teachers sleep in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Arelia has $120.

Kassidy has 3/4 of what Arelia has, so:
\[ \text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:
\[ \text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all their money:
\[ \text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \text{ dollars} \]

If they share this money equally, each person gets:
\[ \text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each person would have $120 if they share equally. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find out how long the entire game lasted, we need to add up the time for all the quarters.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, and there are 4 quarters in total. So, the time for the first three quarters is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

In the last quarter, the game was extended by 5 minutes because of a tie. So, the last quarter was:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for the first three quarters to the time for the last quarter:
\[ 36 + 17 = 53 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the entire game lasted 53 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{53} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have a company with 50 employees. Out of these, 20% are management. To find out how many employees are management, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees.

Out of these 10 management employees, only 30% oversee the entire company. To find out how many of these management employees oversee the company, we calculate:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 10 = \frac{30}{100} \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

So, 3 employees oversee the company.

The final answer is 3."

For one muffin:
- Flour: 5 tablespoons
- Sugar: 3 tablespoons
- Salt: 0.25 tablespoons

So, the total dry ingredients for one muffin is:
\[ 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 \text{ tablespoons} \]

Now, to find out how much she needs for 16 muffins, we multiply the total for one muffin by 16:
\[ 8.25 \times 16 = 132 \text{ tablespoons} \]

So, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.

The correct answer is \boxed{132}."
"To find out how much candy each person gets, we first need to add up all the candy they have together. 

Robert has 3 pounds of candy.
Cindy has 5 pounds of candy.
Aaron has 4 pounds of candy.

So, we add these amounts together:
\[ 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to share this total amount of candy equally among the three of them. To do this, we divide the total amount of candy by 3:
\[ \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy. 

The final answer is:

Adam bought 7 candies of type A, and each costs $0.5. So, the total cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \]

He also bought 10 candies of type B, and each costs $0.75. So, the total cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \]

Now, we add the costs of both types of candies to find the total cost:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change he got, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \]

So, Adam got $4 in change. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Christina recorded her moods over 30 days. We know:
- She had 12 good days.
- She had 8 bad days.
- The rest were neutral days.

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[ 30 \text{ days} - 12 \text{ good days} - 8 \text{ bad days} = 10 \text{ neutral days} \]

Next, we look at how the days were distributed:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The last 8 days were neutral.

Then, we add the next three days:
- Day 29 and Day 30 were neutral.
- Day 31 was good.

Now, let's count the good days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Next 3 days: 1 good day (Day 29) + 1 good day (Day 31) = 2 good days

So, the total number of good days is:
\[ 8 \text{ (first 8 days)} + 2 \text{ (next 3 days)} = 10 \text{ good days} \]

Christina had 12 good days in total. So, the number of good days left is:
\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Janey has 21 books. The problem says Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. So, if we let the number of books Sally has be \( S \), then Janey's books can be written as \( 2S + 3 \).

We know Janey has 21 books, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find out how many books Sally has, we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books. The answer is 9."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know the bamboo grows 30 inches every day. Currently, it's 20 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert 20 feet to inches:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we want to know how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches tall. To find this, we need to see how much more the bamboo needs to grow:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

Since the bamboo grows 30 inches every day, we can find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches by dividing:

\[ 360 \text{ inches} \div 30 \text{ inches/day} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches tall. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs. So, he has 1 toy per dog.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. So, he needs 8 more toys to have 1 toy for each dog.
3. After buying the toys, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. When he left, there were 4 dogs, so twice that is 8 more dogs. Now there are 4 (original) + 8 (new) = 12 dogs in total.
4. With 12 dogs, he needs 12 toys.
5. When he came back again, 3 dogs were gone. So, he now has 12 - 3 = 9 dogs.
6. With 9 dogs, he needs 9 toys.

Now, let's add up all the toys he needs:
- Initially, he needed 8 toys.
- After buying the toys, he needed 12 toys.
- When he came back again, he needed 9 toys.

So, the total number of toys he needs is \(8 + 12 + 9 = 29\).

The total number of toys James needs is \(\boxed{29}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. **Initial Investment:**
   The total amount they started with is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invested \(\frac{2}{5}\) of $1200.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]
   So, Dylan invested $480.

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. **Frances's Investment:**
   Frances invested \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining $720.
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{2 \times 720}{3} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480

So, Karen earns \(\boxed{120}\) dollars in two days."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. To find out how many hash browns we can get from 96 potatoes, we first figure out how many hash browns we get from 1 potato.

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then:
\[ \text{Hash browns from 1 potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, if we have 96 potatoes, we can calculate the total number of hash browns by multiplying the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns per potato:
\[ \text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, the number of hash browns we can make from 96 potatoes is 576."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The elevator can hold a maximum of 700 kg. Jack is one person and each of the 8 other adults weighs 80 kg. So, we need to find out the total weight of Jack and the 8 adults.

First, we calculate the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Now, we add Jack's weight to the total weight of the adults:
\[ 640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The elevator can only hold 700 kg, so we need to find out how much more than 700 kg they are:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, they will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. The problem tells us that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, if Katarina has 68 cookies, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Next, the problem says Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, if Max has 73 cookies, the Cookie Monster must have 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Now, the problem also says Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, if Max has 73 cookies, Summer must have 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find out how many cookies they all have in total, we add up the cookies each person has:
- Katarina has 68 cookies.
- Max has 73 cookies.
- The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.
- Summer has 96 cookies.

So, the total number of cookies is 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is 298."
"To find out the original length of the dress, let's break it down step by step.

1. Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length. This means she adds half of the original length to the dress.
2. She also adds 20 cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim.
3. The final length of the dress is 140 cm.

Let's denote the original length of the dress as \( x \) cm.

When Shania extends the dress by 50%, she adds \( 0.5x \) cm to the original length. So, the new length of the dress before adding the lace trim is:
\[ x + 0.5x = 1.5x \]

Then, she adds 20 cm to this new length:
\[ 1.5x + 20 \]

We know this final length is 140 cm, so we can set up the equation:
\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( x \). First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:
\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Chris can mow his lawn in 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) when he's using the turtle mode. In rabbit mode, he can mow the lawn in 40 minutes.

Chris decides to mow half of the lawn in turtle mode and the other half in rabbit mode. So, he mows half of the lawn in 60 minutes and the other half in 40 minutes.

To find out how long it takes him to mow the whole lawn, we need to add the time he takes for each half:
- Time for the first half (in turtle mode) = 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.
- Time for the second half (in rabbit mode) = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we add these times together:
- Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the whole lawn. The correct answer is 50 minutes."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes to get to school. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. So, the total time they have spent so far is 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes. They have 30 minutes in total, so the time they have left to get to school is 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes. 

Therefore, the answer is 11 minutes."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have one twin and one triplet, and we know that one twin is 7 years older than one triplet. We also know that the total age of the twin and the triplet is 44 years.

Let's say the age of the triplet is \( Tr \). Then the age of the twin would be \( Tr + 7 \).

The total age of the twin and the triplet is:
\[ Tr + (Tr + 7) = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 7 = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr = 37 \]
\[ Tr = 18.5 \]

So, the triplet is 18.5 years old. Now, we can find the age of the twin:
\[ T = Tr + 7 = 18.5 + 7 = 25.5 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 25.5 years old.

The final answer is:

John has 100 minutes to nap. 

The correct answer is 100 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40. First, we need to find out how much four candies cost. If five lollipops cost $2.00 (because 5 x $0.40 = $2.00), then the four candies cost $1.20 (because $3.20 - $2.00 = $1.20).

Now, to find out how much one candy costs, we divide $1.20 by 4:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]
So, one candy costs $0.30.

Next, we need to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies cost. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]
The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]
So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost is $7.00. The correct answer is:

Now, we need to find out how many coins they save in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

In 120 months, Rong saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

In 120 months, Neil saves:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

So, the total number of coins they save together in 10 years is:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the total cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill. Let's say the total bill is \( T \). Then the heartworm check costs \( 0.6T \).

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, let's move \( 0.6T \) to the left side:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then add them up.

First, let's find the cost of each fruit:
- One apple costs $0.5.
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so it costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so it costs \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The crate has 5 bananas, so the cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The crate has 12 apples, so the cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The crate has 7 oranges, so the cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

Finally, we add up the costs of all the fruits to get the total cost of the crate:
\[5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0\]

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32.0}\)."
"To find out how many square feet Brittany's comforter is, we need to count the number of each color of square and then add them up.

First, we know there are 14 red squares.

Next, we need to find out how many blue squares there are. The problem says there are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, we add 4 to the number of red squares:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]
So, there are 18 blue squares.

Now, we need to find out how many green squares there are. The problem says there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, we add 6 to the number of blue squares:
\[ 18 + 6 = 24 \]
So, there are 24 green squares.

Finally, we need to find out how many white squares there are. The problem says there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, we subtract 12 from the number of green squares:
\[ 24 - 12 = 12 \]
So, there are 12 white squares.

Now, we add up all the squares:
\[ 14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68 \text{ squares} \]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, each square has an area of 1 square foot. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is:
\[ 68 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending the function. So, the total number of people is:
\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

The restaurant has 8 high chairs. It also has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we add the regular chairs and the high chairs to find out how many chairs are there in total:
\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the total number of chairs from the total number of people:
\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We have 50 deer in a field. If 50 percent of them are bucks, we can find out how many bucks there are by calculating 50% of 50. 

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.50 \times 50 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 bucks. Now, we know that 20 percent of these bucks are 8 points. To find out how many bucks are 8 points, we calculate 20% of 25.

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

So, there are 5 bucks that have 8 points. 

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how many points the class is missing for the trip.

First, we know Adam has collected 50 points. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points Betty collected, we calculate:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \]
So, Betty collected:
\[ 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points} \]

Next, Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points, so:
\[ \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ points} \]

Now, let's add up all the points collected by Adam, Betty, Marta, and Tom:
\[ 50 + 65 + 90 + 30 = 235 \text{ points} \]

The class needs at least 400 points to go on the trip. To find out how many points they are missing, we subtract the points they have from the minimum required points:
\[ 400 - 235 = 165 \text{ points} \]

So, the class is missing \(\boxed{165}\) points to go on the trip."
"Great Grandma Jones has three children. Each of her children has three children of their own, which are Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren. And each of these grandchildren has three babies of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' great grand-babies.

To find out how many great grand-babies there are, we can follow these steps:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her 3 children has 3 grandchildren.
   - So, the total number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 great grand-babies.
   - So, the total number of great grand-babies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is 27.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Greta's paycheck.

Greta's total paycheck is $2400.00.

First, she puts 50% of her paycheck into her retirement account. To find out how much that is, we calculate:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 2400 = 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]
So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account.

Next, she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment. To find out how much that is, we calculate:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 2400 = 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]
So, she uses $480 for her car payment.

Now, to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the amounts she put into her retirement account and the amount she used for her car payment from her total paycheck:
\[ 2400 - 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, Greta has $720 left to spend. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{720} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know the box can hold 20 pencils, but 4 pencils are missing. So, we need to find out how many pencils are actually in the box now.

1. First, we subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity of the box:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16
   \]
   So, there are 16 pencils in the box now.

2. Next, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils there are. Since each pair has 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2:
   \[
   16 \div 2 = 8
   \]
   So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many fireworks there are in total. The city is setting off 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 20 fireworks. So, we multiply 15 by 20:
\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]
There are 300 fireworks in total.

Next, Hannah can see 40% of these fireworks from her house. To find out how many fireworks that is, we calculate 40% of 300:
\[ 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \]
So, Hannah can see 120 fireworks from her house.

Now, Hannah also sets off 3 boxes of fireworks in her backyard. Each box has 5 fireworks, so we multiply 3 by 5:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
Hannah sets off 15 fireworks in her backyard.

To find out the total number of fireworks Hannah sees, we add the fireworks she sees from the display to the fireworks she sets off in her backyard:
\[ 120 + 15 = 135 \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah sees is 135. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{135} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, and they meet up with 7 more friends. So, the total number of people is:
\[ 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person will need:
- 1 seat
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

So, the total number of drinks and snacks needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ people} \times (2 \text{ drinks} + 3 \text{ snacks}) = 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ items} \]

Each drink and each snack costs $2. So, the total cost for the drinks and snacks is:
\[ 100 \text{ items} \times 2 \text{ dollars per item} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the group has spent a total of $200 on drinks and snacks. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know the total capacity of all three trucks together is 11,600 pounds. If we add Gissela's and Gordy's truck capacities together, we get:

\[ 4000 + 4800 = 8800 \text{ pounds} \]

To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:

\[ 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2800} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

We know there are 8 males and 6 females. Each female ate 3 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

Now, we need to find out how many dumplings the males ate in total:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

To find the total number of dumplings cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the males:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

So, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means for every 5 parts, Gerald gets 3 parts and Julia gets 2 parts.

First, we need to find out how much each part is worth. We do this by dividing the total amount by the total parts:
\[ \text{Value of one part} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now, we calculate how much Gerald got:
\[ \text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so we subtract that from his share:
\[ \text{Money left with Gerald} = 60 - 10 = 50 \]

So, the amount of money Gerald had left is $50.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the cat can run 15 feet per second. The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, so we need to find out how fast the turtle is. To do this, we divide the cat's speed by 5:

\[ \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \]

Now, we want to know how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, we plug in the turtle's speed and the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"The firefighters have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. They need to raise a total of $6300, so they still need to raise:
\[ 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]
They raise $700 every hour. To find out how many more hours they need to raise $4200, we divide $4200 by $700:
\[ 4200 \div 700 = 6 \]
So, they need to raise money for 6 more hours. Adding the first 3 hours, the total number of hours they need to raise money is:
\[ 3 + 6 = 9 \]
Therefore, the total number of hours they have to fundraise in total is 9 hours. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. Out of the 40% that Colorado City uses, 80% is used for industrial purposes.
3. To find out what percentage of the river's total water is used for non-industrial purposes, we need to subtract the industrial use from the total use by Colorado City.

First, let's calculate how much water is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City:
- 80% of 40% is:
  \[
  0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 = 32\%
  \]
So, 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City.

Next, we subtract the industrial use from the total use to find the non-industrial use:
- Total use by Colorado City: 40%
- Industrial use: 32%
- Non-industrial use: 40% - 32% = 8%

Therefore, 8% of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

First, we find out how much ice cream the factory makes in one hour.

For chocolate ice cream:
- In 2 hours, they make 100 quarts.
- So in 1 hour, they make \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- In 4 hours, they make 50 quarts.
- So in 1 hour, they make \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we want to know how much ice cream they make in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Adding these together:
- \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

So, the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts. The answer is 3000."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Marcus' total bill is.

First, we calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

1. For the croissants, Marcus ordered 5 at $3.00 each:
\[ 5 \times 3.00 = 15.00 \]

2. For the cinnamon rolls, he ordered 4 at $2.50 each:
\[ 4 \times 2.50 = 10.00 \]

3. For the mini quiches, he ordered 3 at $4.00 each:
\[ 3 \times 4.00 = 12.00 \]

4. For the blueberry muffins, he ordered 13 at $1.00 each:
\[ 13 \times 1.00 = 13.00 \]

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total before the discount:
\[ 15.00 + 10.00 + 12.00 + 13.00 = 50.00 \]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his total purchase. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $50.00:
\[ 0.10 \times 50.00 = 5.00 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final bill:
\[ 50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00 \]

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."

"Sure, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. We need to find out how much candy each of them has left after 14 days and then find the difference.

First, let's see how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
- Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy each day.
- In 14 days, she eats \(4 \times 14 = 56\) pieces of candy.

So, after 14 days, Ginger has:
- \(100 - 56 = 44\) pieces of candy left.

Now, let's see how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
- Amy eats 3 pieces of candy each day.
- In 14 days, she eats \(3 \times 14 = 42\) pieces of candy.

So, after 14 days, Amy has:
- \(100 - 42 = 58\) pieces of candy left.

To find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger, we subtract the number of pieces Ginger has from the number of pieces Amy has:
- \(58 - 44 = 14\)

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after 14 days. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we first need to calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered. The bathroom is 36 square feet, and he needs to cover two-thirds of it. So, we calculate two-thirds of 36 square feet:

\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we know that for every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles needed is:

\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ square feet} \times 24 \text{ tiles/square foot} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden needs 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{576} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

James had to pay $20 to go pick the blueberries and then $1.5 for each pound he picked. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

So, the total cost for James is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Now, let's look at the cost if he bought the same amount of blueberries at the store. The store sells blueberries at $2.5 per pound, so:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost he paid from the cost at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \$10 \]

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The company wanted to buy 500 computers at $700 each. So, the total planned cost was:
\[ 500 \times 700 = 350,000 \]

But the price of each computer went up by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to $700:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]
\[ \text{New price} = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it would cost to buy 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:
\[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John makes an omelet with 6 eggs, 2 ounces of cheese, and 2 ounces of ham. We need to find out how many calories are in the omelet.

First, let's look at the calories from the eggs:
- Each egg has 75 calories.
- John uses 6 eggs.
- So, the eggs have \(6 \times 75 = 450\) calories.

Next, let's look at the calories from the cheese:
- The cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
- John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
- So, the cheese has \(2 \times 120 = 240\) calories.

Then, let's look at the calories from the ham:
- The ham has 40 calories per ounce.
- John uses 2 ounces of ham.
- So, the ham has \(2 \times 40 = 80\) calories.

Now, we add up all the calories:
- Eggs: 450 calories

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Helga dances with both hands at her sides and can tap her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. So, when she does this, she taps both feet 550 times per minute (300 + 250).

Now, when she raises her arms, she taps each foot 200 times per minute, so she taps both feet 400 times per minute (200 + 200).

She dances for a total of 5 minutes, but she raises her arms for 2 of those minutes. So, she dances with both hands at her sides for 3 minutes.

First, let's calculate the taps when she's dancing with both hands at her sides:
- For 3 minutes at 550 taps per minute: \(3 \times 550 = 1650\) taps.

Next, let's calculate the taps when she raises her arms:
- For 2 minutes at 400 taps per minute: \(2 \times 400 = 800\) taps.

Now, we add the taps from both parts:
- Total taps: \(1650 + 800 = 2450\) taps.

So, the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Ron.

If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, it will cost him $450 to fix the damage to his car. But if he decides to fix it himself, he has to pay a fine of $120 and buy 3 buckets of asphalt. Each bucket costs $25.

First, let's calculate the cost of the asphalt:
- 3 buckets at $25 each is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Now, let's add the fine and the cost of the asphalt:
- Fine: $120
- Cost of asphalt: $75
- Total cost: $120 + $75 = $195

If the pothole isn't fixed, the damage to his car will be $450. So, the money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself is:
- $450 - $195 = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself. The answer is \(\boxed{255}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The restaurant starts with 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs.
2. They sent 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs to the carpenter for repair.
3. To find out how many normal chairs are left, we subtract the repaired chairs from the total normal chairs:
   \[
   170 - 20 = 150
   \]
4. To find out how many baby chairs are left, we subtract the repaired chairs from the total baby chairs:
   \[
   23 - 13 = 10
   \]
5. Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to find the total number of chairs left:
   \[
   150 + 10 = 160
   \]

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left. The final answer is 160."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Each pizza has 12 slices, and there are 5 people (Bryce and his 4 friends), so they ordered 5 pizzas.
2. Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. So, 3 pizzas were eaten by 3 people.
   - 3 pizzas * 2/3 = 2 pizzas were eaten by Bryce and his friends.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices, so 2 pizzas * 12 slices = 24 slices were eaten.
3. The other two friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.
   - 2 pizzas * 3/4 = 1.5 pizzas were eaten by the other two friends.
   - Each pizza has 12 slices, so 1.5 pizzas * 12 slices = 18 slices were eaten.
4. Now, let's add up all the slices eaten:
   - 24 slices + 18 slices = 42 slices were eaten in total.
5. The total number of slices they ordered was 5 pizzas * 12 slices = 60 slices.
6. So, the number of slices left is 60 slices - 42 slices = 18 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is 18. The correct answer is:

**18**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same number of sausages but in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time it takes the cat. So, we first need to find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages.

\[
\text{Time for the dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages. We add the time it takes the cat and the dog, and then divide by 2.

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Topher's shoe is 100 inches long. The problem says that Topher's shoe length is 10 inches more than 9 times Bobby's shoe length. We need to find out how long Bobby's shoe is.

Let's say Bobby's shoe length is \( x \) inches. According to the problem, we can write the equation:
\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \). First, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:
\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, Bobby's shoe is 10 inches long.

The length of one of Bobby's shoes is \(\boxed{10}\) inches."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many windows there are in the students' cars. There are 64 cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, we multiply 64 by 4:
\[ 64 \times 4 = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we do the same for the teachers' cars. There are 32 cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, we multiply 32 by 2:
\[ 32 \times 2 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we need to find out how many windows Hannah smashes. She smashes a quarter of the students' windows and three-quarters of the teachers' windows.

For the students' windows:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

For the teachers' windows:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the windows smashed from both groups:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \text{ windows} \]

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is 112."
"To find out what percentage of the spools are blue, we need to follow these steps:

First, let's add up all the spools Candy has:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Now, let's add these numbers together to find the total number of spools:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools in total.

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. We add the blue spools together:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools.

Now, to find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and then multiply by 100:
(60 / 150) * 100 = 40%.

So, 40% of the spools are blue. The answer is 40%."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

At the start, there were 5000 people waiting to vote. By midday, 2/5 of them had voted. To find out how many people that is, we do:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

So, 2000 people voted by midday. That means:

\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

people were still waiting to vote by midday.

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people voted. So, we need to find out how many 2/3 of 3000 is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

So, 2000 more people voted by 16:00. That means:

\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

people did not vote by 16:00.

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000."
"To find out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew. Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so in 30 days, he will chew:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Each pack of gum has 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces in each pack:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many smores are needed in total. There are 9 kids and each kid wants 2 smores, so:
\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \]

There are also 6 adults, and each adult wants 1 smore, so:
\[ 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of smores needed:
\[ 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 smores. So, to find out how many sleeves are needed, we divide the total number of smores by the number of smores each sleeve makes:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, we need:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

So, they will need 1 box of graham crackers. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Dora is 15 years old. The problem tells us that Dora's father is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate Dora's father's age like this:

1. Twice Dora's age is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).
2. Eight more than that is \(30 + 8 = 38\).

So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, we subtract 4 from Dora's father's age:

1. Dora's mother's age is \(38 - 4 = 34\).

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

1. Dora's age is 15.
2. Dora's father's age is 38.
3. Dora's mother's age is 34.

Adding these together: \(15 + 38 + 34 = 87\).

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{87}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Cindy has:
- 2 math books, each 2 pounds, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- 2 science books, each 2 pounds, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pounds.
- 1 French book that weighs 4 pounds.
- 1 English book that weighs 3 pounds.
- 1 history book that weighs twice as much as the English book, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pounds.

Now, let's add up all the weights:
- Math and science books: \(4 + 4 = 8\) pounds.
- French book: 4 pounds.
- English book: 3 pounds.
- History book: 6 pounds.

Adding these together:
\[8 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 21\]

So, the total weight of all the books Cindy is carrying is 21 pounds. The final answer is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for candidate C's votes.

First, we know that candidate A got 20% of the votes. If there were 100 voters, then:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate A got 20 votes.

Next, candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. To find out how many more votes that is, we calculate 50% of candidate A's votes:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate B got 10 more votes than candidate A, which means:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, we know the total number of votes is 100. To find out how many votes candidate C got, we subtract the votes of candidates A and B from the total:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

So, candidate C got 50 votes.

The number of votes candidate C got is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Boris starts with 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so we calculate how many apples Beck has:
\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \]
So, Beck starts with 77 apples.

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Boris now has:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \]
And Beck now has:
\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \]

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:
\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much water Peter has left.

First, we need to calculate how much water Peter uses for each type of cube:

1. For the giant cubes:
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - So, the total water used for giant cubes is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

2. For the medium cubes:
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - So, the total water used for medium cubes is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

3. For the small cubes:
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - So, the total water used for small cubes is \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we add up all the water used for the cubes:
- Total water used = water for giant cubes + water for medium cubes + water for small cubes
- Total water used = 12 ounces + 14 ounces + 4 ounces = 30 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
- Water left = initial amount - total water used
- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left. The correct answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We know Clara has 20 books. Clara has twice as many books as Steven, so Steven must have half of Clara's books. That means:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much a half-gallon jar costs. We know that a gallon jar costs $5 and it costs $2 less than a half-gallon jar. So, we subtract $2 from $5 to find the cost of a half-gallon jar:

\[ 5 - 2 = 3 \]

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Next, we need to calculate how much Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

1. **Cost of 10-gallon jars:**
   - Each gallon jar costs $5.
   - So, 10 gallon jars cost \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) dollars.

2. **Cost of 16 half-gallon jars:**
   - Each half-gallon jar costs $3.
   - So, 16 half-gallon jars cost \( 16 \times 3 = 48 \) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount Cecelia spent:

\[ 50 + 48 = 98 \]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is $98.

The correct answer is: **$98**"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We know there are 50 students in total. Out of these, 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like either video games or music is \(50 - 10 - 5 = 35\).

The problem also tells us that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now, we know that the total number of students who like video games or music is 35. If 10 students like to play music, then the rest must like to play video games. So, the number of students who like to play video games is \(35 - 10 = 25\).

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Jeremy saw 12 birds in his backyard. When he threw a stone, he scared away 1 out of every 3 birds. So, he scared away \( \frac{12}{3} = 4 \) birds. That means \( 12 - 4 = 8 \) birds were left.

A little while later, 20 more birds came to join the backyard. So, the total number of birds now is \( 8 + 20 = 28 \).

So, the total number of birds in the backyard now is 28."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know there are 80 students in total, and they are divided into two classes with the same number of students in each class. So, each class has:
\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

In each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find out how many girls are in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
\[ 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Since each class has 40 students and 16 of them are girls, the rest must be boys. So, the number of boys in each class is:
\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"Let's go through the problem step by step:

"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Melissa has to groom different types of animals this week:
- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

First, we need to find out how many animals in total she has to groom. We add these numbers together:
\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Melissa has 28 animals to groom in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide the total number of animals by 7 to find out how many animals she grooms each day:
\[ 28 \div 7 = 4 \]

So, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mark buys 3 packs of magic cards for $1800 each. So, the total cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \text{ dollars} \]

He gets 1 card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. So, the total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + (30 \times 50) = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much profit Mark made, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Mark made is:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the amusement parks.

First, we need to find out how much it would cost to go to the first amusement park. The first park has:
- $26 fee for each adult
- $12 fee for each child

Jake's family has 2 adults and 2 children. So, we calculate:
- Cost for 2 adults: \(2 \times 26 = 52\)
- Cost for 2 children: \(2 \times 12 = 24\)

Now, we add these costs together to find the total cost for the first park:
\[52 + 24 = 76\]

Next, we calculate the cost for the second amusement park:
- The second park has:
  - $14 fee for each adult
  - $10 fee for each child

So, we calculate:
- Cost for 2 adults: \(2 \times 14 = 28\)
- Cost for 2 children: \(2 \times 10 = 20\)

Now, we add these costs together to find the total cost for the second park:
\[28 + 20 = 48\]

To find out how much they can save by choosing the second park, we subtract the cost of the second park from the cost of the first park:
\[76 - 48 = 28\]

So, Jake's family will save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park."
"To find out how much money the tomato vendor saves a week, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how much the vendor spends on tomatoes each day. He used to buy 500 tomatoes a day at $0.5 each, so:

\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, with the new vendor, he buys the same 500 tomatoes a day but at $0.4 each, so:

\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

The difference in cost each day is:

\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly savings are:

\[ \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$350/\text{week} \]

So, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Sean has 56 marbles. The problem tells us that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. So, we calculate Carl's marbles like this:

\[ 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

So, Carl has 224 marbles.

Next, the problem says Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. If Sean has 56 marbles, then Cal must have twice as many marbles as Sean:

\[ 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

So, Cal has 112 marbles.

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have together, we add their marbles:

\[ 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined. The final answer is 336."
"To solve this, let's think about it step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students would be in each group if the activity is divided into 12 groups. We have 54 students, and we want to divide them into 12 groups equally.

1. Calculate the number of students per group if there are 12 groups:
   \[
   \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group}
   \]

Since we can't have half a student in a group, this means we can't divide the students into 12 groups of equal size. So, we need to think about the other option, which is dividing them into 6 groups.

2. Calculate the number of students per group if there are 6 groups:
   \[
   \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group}
   \]

This works because 9 is a whole number, so we can divide the students into 6 groups of 9 students each.

3. Now, we need to find out how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups. We already have 6 groups, so:
   \[
   12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ more groups}
   \]

So, we need 6 more groups to form 12 groups in total.

The final answer is:

"To find out how many chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many chairs Candy rents out in one 4-week month. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. So, in 4 weeks, there are:
- 5 weekdays/day * 4 days/week = 20 weekdays
- 2 weekend days/day * 4 days/week = 8 weekend days

Now, let's calculate the chairs rented out:
- On weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs each day. So, in 20 weekdays, she rents out 60 chairs/day * 20 days = 1200 chairs.
- On weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs each day. So, in 8 weekend days, she rents out 100 chairs/day * 8 days = 800 chairs.

Adding these together, the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month is:
1200 chairs (weekdays) + 800 chairs (weekends) = 2000 chairs.

Since we are looking at two 4-week months, we multiply the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
2000 chairs * 2 = 4000 chairs.

So, the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months is 4000 chairs. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{4000}

\frac{100}{4} = 25
\]

So, each roommate pays $25 each month.

Next, we need to find out how much each roommate pays in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly amount by 12:

\[
25 \times 12 = 300
\]

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 times 12, so that's 96 glasses.
- 4 dozen plates, which is 4 times 12, so that's 48 plates.

When the items were returned, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. So, we need to subtract these broken items from the total sent.

For the glasses:
- Total glasses sent: 96
- Broken glasses: 10
- Remaining glasses: 96 - 10 = 86

For the plates:
- Total plates sent: 48
- Broken plates: 6
- Remaining plates: 48 - 6 = 42

Now, to find out how many items Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates:
- Remaining glasses: 86
- Remaining plates: 42
- Total remaining items: 86 + 42 = 128

So, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now. The final answer is 128."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. So, she trades 90% of 30 small stickers, which is 27 small stickers. Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she gets 27 large buttons in return.

Now, she has 3 small stickers left and 40 - 27 = 13 large stickers left.

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. So, she trades 50% of 13 large stickers, which is 6.5. Since she can't trade half a sticker, we'll assume she trades 6 large stickers (rounding down). Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, so trading 6 large stickers gives her 6 large buttons.

Now, she has 13 - 6 = 7 large stickers left. She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small buttons, so trading 7 large stickers gives her 7 * 3 = 21 small buttons.

Now, let's add up all the buttons she has:
- Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27
- Large buttons from trading large stickers: 6
- Small buttons from trading large stickers: 21

So, the total number of buttons she has is 27 + 6 + 21 = 54.

The final answer is 54 buttons."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
He played 1 match on Friday.
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, let's add up all the matches:
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 4 matches

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(2 + 1 + 4 = 7\).

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. The problem tells us that the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it. Let's say the number of votes against the new regulation is \( x \). Then the number of votes in favor would be \( 2x \).

So, the total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, there are 11 votes against the new regulation. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, we have:
\[ 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{22}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Krissa needs to order shirts for her preschool students. We know the number of students needing each size:

- 11 students need size extra-small (XS).
- Twice as many students need size small (S) as extra small (XS), so that's 2 times 11, which is 22 students.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium (M), so that's 22 - 4 = 18 students.
- Half as many students need size large (L) as size medium, so that's 18 / 2 = 9 students.
- Six more students need size extra-large (XL) than large, so that's 9 + 6 = 15 students.

Now, we add up all these numbers to find out how many shirts Krissa needs to order:

11 (XS) + 22 (S) + 18 (M) + 9 (L) + 15 (XL) = 75

So, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total. The answer is 75."
"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to calculate how much the discount is. A 5% discount means you save 5 cents for every dollar. So, for $140, you save:

\[ 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

This means you save $7. So, you will pay the original price minus the discount:

\[ 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, the amount you will pay after the discount is $133."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John has 20 playlists, and each playlist has 300 songs. So, to find out how many songs are there in total, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist:
\[ 20 \times 300 = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Now, each song is 10 hours long. To find out the total number of hours for all the songs, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:
\[ 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is:
\[ \boxed{60000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10 \text{ people} \]

2. So, after 10 people think horse #2 will win, the remaining number of people is:
   \[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people} \]

3. Next, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[ 60\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 24 \text{ people} \]

4. So, after 24 people think horse #7 will win, the remaining number of people is:
   \[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's call the total number of puppies \( P \). So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

We also know that one third of these Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So we can write:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = 6 \]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 9 and then dividing by 2:
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has a total of 27 puppies. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Jayden had $70 from selling pictures. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200. To find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the money he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85. So, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera. The answer is:

\boxed{85}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Let's say the second house needs \( x \) cases of shingles. Then:

- The first house needs half of the second house, so it needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so it needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

So, the total number of cases is:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

George has 200 bananas. He has 45% more pears than bananas. To find out how many pears he has, we first need to calculate 45% of 200 bananas.

\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than 200 bananas. That means he has:

\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \text{ pears} \]

Now, to find out the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears together:

\[ 200 \text{ bananas} + 290 \text{ pears} = 490 \text{ fruits} \]

So, the total number of fruits George has is 490."
"Marissa had $80 and she spent $20 on a ball. So, she had $60 left. Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars she can buy, we divide the money she has left by the cost of one candy bar:

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy. The answer is 12."
"To find out how much money Sam would need to make 4 liters of juice, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we know that 1 liter of juice needs 5 kilograms of oranges.
2. So, for 4 liters of juice, Sam would need:
   \[
   4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kilograms/liter} = 20 \text{ kilograms of oranges}
   \]
3. Each kilogram of oranges costs $3.
4. Therefore, the cost for 20 kilograms of oranges is:
   \[
   20 \text{ kilograms} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 60 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's break it down in a simpler way.

We know that in one hour, Ezra read 300 books. The problem also tells us that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. So, if Ahmed read \( A \) books, then Ezra read \( 2A \) books. Since Ezra read 300 books, we can say:

\[ 2A = 300 \]

To find out how many books Ahmed read, we divide 300 by 2:

\[ A = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, we need to find out how many books they read altogether. We add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read:

\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

So, the total number of books they read together is 450.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{450}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for Monday and Wednesday to find out how much Tanya earned.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each day.
- She earns $15 for each hour.
- She also gets an extra $5 if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Since she teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, she gets an extra $5:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each day.
- She earns $15 for each hour.
- She doesn't get the extra $5 because she teaches only 2 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Now, add up the earnings for both days:
\[ \$305 + \$60 = \$365 \]

So, Tanya earned a total of \(\boxed{365}\) dollars for these two days of teaching."
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, let's see how many vanilla scents were sold. The company sold 5 vanilla scents each time, and they did this 5 times. So, we multiply 5 by 5:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]
So, 25 vanilla scents were sold.

Next, let's see how many fruity scents were sold. The company sold 2 fruity scents each time, and they did this 2 times. So, we multiply 2 by 2:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]
So, 4 fruity scents were sold.

Now, to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
\[ 25 - 4 = 21 \]

So, 21 more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents. The final answer is:

\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

So, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{C. } \$3 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so in total, she has 12 hours over the weekend.

She spends 3 hours reading. So, the remaining time is:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

She then spends 1/3 of the remaining time on video games. So, the time she spends on video games is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we subtract the time spent on reading and video games from the total weekend time to find out how much time she spends playing soccer:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours (reading)} - 3 \text{ hours (video games)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
\[ \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Anthony started with 50 pencils. He gave half of them to Brandon. So, he gave:

\[

\]

After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, Anthony had:

\[
50 - 25 = 25 \text{ pencils left}
\]

Then, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie. So, he gave:

\[

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to add the time he spends driving to the museum and the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the return trip is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back home is also 2 hours. So, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours. The correct answer is:

"Henry needs wheels for 57 cars and 73 motorcycles. Each car needs 4 wheels, so for 57 cars, he needs:
\[ 57 \times 4 = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, so for 73 motorcycles, he needs:
\[ 73 \times 2 = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Adding these together, the total number of wheels needed is:
\[ 228 + 146 = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels are left after he uses 374 wheels, we subtract:

So, after the discount, you have to pay $800.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{800} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mike has 600 movies in total. A third of these are in series, so:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]
So, 200 movies are in series.

This means the rest of the movies are not in series:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \]
So, 400 movies are not in series.

Out of these 400 movies, 40% are older movies:
\[ 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]
So, 160 movies are older.

That leaves:
\[ 400 - 160 = 240 \]
So, 240 movies are not older.

Now, let's calculate the cost:
- The series movies cost $6 each:
\[ 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]
- The non-older movies cost $10 each:
\[ 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]
- The older movies cost $5 each:
\[ 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Adding these up:
\[ 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400 \]

So, the total cost to replace the movies is:
\[ \boxed{4400} \]"
"To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to add up the cost of the peaches, plums, and apricots he picked.

First, let's calculate the cost of the peaches:
- He picked 6 pounds of peaches.
- Peaches cost $2.00 per pound.
- So, the cost for peaches is \(6 \times 2 = 12\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the plums:
- He picked 8 pounds of plums.
- Plums cost $1.00 per pound.
- So, the cost for plums is \(8 \times 1 = 8\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the apricots:
- He picked 6 pounds of apricots.
- Apricots cost $3.00 per pound.
- So, the cost for apricots is \(6 \times 3 = 18\) dollars.

Now, we add up the costs of all the fruits:
- Cost of peaches: $12.00
- Cost of plums: $8.00
- Cost of apricots: $18.00

Adding these together: \(12 + 8 + 18 = 38\) dollars.

So, Winston spent a total of \(\boxed{38}\) dollars on fruit."
"To find out how far the vacation spot is, we need to add the distance they drove to the distance they hiked.

First, let's calculate the distance they drove:
- They drove for 6 hours at a speed of 50 miles per hour.
- So, the distance they drove is 50 miles/hour × 6 hours = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance they hiked:
- They hiked for 1.5 hours.
- Their hiking speed is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half of their driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
- So, their hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
- Therefore, the distance they hiked is 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance they drove to the distance they hiked:
- Total distance = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

So, the vacation spot is 330 miles away. The correct answer is 330 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out the difference in their scores.

Ava and Emma are playing a video game level. They get points for jumping on enemies, collecting berries, and finishing the level quickly. Here's what we know:

- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Now, let's calculate the points for each player:

1. **Points from enemies:**
   - Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
   - So, Ava gets \(10 \times 8 = 80\) points from enemies.

2. **Points from berries:**
   - Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
   - So, Ava gets \(5 \times 3 = 15\) points from berries.

3. **Points from time left:**
   - Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma.
   - So, Ava loses \(30 \times 4 = 120\) points from the time left.

Now, let's add up Ava's total points:
\[ 80 \text{ (enemies)} + 15 \text{ (berries)} - 120 \text{ (time)} = 80 + 15 - 120 = 95 - 120 = -25 \]

Next, let's calculate Emma's total points:

1. **Points from enemies:**
   - Emma jumps on \(E_E\) enemies.
   - So, Emma gets \(10 \times (E_E - (E_E + 8)) = 10 \times (-8) = -80\) points from enemies.

2. **Points from berries:**
   - Emma collects \(B_E\) berries.
   - So, Emma gets \(5 \times (B_E - (B_E + 3)) = 5 \times (-3) = -15\) points from berries.

3. **Points from time left:**
   - Emma finishes 4 seconds faster than Ava.
   - So, Emma gets \(30 \times (-4) = -120\) points from the time left.

Now, let's add up Emma's total points:
\[ -80 \text{ (enemies)} - 15 \text{ (berries)} - 120 \text{ (time)} = -80 - 15 - 120 = -215 \]

Finally, let's find the difference in their scores:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Ava's score} - \text{Emma's score} = -25 - (-215) = -25 + 215 = 190 \]

So, the difference between their scores is 190 points. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{190} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that two pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so together they cost:
\[ 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we know the total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. So, the cost for the other two pizzas together is:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

So, each of the other two pizzas costs:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day on the usual days. They do this for 5 days. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On two other days, they ride their bikes twice as much as usual. So, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
And they do this for 2 days, so:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Bob originally had 7 fish in his pond: 3 were orange and 4 were white.

At the pet store, he got 17 fish in total. We need to figure out how many of these were white and how many were orange so that after adding them to his pond, he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Let's say he got \( w \) white fish and \( o \) orange fish. So, \( w + o = 17 \).

After adding these fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + w \).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so we have:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Now, substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ w + (2w + 5) = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find out how many orange fish he bought, we use \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

Now, let's check if this works:
- After adding the fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \).
- The number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- And indeed, 16 is twice 8.

So, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

Andy drives to work and back home each day. The distance to work is 5 miles one way, so the round trip is 5 miles * 2 = 10 miles. He does this from Monday to Friday, so that's 5 days a week. That means he drives 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles per week.

His car gets 10 miles per gallon, so to find out how many gallons he uses, we divide the total miles by the miles per gallon: 50 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons/week.

Now, if gas costs $3 per gallon, then for 5 gallons, the cost is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 worth of gas per week. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Carrie has ten twenties, and each twenty is worth $20. So, the total for the twenties is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She also has 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the total for the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35. She also spent 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount she spent is:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Ricardo has tomato plants and eggplant plants in his garden. Each tomato plant gives him 22 tomatoes, and each eggplant plant gives him 4 eggplants. He has 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants.

First, let's find out how many tomatoes he gets:
- Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes.
- He has 5 tomato plants.
- So, the total number of tomatoes is \(5 \times 22 = 110\).

Next, let's find out how many eggplants he gets:
- Each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants.
- He has 8 eggplant plants.
- So, the total number of eggplants is \(8 \times 4 = 32\).

Now, to find out the total number of fruits, we add the tomatoes and the eggplants together:
- Total fruits = Total tomatoes + Total eggplants
- Total fruits = 110 + 32 = 142.

So, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is 142."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Samwell sold a total of 40 TVs. One-fourth of these are smart TVs, and one-eighth are analog TVs. We need to find out how many are OLED TVs.

First, let's calculate the number of smart TVs:
- One-fourth of 40 is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \) TVs.

Next, let's calculate the number of analog TVs:
- One-eighth of 40 is \( \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \) TVs.

Now, to find out how many are OLED TVs, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total:
- Total TVs sold = 40
- Smart TVs = 10
- Analog TVs = 5

So, the number of OLED TVs is:
- OLED TVs = Total TVs - (Smart TVs + Analog TVs)
- OLED TVs = 40 - (10 + 5)
- OLED TVs = 40 - 15
- OLED TVs = 25

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The trip costs $300.
2. The school is going to cover half of that, so the school will pay $300 / 2 = $150.
3. John already has $50.
4. To find out how much more money John needs, we subtract the money he has from what the school is covering: $150 - $50 = $100.

So, John is missing $100. 

The correct answer is: **$100**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the house gets cold at night and we need to raise the temperature to 32 degrees to keep the pipes from freezing. During the day, the temperature is 45 degrees. At night, it's 33 degrees colder than during the day, so we can calculate the night temperature like this:

\[ 45 \text{ degrees} - 33 \text{ degrees} = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we need to find out how much the temperature needs to be raised to 32 degrees. The difference is:

\[ 32 \text{ degrees} - 12 \text{ degrees} = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide 20 by 5:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ degrees}}{5 \text{ degrees/log}} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to keep the pipes from freezing. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have 90 people and they need to form groups of 9 people each. So, we divide 90 by 9 to find out how many groups we can make:
\[ 90 \div 9 = 10 \]
So, we can make 10 groups.

Now, we know that 3/5 of these groups brought back seashells. To find out how many groups that is, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]
So, 6 groups brought back seashells.

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells. So, we multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by 2 to find the total number of seashells:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of seashells they brought back is 12.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Initially, there are 172 people on the train. At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:

\[ 172 - 47 = 125 \]

Then, 13 more people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125:

\[ 125 + 13 = 138 \]

At the next stop, 38 people get off the train, so we subtract 38 from 138:

\[ 138 - 38 = 100 \]

So, the number of people on the train after the second stop is 100. 

Therefore, the final answer is 100."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day. If he does this for 30 days, we can find out how many bottle caps he gets in total by doing:

\[ 10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Each bottle cap is worth $0.25. So, to find out how much money he gets, we multiply the number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:

\[ 300 \text{ bottle caps} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$75 \]

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Jamie's pay.

Jamie earns $20 per hour for her regular 8 hours of work. So, for those 8 hours, she earns:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

For the additional hours, she worked 11 hours in total, so she worked:
\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \text{ additional hours} \]

Her special hourly rate for additional hours is 150% of her regular rate. So, her special hourly rate is:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

For the 3 additional hours, she earns:
\[ 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out her total pay for the day, we add her regular pay and her additional pay:
\[ 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on last Tuesday."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

There are also 14 lion cubs. To find the total number of lions, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together:
\[ \text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 \]

So, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Mike needed a new pair of jeans that originally cost $40.00, but they were on sale for 25% off. To find out how much he saved, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00 \]

So, the jeans cost him $10.00 less than the original price. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find out how much he paid:

\[ 40.00 - 10.00 = 30.00 \]

Mike paid $30.00 for the jeans. He paid with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the $50.00:

\[ 50.00 - 30.00 = 20.00 \]

So, Mike will have $20.00 left over. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{20.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. The company starts with 200 employees.
2. Every month, they hire 20 new employees. So after 3 months, they will have hired \(20 \times 3 = 60\) new employees.
3. The total number of employees after 3 months will be \(200 + 60 = 260\).
4. Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total salary for all employees each month is \(260 \times 4000 = 1040000\) dollars.
5. Over 3 months, the total amount of money paid to all employees is \(1040000 \times 3 = 3120000\) dollars.

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3120000.

The final answer is: **3120000**"
"To find out how long they will be caroling, we need to add up the time for singing ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells.""

First, let's calculate the time for ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, and each time it takes 150 seconds.
- So, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is \(2 \times 150 = 300\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the time for ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once, and it takes 240 seconds.
- So, the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs:
- Total time = Time for ""Deck the Halls"" + Time for ""Jingle Bells""
- Total time = 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.

So, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{540}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Billy and Sally's earnings.

First, we need to find out how much Billy earns in total for 20 hours of work.

1. **Billy's initial hourly wage is $10.**
2. **After 2 months, his wage increases to $10.50.**
3. **On his first anniversary, his wage increases to $11.50.**

Now, let's calculate how much Billy earns in total for 20 hours of work:
- For the first 2 months (40 hours), he earns $10 per hour.
  \[
  40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- After 2 months, his wage increases to $10.50 per hour for the next 20 hours.
  \[
  20 \text{ hours} \times 10.50 \text{ dollars/hour} = 210 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- So, his total earnings for 20 hours are:
  \[
  400 \text{ dollars} + 210 \text{ dollars} = 610 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, let's look at Sally's earnings:
- Sally's starting hourly wage is $0.50 more than Billy's initial wage, so it's $10.50.
- For 20 hours of work, Sally earns:
  \[
  20 \text{ hours} \times 10.50 \text{ dollars/hour} = 210 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally:
\[
610 \text{ dollars} - 210 \text{ dollars} = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Billy earns $400 more than Sally in 20 hours of work. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{400}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

First, we need to find out how much 3 loaves of bread cost. Each loaf costs $2, so:
\[ 3 \text{ loaves} \times \$2 \text{ per loaf} = \$6 \]

Next, we need to find out how much 2 bagels cost. Each bagel costs $1, so:
\[ 2 \text{ bagels} \times \$1 \text{ per bagel} = \$2 \]

Now, we want to know how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels. We subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the loaves:
\[ \$6 - \$2 = \$4 \]

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Pierson scored 278 points. Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score. First, we need to find out half of Pierson's score:

Half of Pierson's score = 278 / 2 = 139 points

Now, Nikita scored 11 more than this, so:

Nikita's score = 139 + 11 = 150 points

To find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:

Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score = 278 + 150 = 428 points

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428 points. 

The correct answer is 428."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

First, we need to find out how many students and teachers there are in total.

The school has 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

Next, each class has 3 teachers:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Now, we know that each student plants 1 tree and each teacher plants 2 trees.

So, the total number of trees planted by the students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

And the total number of trees planted by the teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding these together gives us the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

So, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:
\[ \boxed{1240} \]"
"Bubbles has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. That makes a total of 14 stuffed animals.

She wants the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. To find out how many stuffed goats she needs, we can set up an equation.

If she buys \( x \) stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the number of goats to be 30% of the total number of stuffed animals, so:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30 \times x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Now, let's get all the \( x \) terms on one side:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats to make up 30% of her total collection of stuffed animals.

The number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. She has already played for half an hour every day for 2 weeks and 2 hours every day for a week.

First, let's calculate how many hours she played in the first 2 weeks. Since there are 14 days in 2 weeks and she plays 0.5 hours each day, she played:
\[ 14 \times 0.5 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, for the last week, she plays 2 hours each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, she played:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours she has already played:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how many more hours she needs to play to reach 30 hours, we subtract the hours she has already played from the total hours needed:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

So, Kris still needs to play 9 more hours to earn the achievement. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

First, let's calculate the distance the first car travels:
- The first car travels at 60 miles per hour.
- It travels for 2 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance the second car travels:
- The second car travels at 70 miles per hour.
- It also travels for 2 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles.

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
- Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles.
- Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles.
- Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The answer is 20 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

James buys a ring that costs $600 for the diamond and $300 for the gold. So, the total cost before adding the premium is:
\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

The premium is 30% of the total cost before the premium. To find 30% of $900, we calculate:
\[ 0.30 \times 900 = 270 \]

So, the total cost after adding the premium is:
\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

Therefore, James paid \(\boxed{1170}\) dollars for the ring."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find the overall pass rate for the school.

First, we need to find the pass rates for each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass rate:**
   - 340 out of 500 third-graders passed.
   - To find the pass rate, we divide the number of pass students by the total number of students: \( \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \).
   - So, 68% of third-graders passed.

2. **Fourth-grade pass rate:**
   - 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed.
   - To find the pass rate, we divide the number of pass students by the total number of students: \( \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \).
   - So, 40% of fourth-graders passed.

3. **Fifth-grade pass rate:**
   - The fifth-grade pass rate is twice the fourth-grade pass rate.
   - Fourth-grade pass rate is 40%, so fifth-grade pass rate is \( 2 \times 40\% = 80\% \).
   - This means 80% of fifth-graders passed.

Now, let's find out how many students passed in each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass students:**
   - 340 third-graders passed.

2. **Fourth-grade pass students:**
   - 40 fourth-graders passed.

3. **Fifth-grade pass students:**
   - 80% of 400 fifth-graders passed, which is \( 0.80 \times 400 = 320 \) fifth-graders.

Next, we add up the total number of students who passed:

- Third-grade pass students: 340
- Fourth-grade pass students: 40
- Fifth-grade pass students: 320

Total number of pass students: \( 340 + 40 + 320 = 700 \)

Now, we find the total number of students tested:

- Third-graders: 500
- Fourth-graders: 100
- Fifth-graders: 400

Total number of students: \( 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 \)

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

- Overall pass rate: \( \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \) or 70%

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

The correct answer is: **70%**"
"Milo needs 12 glass chips to make one square inch of his mosaic. He has two bags of chips, and each bag has 72 chips. So, he has a total of:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Each square inch of the mosaic requires 12 chips, so with 144 chips, he can make:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how long the mosaic can be, we use the area of the mosaic. The area is the product of the length and the height. Let's say the length of the mosaic is \( L \) inches. The area is:

\[ L \times 3 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

So,

\[ L = \frac{12 \text{ square inches}}{3 \text{ inches}} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 4 students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea. So, the total tea they drank is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Next, 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea. So, the total tea they drank is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that after all this, there are 10 quarts of tea left. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, but he only had 100 candies to begin with, so he ran out of his initial order. Then he ordered 100 more candies. Now he has 100 (initial order) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies in total.

He has already sold 150 candies, so he needs to sell 200 (total candies now) - 150 (candies sold) = 50 more candies to sell all of his candy.

So, the number of candies Dale still needs to sell is 50.

The answer is: **50**"
"To find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, let's go step by step.

At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students. The number of students doubles every month.

- At the end of January, the number of students is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).
- At the end of February, the number of students is \(20 \times 2 = 40\).
- At the end of March, the number of students is \(40 \times 2 = 80\).
- At the end of April, the number of students is \(80 \times 2 = 160\).
- At the end of May, the number of students is \(160 \times 2 = 320\).

Now, to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, we subtract the number of students at the beginning of the year from the number of students at the end of May.

So, the number of additional students is \(320 - 10 = 310\).

Therefore, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is \(\boxed{310}\)."
"Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made $105 during the week. To find out how many branches he climbed, we divide the total money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ 105 \div 0.25 = 420 \]

So, Felix climbed 420 branches in total during the week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total branches by 7 to find out how many branches he climbed on average each day:

\[ 420 \div 7 = 60 \]

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The answer is 60."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Rose starts by picking 3 flowers, each with 5 petals. So, she picks:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Next, she picks 4 flowers, each with 6 petals. So, she picks:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

Then, she picks 5 flowers, each with 4 petals. So, she picks:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

Lastly, she picks 6 flowers, each with 7 petals. So, she picks:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Now, let's add all these petals together:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Rose drops 1 flower of each type, so she drops:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we subtract the dropped petals from the total:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The bag starts with 35 marshmallows.
2. John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean makes 9 S'mores. So, they use 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.
3. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is 18 + 3 = 21.
4. After using and dropping 21 marshmallows, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 21 = 14.
5. With 14 marshmallows left, and since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they can each have 14 ÷ 2 = 7 S'mores.

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.

The final answer is: **7** S'mores."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. He plays for 20 minutes. That's 1 quarter.

Two of his friends can only play for half as long as Jack, so they each play for 10 minutes. Together, they play for 10 + 10 = 20 minutes. That's 1 quarter for each of them, so 2 quarters in total.

The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he plays for 30 minutes. That's 1.5 quarters.

Now, let's add up all the quarters they use:
- Jack uses 1 quarter.
- The two worse friends use 2 quarters.
- The better friend uses 1.5 quarters.

So, the total number of quarters used is 1 + 2 + 1.5 = 4.5 quarters.

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 4.5 quarters. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{4.5}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the same amount of salt as sugar, twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest. We also know the total mixture is 10 ounces.

Let's say the amount of salt (and sugar) is \( S \) ounces. Then:
- The amount of oil is \( 2S \) ounces.
- The amount of fragrance is \( S \) ounces.
- The amount of citrus zest is \( S \) ounces.

So, the total mixture is:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, the amount of oil is \( 2S \):
\[ 2S = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, Tanya uses \(\frac{10}{3}\) ounces of oil. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John bought 3 goats, and each goat cost $500. So, for the goats, he spent:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, John bought 2 cows, and each cow cost $1500. So, for the cows, he spent:
\[ 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money John spent in total, we add the cost of the goats and the cows together:
\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John spent a total of $4500. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4500} \]"
"Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. So, he has a total of 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes. He needs 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more cupcakes he should buy, we subtract the cupcakes he already has from the total he needs:

63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. The answer is 15."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. So, he sells \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

Then, he gives away twice as many cars as he sold, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

So, after selling 8 cars, Joe has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars left.

Then, after giving away 16 cars, Joe has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars left.

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with is 16.

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To find out how much each student raised, we first need to know how much money the students raised. The total money raised by the charity is $175,000, and $50,000 of that came from organizations. So, the students raised:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Now, there are 20 students, and they all raised the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

So, each student raised $6,250. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{6250} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which means she walked 4 hours on the second day.

To find out the total time she walked, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to convert hours into minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{720}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Hunter first counted 50 cars in the parking lot. Then, during the first break, he saw 20 more cars. So, the total number of cars was 50 + 20 = 70 cars.

During the lunch break, half of these cars left the parking lot. So, we need to find out half of 70. Half of 70 is 70 ÷ 2 = 35.

So, the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

The answer is: **35**"
"To find out how much John makes in a week, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know John does 30 cycles of work each day. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, let's calculate how much he makes in one day.

1. Calculate the number of tasks John does in one day:
   - He does 30 cycles a day.
   - Each cycle has 5 tasks.
   - So, the total number of tasks he does in one day is:
     \[
     30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} = 150 \text{ tasks/day}
     \]

2. Now, let's find out how much he earns in one day:
   - Each task pays $1.20.
   - So, the total amount he earns in one day is:
     \[
     150 \text{ tasks/day} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$180/\text{day}
     \]

3. To find out how much he earns in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week:
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - So, the total amount he earns in a week is:
     \[
     \$180/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$1260
     \]

So, John makes \$1260 in a full 7-day week. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{1260}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

In the first game:
- Sasha scored 14 points.
- Julie scored 4 points less than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.

In the second game:
- Julie scored 10 points in the first game.
- Sasha scored 6 points less than Julie in the second game, so Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points.

Now, let's add up Sasha's points from both games:
- First game: 14 points
- Second game: 4 points
- Total points: \(14 + 4 = 18\) points

So, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games. The final answer is 18."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package has 11 tins. So, the total number of tins of cat food is:
\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins} \]

She also bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package has 6 tins. So, the total number of tins of dog food is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins} \]

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food she bought, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \text{ tins} \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total number of cards is 341. Let's say PJ has \( P \) cards. Then Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards because Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has. Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards because Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.

So, the total number of cards can be written as:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Now, let's find out how many cards Smendrick has:
\[ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \]

And how many cards Becca has:
\[ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \]

Therefore, Becca has 153 cards. The final answer is \(\boxed{153}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

Cindy has 5 green eggs. She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs. She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so that's \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs. And she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

So, the total number of eggs is \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the total number of eggs Cindy has is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money Milly will lose.

First, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. So, for the weight of the book:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35 \text{ per pound} = \$1.40 \]

Next, the book needs to be sent 20 miles away, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile. So, for the distance:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08 \text{ per mile} = \$1.60 \]

Now, we add the cost for the weight and the cost for the distance to get the total shipping cost:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

The book Milly bought cost $32. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the purchase price, we calculate the refundable amount:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24 \]

Now, we find out how much Milly will lose by subtracting the refundable amount from the total cost:
\[ \$32 + \$3.00 - \$24 = \$11.00 \]

So, Milly will lose \(\boxed{11}\) dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Mulan starts with $40. Her father gives her $100, so she has:
\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

She then buys two pairs of jeans. Each pair costs $30, so two pairs cost:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

She also buys a bag for $20. So, the total cost of the jeans and the bag is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from the money she had:
\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

So, the amount of money Mulan has left is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Boris makes 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. We know how many he makes in the first three weeks:

- In the first week, he makes 8,000 bars.
- In the second week, he makes half of the first week, so that's 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.
- In the third week, he makes three times the first week, so that's 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.

Now, let's add up the bars he made in the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since he makes 50,000 bars in a month, we subtract the 36,000 bars he made in the first three weeks from the total:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, Boris makes 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.

The final answer is 14,000 bars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month.

First, we need to calculate the time Britany spends on TikTok videos each week. She records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. So, we multiply the number of videos by the time each video takes:
\[ 18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we add the time she spends writing songs. She spends 2 hours a week writing songs. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, we convert 2 hours to minutes:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Then, we add the time she spends doing her makeup. She spends 15 minutes six days a week. So, we multiply the time by the number of days:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, we add up all the time she spends on TikTok-related activities each week:
\[ 72 \text{ minutes/week} + 120 \text{ minutes/week} + 90 \text{ minutes/week} = 282 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4 to find the monthly total:
\[ 282 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the total minutes into hours. Since 60 minutes make an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
\[ \frac{1128 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 18.8 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month is 18.8 hours. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{18.8 \text{ hours}} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

First, we know the base cost for the installation is $129. This cost includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Now, Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

We need to find out how many extra items she needs to have installed.

For the mirrors:
- She needs 6 and they already have 4, so she needs 2 more.
- The cost for 2 more mirrors is 2 times $15, which is $30.

For the chandeliers:
- She needs 2 and they already have 1, so she needs 1 more.
- The cost for 1 more chandelier is 1 times $15, which is $15.

For the pictures:
- She needs 20 and they already have 10, so she needs 10 more.
- The cost for 10 more pictures is 10 times $15, which is $150.

Now, let's add up all the extra costs:
- Cost for extra mirrors: $30
- Cost for extra chandeliers: $15
- Cost for extra pictures: $150

Total extra cost: $30 + $15 + $150 = $195

Now, we add this to the base cost:
- Base cost: $129
- Total extra cost: $195
- Total cost: $129 + $195 = $324

So, the total cost for Angela is $324."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Eva has saved $20.00.
2. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so Anthony has saved $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00.
3. Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate 40% of $30.00, which is 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00.
4. So, Roy's total savings are Anthony's savings plus the extra 40%, which is $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00.

Therefore, Roy has saved $42.00."
"To find out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the relationships given step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. So, Saskay can lift:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. So, Kagiyami can lift:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. So, Naruto can lift:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we need to convert 480 inches into feet. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we divide 480 inches by 12:
\[
480 \text{ inches} \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]"
"To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we need to add the distance he traveled in the first part of his journey to the distance he traveled in the second part.

First, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the first part:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the second part:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 6 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances from both parts to find the total distance:
- Total Distance = Distance of First Part + Distance of Second Part
- Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles. The correct answer is 80 miles."
"Okay, let's break this down in a simpler way.

If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across a highway, we can find out how far the highway is by multiplying the number of kangaroos by the time they take and their speed. But we don't need the speed to find out how long it will take the turtles.

Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so if it takes 18 hours for 3 kangaroos, it will take longer for 4 turtles because they are slower.

First, let's find out how long it would take 1 turtle to travel the same distance. Since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours, 1 kangaroo would take 3 times longer (because there are 3 kangaroos), so 1 kangaroo would take \(18 \times 3 = 54\) hours.

Now, if each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, it will take twice as long for each turtle to travel the same distance. So, 1 turtle would take \(54 \times 2 = 108\) hours.

Since we have 4 turtles, it will take them 108 hours divided by 4, which is \(108 \div 4 = 27\) hours.

So, it will take 27 hours for 4 turtles to travel across the highway.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

Kora made 20 clay dishes. Rory made 20 more than Kora, so Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 clay dishes. Jada made twice as many as Rory, so Jada made 2 * 40 = 80 clay dishes.

Now, to find out how many they all made together, we add up the number of dishes each of them made:
Kora's 20 + Rory's 40 + Jada's 80 = 140

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down in a simpler way.

Erika wants a new laptop that costs $600. If she trades in her old laptop, the price goes down by $200. So, the new price of the laptop is $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she has $400 - $50 = $350 now.

She got $150 from her part-time job and her mom gave her $80. So, the total money she has from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the money she got from her part-time job and her mom from the total money she needs: $350 - $230 = $120.

So, Erika has $120 in her purse. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Adam has 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, from the large apples, he gets:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Adam has 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, from the small apples, he gets:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, if we add the slices from the large apples and the small apples together, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of apple slices left is 15. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know that each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day.
2. The farmer currently has 3 cows, so they produce:
   \[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]
3. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day.
4. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
   \[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]
5. Since each cow gives 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows are needed to produce the extra 10 liters:
   \[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have three glue sticks, and we need to find out how much glue is left in each one.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. So, the length of the glue left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. So, the length of the glue left is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. So, the length of the glue left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we add up the lengths of the glue that is left:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters. 

The correct answer is \boxed{16}."
"Gabriel wants to buy a car that costs $10000 and a phone that costs $800. He already has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. So, let's add the money he has to the money his brother gave him: $5000 + $200 = $5200.

Now, we need to find out how much more money he needs. The total cost of the car and the phone is $10000 + $800 = $10800.

To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the money he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600.

So, Gabriel still needs $5600. The correct answer is (D) $5600."
"Thea bought a hat worth $70. She gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which is $80 in total. To find out how much change she got, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she gave.

The change Thea got is $10. 

The correct answer is $10."
"Okay, let me break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, so he has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each, so the cost is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, so the cost is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the water balloons:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total cost from the money he started with:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Craig has 19 dollars left. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Jack has 60 dishes.
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so if we let the number of socks Jack has be \( S \), then \( 2S = 60 \). Solving for \( S \), we get \( S = 30 \). So, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, let's add up all the items:
- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, so in total, Jack has \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) items.
- Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes, so in total, Peter has \( 60 + 30 = 90 \) items.
- Together, they have \( 90 + 90 = 180 \) items.

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 20 students in total. Out of these, 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. We need to find out how many students are good at both math and English.

First, let's add the students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only:
\[ 5 \text{ (math only)} + 8 \text{ (English only)} = 13 \]

This means 13 students are either good at math only, good at English only, or good at both. Since there are 20 students in total, the rest must be good at both math and English:
\[ 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English. Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both math and English:
\[ 5 \text{ (math only)} + 7 \text{ (both)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12. The final answer is:

Vicki's concert is 2 hours long, which is 120 minutes. She has a 10-minute intermission, so that leaves 110 minutes for the groups to perform.

Each group has a total time of 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to get off the stage. So, the total time for one group is:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we need to see how many groups can fit into the 110 minutes:
\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find out how much Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the simple interest and then add it to her original investment.

First, let's find out the simple interest. The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Brenda's principal is $300, the rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \), and the time is 3 years.

So, the simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

Let's do the math:
\[ 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]
\[ 675 \times 3 = 2025 \]

So, the simple interest is $2025.

Now, we add this interest to the original amount to find the total:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $2325.

The correct answer is: **2325**"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We have 40 white shirts in total. Half of them have collars, so:
- White shirts with collars: 40 / 2 = 20
- White shirts without collars: 40 - 20 = 20

We also have 50 floral shirts in total. Out of these, 20 have buttons, so:
- Floral shirts with buttons: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars. We already know:
- White shirts without collars: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 30

So, the difference is:
30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray can hold 30 eggs. To find out how many trays he needs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Now, if each tray is sold for $2.5, we need to find out how much he will earn by selling all 30 trays. We do this by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the trays. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{75}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.

He sold 10 goats from Farm X. So, the number of goats left in Farm X is:
\[ 55 - 10 = 45 \]

He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X. So, he sold:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
goats from Farm Y. The number of goats left in Farm Y is:
\[ 45 - 20 = 25 \]

Now, to find out how many goats are left in total, we add the goats left in both farms:
\[ 45 + 25 = 70 \]

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month. In a year, which has 12 months, he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he spends on each pair, we divide the total amount by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of 3 baskets of green food:**
   Each basket of green food costs $25.
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:**
   Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket.
   \[
   18 - 2 = 16 \text{ dollars per basket}
   \]
   \[
   3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost:**
   Add the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food.
   \[
   75 + 48 = 123 \text{ dollars}

So, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We have 90 rooms at the motel, and we need to clean half of them. Half of 90 is 45 rooms.
2. It takes 20 minutes to clean one room. So, to clean 45 rooms, it would take \(45 \times 20 = 900\) minutes.
3. There are 60 minutes in an hour. To convert 900 minutes into hours, we divide by 60: \(900 \div 60 = 15\) hours.

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.

The final answer is 15 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, they build three times the number of homes they built in the first year. So, \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, they count all the homes built in the first two years and then double that number. So, the total homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Doubling this number gives \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Now, to find out how many homes the town has built over the three years, we add the homes built each year:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{144}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how old you are.

1. You are three years younger than your brother, so if your brother is \( B \) years old, you are \( B - 3 \) years old.
2. You are two years older than your sister, so if your sister is \( S \) years old, you are \( S + 2 \) years old.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom is \( 3B - 1 \) years old.
4. The sum of all your ages is 87, so \( B - 3 + B + S + S + 2 + 3B - 1 = 87 \).

Let's simplify the equation:
\[ B - 3 + B + S + S + 2 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 5B + 2S - 2 = 87 \]
\[ 5B + 2S = 89 \]

We also know that \( S = B - 5 \) because you are two years older than your sister. Substitute \( S = B - 5 \) into the equation:
\[ 5B + 2(B - 5) = 89 \]
\[ 5B + 2B - 10 = 89 \]
\[ 7B - 10 = 89 \]
\[ 7B = 99 \]
\[ B = 14 \]

Now, since \( B = 14 \), your age \( Y \) is:
\[ Y = B - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11 \]

So, you are 11 years old. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

Mr. Jackson has 27 students, and he wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. So, he needs:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

The glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks in each pack:
\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he wants to have some extra glue sticks left over, he needs to round up to the next whole number. So, he needs to buy 7 packs.

Therefore, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

On the first day, the river has 4000 gallons of water.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. So, on the second day, the river has \(4000 \times 2 = 8000\) gallons of water.

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons. So, the river has \(8000 + 6000 = 14000\) gallons of water.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is 14000 gallons.

The final answer is: **14000 gallons**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We start with 10 people infected. Each day, each infected person infects 6 others.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- So, \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new infections.
- Total infected people after Day 1: \(10 + 60 = 70\).

**Day 2:**
- Now, there are 70 infected people.
- Each of these 70 people infects 6 others.
- So, \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new infections.
- Total infected people after Day 2: \(70 + 420 = 490\).

**Day 3:**
- Now, there are 490 infected people.
- Each of these 490 people infects 6 others.
- So, \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new infections.
- Total infected people after Day 3: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\).

So, after three days, the total number of infected people is 3430.

The final answer is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Rafaela got as tips. The problem says each of the 40 customers gave her $20. So, we multiply 40 by 20:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rafaela got $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta got. The problem says Julieta got 10% less money than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's money, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta got $80 less than Rafaela. To find out how much Julieta got, we subtract $80 from $800:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much money they both got together, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money they both got as tips is $1520.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1520}

"Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so that's 2 oranges × 3 daughters = 6 oranges. Her only son got 3 oranges. So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. To find out how many oranges she remained with, we subtract the oranges given away from the total she bought: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges. 

So, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges. The correct answer is 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. So in a year, which has 12 months, Claire earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. So, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns 3 times the number of badges Claire earns in the same time. So, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Paige bakes banana bread from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM. That's 5 hours. In one hour, she can bake 2 loaves of banana bread. So, in 5 hours, she can bake:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices. So, from 10 loaves, she gets:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents. So, the total money she makes is:

So, the total amount Paige raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

We know Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The problem also tells us that she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we let the number of silver coins be \( S \), we can write the equation:
\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find out how many silver coins she has, we need to solve for \( S \). We do this by subtracting 30 from 70:
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

George ordered 600 burritos for the picnic. There were 50 students, and each student got 10 burritos. So, we first calculate how many burritos the students got in total:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos. So, we add the burritos he ate to the ones the students got:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten from the total number of burritos ordered:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

So, the number of leftover burritos is 80. 

The correct answer is: **80**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the rink has 12 red cars. Now, for the green cars, it says there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. So, we calculate the number of green cars as follows:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \]
So, there are 10 green cars.

Next, the number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, we calculate the number of blue cars as:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]
So, there are 30 blue cars.

Now, we add up the red, green, and blue cars:
\[ 12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \]
So, there are 52 cars that are either red, green, or blue.

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find out how many yellow cars there are, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[ 75 - 52 = 23 \]

So, the number of yellow cars is 23.

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that together Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Let's say Anne has \( A \) books. Then Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books, and Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is:
\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Subtract 37 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 48 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Now, to find out how many books Fawn has, we add 12 to the number of books Anne has:
\[ 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{28} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Daisy bought potatoes that weighed 5 pounds. The sweet potatoes weighed twice as much as the potatoes, so the sweet potatoes weighed \(5 \times 2 = 10\) pounds. The carrots weighed 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so the carrots weighed \(10 - 3 = 7\) pounds.

So, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots. The answer is \(\boxed{7}\) pounds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, Greg wants to make jello cups for 30 kids, and each kid should have 4 jello cups. So, we need to find out how many jello cups in total he needs:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we know that one box of jello makes 10 jello cups. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of jello cups by the number of jello cups one box makes:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25. So, to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello. The answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 a month on groceries. Madeline pays 60% of this amount, so we first find out how much Madeline pays:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Keenan pays the rest, which is:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan pays each week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4:

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tobias bought a big pizza with 60 pieces. He ate 2/5 of the pieces on the first day. So, we calculate how many pieces that is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces} \]

After the first day, the number of pieces left is:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces} \]

On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. So, the number of pieces left after the second day is:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces. So, we calculate how many pieces that is:

\[ \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{7 \times 26}{13} = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, to find out how many pieces Tobias has eaten in total, we add the pieces he ate on each day:

\[ 24 \text{ (first day)} + 10 \text{ (second day)} + 14 \text{ (third day)} = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is 48. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for buying soda and water.

First, we need to find out how much one bottle of soda costs. If 7 bottles cost $21.00, then:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of soda} = \frac{21.00}{7} = 3.00 \]
So, one bottle of soda costs $3.00.

Next, we find out how much one bottle of water costs. If 4 bottles cost $8.00, then:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of water} = \frac{8.00}{4} = 2.00 \]
So, one bottle of water costs $2.00.

Now, David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water. Let's calculate the total cost:
- Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 * $3.00 = $9.00
- Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 * $2.00 = $4.00

Adding these together:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00 \]

So, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00.

The final answer is $13.00."

\[ 16 \text{ bolts} \times \$0.03 \text{ per bolt} = \$0.48 \]

David starts with $12.48. After spending $0.48 on the bolts, we need to subtract that from his total money to find out how much he has left.

\[ \$12.48 - \$0.48 = \$12.00 \]

So, David has $12.00 left after buying the bolts. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12.00}

   - There are 10 questions, and she got 80% of them right.
   - So, \( 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \) questions are right.

2. **True/false questions:**
   - There are 20 questions, and she got 90% of them right.
   - So, \( 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \) questions are right.

3. **Long-answer questions:**
   - There are 5 questions, and she got 60% of them right.
   - So, \( 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \) questions are right.

Next, we calculate the points for each type of question:

1. **Multiple-choice questions:**
   - Each question is worth 1 point.
   - So, \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) points.

2. **True/false questions:**
   - Each question is worth 1 point.
   - So, \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) points.

3. **Long-answer questions:**
   - Each question is worth 5 points.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Julie, Micah, and Mitchell sold a total of 32 glasses of lemonade. Julie sold 14 glasses. So, we need to find out how many glasses Micah sold.

First, we subtract the number of glasses Julie sold from the total:
\[ 32 - 14 = 18 \]

This means Micah and Mitchell together sold 18 glasses. Since they sold an equal number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2:
\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

So, Micah sold 9 glasses. Now, we need to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah:
\[ 14 - 9 = 5 \]

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Iris spent at the spa.

First, we know Iris spent $400 on her hair.

Next, she spent 1/4 as much on a manicure. To find out how much that is, we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she spent 3/4 as much on a pedicure as she did on the manicure. To find out how much that is, we calculate:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total amount Iris spent, we add up the cost of her hair, manicure, and pedicure:
\[ 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long and she sells it for $2 per meter. So, she gets:

\[ 20 \text{ meters} \times 2 \text{ dollars/meter} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

With $40, she wants to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide $40 by $1.5 per meter:

\[ \frac{40}{1.5} = 26.\overline{6} \]

Since she can only buy whole meters, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[ 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the money left over after buying the new rope is:

\[ 40 \text{ dollars} - 39 \text{ dollars} = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

Therefore, the money left over is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, to find out her current age, we subtract 10 from 18:
\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]
So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. If her current age is 8, then three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

We need to find out how many years it will take for her age to reach 24. Since she is currently 8, we subtract her current age from 24:
\[ 24 - 8 = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget.

First, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item Kelly has:

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Kelly has \boxed{5} dollars left in her budget."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and it also has a 15-minute encore at the end. So, the total time for the final concert is 65 minutes.

If we let \( x \) be the usual length of her concerts, then the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long. Adding the 15-minute encore, we get:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 15 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of her concerts is 25 minutes.

The answer is: \(\boxed{25}\)"
"Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives some toys to friends:

- 40 toys to Alyssa
- 80 toys to Bonnie
- 30 toys to Nicky

To find out how many toys Argo has left, we need to subtract the total number of toys he gave away from the initial number of toys.

First, let's add up the toys he gave away:
40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys

Now, we subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys:
200 - 150 = 50 toys

So, Argo has 50 toys left. The correct answer is 50."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, so that's \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we add up all the chimichangas:
\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas they make on those three days is 500.

The final answer is \(\boxed{500}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The singer has 50 microphones. He realizes that 20% of them won't fit. First, we need to find out how many microphones that is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit. Now, we subtract these 10 from the total 50 to find out how many microphones can fit:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

These 40 microphones can be paired. To find out how many pairs we can make, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jerry sees 6 birds in the bushes. The number of birds flying overhead is 2/3 of the 6 birds in the bushes. So, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
\]

So, 4 birds are flying overhead.

Next, Jerry sees 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So, we calculate:

\[
3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Now, we add up all the birds Jerry sees:

\[
6 \text{ (in the bushes)} + 4 \text{ (flying overhead)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34.

The final answer is:

\[

"Lani baked 55 cookies and ate 5 of them. So, she had:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, she wants to put these 50 cookies into 5 jars equally. To find out how many cookies go into each jar, we divide 50 by 5:

\[ 50 \div 5 = 10 \]

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar. The number of cookies in each jar is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Joelle has 5 orchids and 4 African daisies. Each orchid has 5 petals, so for 5 orchids, that's:
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Each African daisy has 10 petals, so for 4 daisies, that's:
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the number of petals on the orchids from the number of petals on the daisies:
\[ 40 \text{ petals (daisies)} - 25 \text{ petals (orchids)} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Mrs. Smith has 100 plants in her garden. One-fourth of these plants are indoor plants. So, we calculate the number of indoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of indoor plants} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \]

After removing the indoor plants, we have:

\[ 100 - 25 = 75 \text{ plants left} \]

Two-thirds of these remaining plants are outdoor plants:

\[ \text{Number of outdoor plants} = \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \]

So, the number of flowering plants is:

\[ 75 - 50 = 25 \]

Now, to find out what percent of the plants are flowering plants, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of flowering plants} = \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, the percentage of flowering plants is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find out how fast a whirligig spins, we need to start by figuring out how fast a thingamabob spins. We know that a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, and it spins at 121 meters per second. So, to find the speed of a thingamabob, we divide 121 meters per second by 11:

\[ 121 \div 11 = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now that we know a thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second, we can find out how fast a whirligig spins. We know a whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob. So, we multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5:

\[ 11 \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second. The correct answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Ellen eats:
- 2 carrots
- 1 salad
- 1 yogurt

The salad costs $6.
The yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so it costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, we know the total cost for all these items is $11. So, we can write the equation for the total cost:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Where \( C \) is the cost of one carrot. Simplify the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1.

The final answer is: **$1**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his boss gave him a raise. Now, Mark makes $12 an hour because his boss added $2 to his pay.

Mark works 8 hours a day and he works 5 days a week. So, we need to find out how many hours he works in a week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, to find out how much money Mark makes in a week, we multiply his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Mark makes $480 a week. 

The final answer is: **$480**"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she mowed Joe's lawn 6 times (since Joe paid her $6 for each time). 

Now, let's figure out how much she made from mowing lawns. Since she mowed Joe's lawn 6 times, and she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, that means she mowed Kamala's lawn \(3 \times 6 = 18\) times. And she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times as many times as Joe's, so she mowed Alba's lawn \(5 \times 6 = 30\) times.

So, the total money she made from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \]

Now, to find out how much she made from selling lemonade, we subtract the money she made from mowing lawns from her total earnings:
\[ 80 - 54 = 26 \]

So, Tasha made $26 from selling lemonade. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We know Martin's weight is 55 kg.

1. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight. So, we add 16 kg to Martin's weight:
   \[
   55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg}
   \]
   So, Carl's weight is 71 kg.

2. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight. So, we add 8 kg to Carl's weight:
   \[
   71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg}
   \]
   So, Christian's weight is 79 kg.

3. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight. So, we subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight:
   \[
   79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg}
   \]
   So, Harry's weight is 74 kg.

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

John rents his car 10 times a month, and each time he rents it for 3 hours. So, in one month, he rents his car for:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

He gets $25 for each hour he rents his car. So, his total earnings in one month are:
\[ 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

John's car payment is $500 a month. To find out how much profit he makes, we subtract his car payment from his earnings:
\[ 750 - 500 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John makes a profit of:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Martha originally had some notebooks, and we don't know exactly how many, but we know she bought 5 more notebooks to have a total of 7 notebooks. So, if we subtract the 5 notebooks she bought from the 7 she has now, we can find out how many notebooks she originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks.

Now, Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha originally had. So, we multiply the number of notebooks Martha originally had by 3:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Joseph had 6 notebooks.

Now, we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph. Martha has 7 notebooks and Joseph has 6 notebooks, so we subtract:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

So, the answer is that Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The correct choice is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On Sunday, Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we need to add 1/5 of 50 miles to 50 miles.

First, let's find out what 1/5 of 50 is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

So, Anis rowed:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance they both rowed, we add Dijana's and Anis's distances together:
\[ 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles} \]

So, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is 110 miles. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"

Susan made 100 cookies and wanted to share them equally among her 6 nephews. But before she could do that, her husband took 4 cookies for himself. So, we need to find out how many cookies each nephew gets after the husband took some.

First, we subtract the 4 cookies the husband took from the 100 cookies:
\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Now, we need to divide the 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews:
\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each nephew gets 16 cookies. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

Denise and Daniel are reading the same book. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.

Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel did yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

Now, let's add up how many pages each of them read in total:
- Denise read 10 pages yesterday and 18 pages today, so in total she read \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.
- Daniel read 13 pages yesterday and 0 pages today, so in total he read \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read:
\[28 - 13 = 15\]

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The answer is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Calvin is making soup for his family. The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. Calvin is an adult, so he can fill the pot with 4 adult bowls. His wife is also an adult, and they have two children.

1. **Total bowls needed**: Calvin (1 adult) + Calvin's wife (1 adult) + 2 children (2 children) = 4 bowls in total.
2. **Bowls available**: The pot can fill 4 adult bowls, which is the same as 8 child's bowls.
3. **Bowls used**: Since they need 4 bowls and the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, all 4 bowls are used up.
4. **Bowls left**: Since all 4 bowls are used, there are no bowls left over.

So, since there are no bowls left over, each child can't have another bowl of soup. The answer is that each child can have a bowl of soup **0 times**.

"To find out how much material Jo needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how much material is needed for one small mask and one large mask.

1. **Material for one small mask:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - So, for one small mask, she needs:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
     \]

2. **Material for one large mask:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - So, for one large mask, she needs:
     \[
     \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
     \]

Now, let's calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

3. **Total material for 20 small masks:**
   - Material per small mask: 0.5 yards
   - Total material for 20 small masks:
     \[
     20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

4. **Total material for 8 large masks:**
   - Material per large mask: 0.75 yards
   - Total material for 8 large masks:
     \[
     8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

Finally, we add the material needed for both types of masks to find the total material required.

5. **Total material needed:**
   \[
   10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so that's 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up all the time he spends on these activities:
- Sleeping: 10 hours
- Working: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

So, 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day. To find out how much free time Harold has, we subtract the time he spends on activities from the total hours in a day:
24 - 19 = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day. The answer is 5 hours."

Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

First, Tim uses 3 blue shoe boxes. So, he has:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ blue shoe boxes left} \]

Next, Tim uses one-third of his red shoe boxes. One-third of 9 red shoe boxes is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ red shoe boxes used} \]

So, he has:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \text{ red shoe boxes left} \]

Now, we add the blue and red shoe boxes left together:

We know Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

We are told that eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, four years ago, Adam's age was:
\[ \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

Since four years ago Adam was 26, his current age is:
\[ 26 + 4 = 30 \]

Now, to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm. So, we first find out how big Farmer Smith's farm is.

Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is:
\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Now, we add 100 acres to this amount to get Farmer Smith's farm:
\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

So, Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres and Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres. To find out how many acres both farms have together, we add these two numbers:
\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is 700 acres. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. So, we first find out how many packages he completes per hour:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Now, we need to find out how many packages he completes in an eight-hour workday. We multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours in a workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes. To find out how much he earns in total for the eight-hour workday, we multiply the total number of packages by the amount he earns per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday. The final answer is:

John drinks one bottle of water every half hour. A normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can find out how many half-hours are in 45 minutes:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes/half-hour} = 1.5 \text{ half-hours} \]

So, for a normal Sudoku puzzle, John drinks 1.5 bottles of water.

Now, an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal one. So, we calculate the time for an extreme Sudoku:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many half-hours are in 180 minutes:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 30 \text{ minutes/half-hour} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Therefore, for an extreme Sudoku, John drinks 6 bottles of water.

The number of bottles of water John drinks in that time is \(\boxed{6}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. We know there are 20 red balloons.

First, we calculate how many pieces of bologna were used for the red balloons:
\[ 20 \text{ red balloons} \times 2 \text{ pieces per red balloon} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we know that Benny used 58 pieces in total, so the rest must have been used for the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red balloons} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow balloons} \]

Since each yellow balloon gets 3 pieces of bologna, we can find out how many yellow balloons there are by dividing the pieces used for yellow balloons by 3:
\[ 18 \text{ pieces} \div 3 \text{ pieces per yellow balloon} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jon drives 100 miles every day. If he drives for 30 days, we can find out the total distance he drives in a month by multiplying the miles he drives each day by the number of days in a month:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Now, Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many times he needs a tune-up, we divide the total miles he drives by 1000 miles:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Sure, let's figure this out step by step.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he worked on Tuesday, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than what he worked on Wednesday, so that's \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, to find out how many hours he worked in total over these three days, we add up the hours:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

So, Bruce worked a total of 23 hours over these three days. The final answer is 23 hours."
"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to add up all the money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's look at the costs:
- The cake costs $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, each balloon costs $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. So, 12 balloons cost 12 * $0.25 = $3.
- They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7. So, 2 tubs cost 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
\[ \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[ \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. That's a total of 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit. Lola ate 2 pieces, so we need to subtract those from the total. 

So, 14 - 2 = 12 pieces of fruit are left.

The number of pieces left is 12."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 6 students playing tennis.
2. For volleyball, it says there are twice as many students as playing tennis. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ students}
   \]
3. Now, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball:
   \[
   6 + 12 = 18 \text{ students}
   \]
4. Next, we look at the soccer players. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so:
   \[
   16 + 22 = 38 \text{ students}
   \]
5. To find the total number of students, we add the students from tennis, volleyball, and soccer:
   \[
   18 + 38 = 56 \text{ students}
   \]

So, the total number of students is 56. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops were sold in total. There are 30 students, and each student sold 10 lollipops. So, we multiply the number of students by the number of lollipops each student sold:
\[ 30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we need to find out how much money was made from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8. So, we multiply the total number of lollipops by the price per lollypop:
\[ 300 \times 0.8 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much money was spent to buy the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5. So, we multiply the total number of lollipops by the price per lollypop:
\[ 300 \times 0.5 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money the class raised, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the money made from selling them:
\[ 240 - 150 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

So, the total number of pets is \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\).

Therefore, the total number of pets Larry has is 47."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

A loaf of bread has 24 slices. Abby can eat 2 slices a day, and Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat:
\[ 2 \text{ slices (Abby)} + 4 \text{ slices (Josh)} = 6 \text{ slices per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days the loaf of bread will last. The loaf has 24 slices, and they eat 6 slices per day. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices they eat together each day:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices per day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days. The answer is 4."
"Martha starts collecting shells when she is 5 years old and she collects one shell every month. By the time she is 10 years old, we need to find out how many months that is.

From age 5 to age 10, that's 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 5 years by 12 months:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ months} \]

So, Martha has been collecting shells for 60 months. Since she collects one shell each month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is:

\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

The final answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She uses 15 of these cups to make cinnamon tea. So, the remaining cups are:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
These 12 cups are split equally between chamomile and mint tea. So, she makes:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea.

Now, she divides these 27 cups into 3 rows equally. So, each row has:
\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]
cups of tea.

Since the 6 cups of mint tea are split equally between the 3 rows, each row has:
\[ \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]
cups of mint tea.

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step in a simpler way.

The sloth takes 4 hours to go down to the ground and pick berries, then climb back up. We need to find out how many trips he can make in 8 hours.

First, we calculate how many trips he can make in 8 hours:
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Now, we know he wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he makes 2 trips in 8 hours, we divide the total berries by the number of trips to find out how many berries he picks up per trip:
\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

So, the least number of berries he can pick up per trip is 12 berries. 

The answer is: **12 berries/trip**"
"To solve this problem, we start by figuring out how much water is in the tank. The pool has 10000 gallons of water, and the tank gets half of that amount. So, the tank gets:

\[ \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to know how much water is left in the tank after 6 days. The tank loses 500 gallons of water each day. So, in 6 days, it loses:

\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we subtract the amount of water lost from the initial amount in the tank:

\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, after 6 days, the tank will have 2000 gallons of water left. The final answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Colby has $150 to spend on movies. He wants to buy a popcorn ($8) and a box of candy ($2) first. So, he spends $8 + $2 = $10 on these items.

Now, his remaining money is $150 - $10 = $140. He can only see movies on Fridays or Saturdays for $10 each, and on other days for $7 each.

Colby has already seen 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays and 8 movies on other days. That's a total of 5 + 8 = 13 movies. Since it's the last day of the month and it's a Friday, he can only see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday, which costs $10.

So, the number of additional movies he can see is 1.

The final answer is: **1**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has one-third of that, so:

\[ \text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has one-third of that, so:

\[ \text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls. Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, so:

\[ \text{Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins. Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, so:

\[ \text{Total calories from mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \times 150 = 45000 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we add the total calories from both types of pastries:

\[ \text{Total calories} = 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \text{ calories} \]

So, the total number of calories in all the pastries Andrew baked is 85000 calories. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{85000} \]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita picks per day, we first need to add up all the Junebugs she picked over the week.

On Monday, she picked 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she picked twice as many as Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also picked twice as many as Monday, so that's another 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she picked 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she picked 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Adding them step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, Rita picked a total of 299 Junebugs over the week.

To find the average number of Junebugs she picked per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days (which is 5):
\[299 \div 5 = 59.8\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita picks per day is 59.8.

The final answer is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the bus and the car.

First, we calculate how far the bus traveled. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how far the car traveled. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sophie had some toys before she bought the bouncy balls. She had 31 building blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 stacking rings. So, the total number of toys she had before was:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Now, Sophie has 62 toys in total. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we need to subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, Sophie bought 14 bouncy balls.

The number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

First, let's say Jean's age is \( J \). Then Paul's age is \( J + 10 \) because Paul is 10 years older than Jean.

Peter's age is the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages, so Peter's age is \( J + (J + 10) = 2J + 10 \).

Now, we know the total age is 100, so we can write the equation:
\[ J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100 \]

Simplify the left side:
\[ J + J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]

Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

So Jean is 20 years old. Now we can find Paul's age:
\[ J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

And Peter's age:
\[ 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

So Peter is 50 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

First, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, that's:
\[ 4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons per friend} = 8 \text{ balloons} \]

Maria also got 1 water balloon, so now we have:
\[ 8 \text{ balloons} + 1 \text{ balloon} = 9 \text{ balloons} \]

Then, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons per person} = 15 \text{ balloons} \]

Now, we add the balloons from before and the new ones:
\[ 9 \text{ balloons} + 15 \text{ balloons} = 24 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is:
\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total. There are 10 people who each donate 5 boxes, so that's:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

They also have 10 boxes already. So, the total number of boxes is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff. To find out how many tables they need, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes each table can hold:
\[ 60 \div 2 = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

So, they need 15 new tables. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Zoey and Sydney.

Zoey has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Sydney has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we add the total distances they both spat:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet} = 820 \text{ feet} \]

To find the average total distance, we divide the total distance by 2:
\[ \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{410}

"To figure out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many widgets each machine can make in a day and then in a month.

- The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour. If it runs 24 hours a day, it makes:
  \[
  60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}
  \]
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour. If it runs 24 hours a day, it makes:
  \[
  45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}
  \]

Next, we calculate how many widgets each machine makes in a month (30 days):
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes:
  \[
  1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}
  \]
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes:
  \[
  1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}
  \]

Now, we calculate the money each machine makes by selling the widgets. Each widget sells for $6:
- The Widgeteer 3000 makes:
  \[
  43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200
  \]
- The WidgetMaster 9000 makes:
  \[
  32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400
  \]

Finally, we find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[
\$259200 - \$194400 = \$64800
\]

So, Fern will make \$64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{64800}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Cameron's stay at the hotel.

1. **24-hour option**: This costs 1600 pesos.
2. **12-hour plus additional hours option**:
   - The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
   - After 12 hours, Cameron stays for 5 more hours. Each extra hour costs 70 pesos, so 5 extra hours cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
   - So, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, to find out how much Cameron would save, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option from the cost of the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

So, Cameron would save **250 pesos**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat gets 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate it like this:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we know there are 15 goats and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. So, the total hay for the goats is:

\[
15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know there are 12 sheep and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay. So, the total hay for the sheep is:

\[
12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find out the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the hay for the goats and the hay for the sheep:

\[
75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{159}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

John earns $50 per hour and works 6 hours. So, his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $50 on gas, he has:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

He wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so he has:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he buys 5 pencils that cost $10 each. The total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, he has:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Each pen costs $25, so the number of pens he can buy with $100 is:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the number of pens John can buy is 4. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Craig spelled out 20 words, and each word had 15 letters. So, we multiply 20 by 15 to find out how many letters Craig spelled out:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]
So, Craig spelled out 300 letters.

Now, Craig's brother spelled out words that had 50 more letters than Craig. So, we add 50 to the 300 letters Craig spelled out:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]
So, Craig's brother spelled out 350 letters.

To find the total number of letters they both spelled out, we add Craig's letters to his brother's letters:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters they spelled out after ten rounds is 650. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To find out how many children can be in the drill, we need to calculate the total number of children based on the given information.

First, let's break it down:
- There are 8 children in each row.
- There are 7 rows for each school.
- There are 5 different schools.

So, we need to find out how many children are in one school first:
- Number of children in one school = Number of children in one row × Number of rows for one school
- Number of children in one school = 8 children/row × 7 rows
- Number of children in one school = 56 children

Now, we need to find out the total number of children for all the schools:
- Total number of children = Number of children in one school × Number of schools
- Total number of children = 56 children/school × 5 schools
- Total number of children = 280 children

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be used to get 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the teacher can get:

"To find out how much Patty charged, we need to add up all the costs for the job.

First, we have a fixed visit fee of $40.

Next, we calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, and the cost is $35 per hour. So, we multiply 2.25 by 35:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Then, we add the cost of parts, which is $60.

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged $178.75. The correct answer is:

James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost before any discount is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

But he gets them for 40% off. To find out how much he pays after the discount, we calculate 40% of $150 and subtract it from $150:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 150 = 0.40 \times 150 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

So, James pays $90 for the 10 CDs.

James decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for $40. The cost of these 5 CDs is:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

When he sells them for $40, he loses:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money James was out is:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Jen has different types of root crops and she wants to know how much money she can make if she sells all of them. We need to calculate the earnings from each type of crop and then add them all together.

1. **Yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam is sold for $1.5.
   - So, the total money from yams = 6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9.

2. **Sweet Potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato is sold for $2.
   - So, the total money from sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20.

3. **Carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot is sold for $1.25.
   - So, the total money from carrots = 4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5.

Now, we add up all the money she can make from selling all the root crops:
- Total money = Money from yams + Money from sweet potatoes + Money from carrots
- Total money = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34.

So, if Jen sells all her root crops, she will earn $34. The correct answer is $34."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

James has to swim across a 20-mile lake. He swims at a speed of 2 miles per hour. He swims 60% of the distance, which is:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to swim 12 miles. Since he swims at 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming 12 miles, he rests for half as long as the time he spent swimming. So, the rest time is:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he has to swim the remaining distance, which is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since he swims at half the speed after resting, his new speed is:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \]

So, the time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the times:
\[ 6 \text{ hours (swimming)} + 3 \text{ hours (resting)} + 8 \text{ hours (swimming)} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had. So, we need to calculate seven times 70 and then subtract 40 from that number.

First, calculate seven times 70:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Now, subtract 40 from 490:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread. The final answer is:

\[ 450 \]"
"Jasmine started with 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers, so she had:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers, so she had:

\[ 8 + 5 = 13 \]

So, at the end, Jasmine has 13 stickers. The answer is 13."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Cayley gets money for selling newspapers. He gets 10 cents for each New York Times and 8 cents for each Wall Street Journal. He sells 6 New York Times and 10 Wall Street Journals.

First, let's find out how much money he gets from the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5 and he gets 10 cents (or $0.10) for each one.
- So, for 6 New York Times, he gets 6 * $0.10 = $0.60.

Next, let's find out how much money he gets from the Wall Street Journals:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15 and he gets 8 cents (or $0.08) for each one.
- So, for 10 Wall Street Journals, he gets 10 * $0.08 = $0.80.

Now, let's add the money he gets from both:
- Total money = Money from New York Times + Money from Wall Street Journals = $0.60 + $0.80 = $1.40.

So, Cayley will earn a total of $1.40 from selling 6 New York Times and 10 Wall Street Journals.

The final answer is $1.40."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so if Marcus is 21, then Leo must be \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.

So, Leo is 42 years old. The correct answer is 42."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar. So, if we let the points Azibo scored be \( A \), then Bahati scored \( A + 20 \) points, and Dinar scored \( A + 10 \) points.

The total points scored by all three is 45. So we can write the equation:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Now, let's simplify this equation:
\[ A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Next, we need to solve for \( A \):
\[ 3A + 30 - 30 = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many pages are in the book, we need to think about the thickness of the book and how many pages fit into that thickness.

We know that:
- 1 inch of paper has 100 pages.
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.

So, if 1 inch has 100 pages, then 1.5 inches will have:
\[ 1.5 \times 100 = 150 \text{ pages} \]

Each page is printed on both sides, but that doesn't change the total number of pages in the book. It just means that the book has 150 pages in total.

So, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[ \boxed{150} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Vince starts stapling reports at 8:00 AM and stops at 11:00 PM. That's a total of 16 hours. We need to convert those hours into minutes because Vince can staple reports in 15-minute intervals.

16 hours is the same as 16 * 60 = 960 minutes.
Now, Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 960 minutes, we divide 960 by 15:
960 ÷ 15 = 64 intervals.

Since Vince staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by 30:
64 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1920 reports.

So, Vince stapled a total of 1920 reports. The answer is 1920."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting hours to minutes, that's 480 minutes.

One day, she sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. That's 23 minutes of sleepwalking.

She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So, she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m.

Now, let's see how much time she was awake that day. From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, it's 475 minutes.

She spent 23 minutes sleepwalking and 5 minutes waking up early, which totals 28 minutes not sleeping.

So, the actual time she slept is 480 minutes (total sleep time) minus 28 minutes (time not sleeping), which is 452 minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{452}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups. Since one dozen is 12, two dozen is:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]
So, Jonathan has 24 measuring cups.

Now, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, the number of measuring spoons he has is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \]
So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

He gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, so he has:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]
measuring spoons left.

Now, we add the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons to find the total number of utensils:
\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The hospital has 1000 beds in total.
2. At first, 1/5 of the beds are occupied. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds are occupied.}
   \]
3. This means the number of unoccupied beds at first is:
   \[
   1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds are unoccupied.}
   \]
4. Now, 50 new patients are admitted each day. Over 2 weeks (which is 14 days), the number of new patients admitted is:
   \[
   50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients.
   }
5. So, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is:
   \[
   200 \text{ (initially occupied) } + 700 \text{ (new patients) } = 900 \text{ beds are occupied.}
   \]
6. Therefore, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:
   \[
   1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ beds.
   }

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the rest are:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]
emails that are not work emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]
emails.

Now, we subtract the emails sent to her family from the total non-work emails:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]
emails left.

One-third of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]
email.

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Aliya is 3 years old.
2. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old}

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old. 

The final answer is: 45"
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert, but Kelly said Courtney might have counted too many by 20%. To find out the real number of people, we need to figure out what 20% of 48 is and then subtract that from 48.

First, let's find 20% of 48:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = \frac{20}{100} \times 48 = 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

So, if Courtney counted 9.6 more people than there actually were, we subtract that from 48 to find the real number of people:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a person at a concert, we round this to the nearest whole number. The closest whole number to 38.4 is 38.

So, the real number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know that Jason carried 2 balls. According to the problem, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried half as many balls as Jason. Since Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey carried \(2 \div 2 = 1\) ball.

So, the total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[1 \text{ (Jeffrey)} + 2 \text{ (Jason)} + 4 \text{ (Jordan)} = 7 \text{ balls}\]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
On the third day, they dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net increase was 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

So, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes they had dug is:
10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 6 (net third day) = 29 holes.

By the end of the third day, the island had 4 times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since they had 10 holes at the end of the first day, the island had 4 * 10 = 40 holes by the end of the third day.

So, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is:
40 (total by end of third day) - 29 (total by end of third day) = 11 holes.

Therefore, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is \boxed{11}."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. That's 70 + 70 = 140 corn chips for them together.

Collins got 15 more corn chips than Amora or Lainey. So, Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, to find the total number of corn chips, we add the chips that Amora, Lainey, and Collins got:
140 (Amora and Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225 corn chips.

So, the total number of corn chips is 225."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Jen needs to pay $400 for supplies. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. To find out how much the tickets cost, we first need to calculate 50% of $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Adding that to the cost of the supplies:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the travel cost is $600.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how many Pokemon Stan has caught.

We know that:
1. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan.
2. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.
3. Together they have caught 339 Pokemon.

Let's use \( A \) for the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught, \( S \) for the number of Pokemon Stan has caught, and \( X \) for the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.

From the information given:
- \( X = S + 5 \)
- \( S = 4A - 13 \)
- \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, we substitute \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the total equation:

\[ (S + 5) + S + A = 339 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2S + A + 5 = 339 \]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[ 2S + A = 334 \]

Now, we substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[ 2(4A - 13) + A = 334 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 8A - 26 + A = 334 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 9A - 26 = 334 \]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:

\[ A = 40 \]

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find out how many Stan has caught:

\[ S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The number of Pokemon Stan has caught is \(\boxed{147}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know each episode is 20 minutes long. The problem says there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, if each episode is 20 minutes, then the number of episodes is half of 20, which is 10 episodes.

Now, if each episode is 20 minutes and there are 10 episodes, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
\[ 10 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To find the total distance the bird flew, we need to add up the distances of each part of her journey.

1. The bird flew for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. So, the distance for this part is:
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ miles/hour} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Then, the bird flew for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. So, the distance for this part is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 18 \text{ miles/hour} = 36 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. Finally, the bird flew for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. So, the distance for this part is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours} \times 22 \text{ miles/hour} = 110 \text{ miles}
   \]

Now, we add up all these distances to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{446}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Greta made 1 dozen brownies for herself. That's 12 brownies.

At her office party, she got 1/2 dozen brownies. Since 1 dozen is 12, half of that is 6 brownies.

When her friends threw her a surprise party, they gave her 4 dozen brownies. That's 4 times 12, which equals 48 brownies.

So, in total, she had:
\[ 12 \text{ (her batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies} \]

During the party, they ate 1 1/2 dozen brownies. Half a dozen is 6, so 1 1/2 dozen is 1.5 times 12, which is 18 brownies.

Now, we subtract the brownies eaten from the total:
\[ 66 \text{ (total)} - 18 \text{ (eaten)} = 48 \text{ brownies} \]

So, the number of brownies Greta had left over is 48. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{48}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is:
\[ 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is:
\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find the total age of all three family members, we add their ages together:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

So, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of racquet and then add them up.

First, let's calculate the time for the synthetic gut racquets:
- Andy has 3 racquets that need synthetic gut.
- It takes him 15 minutes to string each racquet.
- So, the total time for synthetic gut is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the polyester string racquets:
- Andy has 5 racquets that need polyester string.
- It takes him 22 minutes to string each racquet.
- So, the total time for polyester string is \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes.

Finally, let's calculate the time for the hybrid sets:
- Andy has 4 racquets that need a hybrid set.
- It takes him 18 minutes to string each racquet.
- So, the total time for hybrid sets is \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Total time = time for synthetic gut + time for polyester string + time for hybrid sets
- Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes
- Total time = 227 minutes

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets. The correct answer is 227 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John wants to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. That makes a total of 4 phones.

The first two phones cost $600 each.
So, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 600 + 600 = 1200 \]

The next two phones are half price. So, each of these phones costs:
\[ 600 / 2 = 300 \]

The cost for the next two phones is:
\[ 300 + 300 = 600 \]

Now, we add up the cost of all four phones:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for the phones is $1800.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1800}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know that Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, we add 7 to 13 to find out how many players are on Zeke's team:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Now, to find out the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players on Carlton's team to the number of players on Zeke's team:

\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

So, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33.

The final answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we first need to calculate the total length of the fence. The fence is a rectangle that is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all its sides, which is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. So, we have:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Now, Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the total length of the fence by 2 to find out how many slats he needs:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister. So, she gave away a total of 4 boxes.

Now, she kept 1/4 of the oranges. Since she had 12 boxes, 1/4 of 12 is 3 boxes. So, she kept 3 boxes.

This means she sold the rest of the boxes. The rest is 12 - 3 = 9 boxes.

Each box has 20 oranges, so the total number of oranges she sold is 9 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 180 oranges.

So, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is 180.

The final answer is: **180**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Let's say the USA has \( S \) states. So, half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{S}{2} \). India has 4 more than that, so India has \( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \) states.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA and India together:
\[ S + \left( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \right) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ S + \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]
\[ = \frac{2S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]
\[ = \frac{3S}{2} + 4 \]

Now, we need to know the number of states in the USA to find the exact total. But since the problem doesn't give us the exact number of states in the USA, we can't get a specific number. However, if we assume the USA has 50 states (which is a common number), then:
\[ S = 50 \]

So, we substitute \( S = 50 \) into our equation:
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 \]
\[ = \frac{150}{2} + 4 \]
\[ = 75 + 4 \]
\[ = 79 \]

Therefore, if the USA has 50 states, the total number of states in both countries together is 79.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"Tyler wants to buy a dictionary that costs $18, a dinosaur book that costs $13, and a children's cookbook that costs $8. He has saved $14 from his allowance. He earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to afford his books, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books.

The total cost is:
$18 (dictionary) + $13 (dinosaur book) + $8 (children's cookbook) = $39

Tyler has already saved $14, so the additional amount he needs is:
$39 - $14 = $25

Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, the number of hours he needs to work to earn $25 is:
$25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

Richard, Jerry, and Robert are sharing 60 cherries. Robert has 30 cherries, which is 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 20 cherries.

Now, to find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:
\[ 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \]
So, Jerry has 10 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number Robert has:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Sunny sold gingerbread and apple pie over two days. Here's what we know:

- On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. So, on Sunday, he sold 10 + 4 = 14 boxes of apple pie.
- On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- On Sunday, he also sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's add up how many boxes he sold each day:
- On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 14 boxes of apple pie.
- On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.

Next, we calculate the total number of boxes sold:
- Total gingerbread sold: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie sold: 14 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 29 boxes

Now, we calculate the money he made from each type of pie:
- Each box of gingerbread costs $6, so he made 25 boxes * $6 = $150 from gingerbread.
- Each box of apple pie costs $15, so he made 29 boxes * $15 = $435 from apple pie.

Finally, we add the money he made from both types of pies:
- Total money made: $150 (gingerbread) + $435 (apple pie) = $585

So, Sunny earned $585 over the two days. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{585}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Pamela spends 4 hours outside each day. If she goes on vacation for 8 days, we need to find out how many hours she will be outside in total.

\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen for each hour she's outside. So, for 32 hours, she will need:

\[ 32 \text{ ounces of sunscreen} \]

Her sunscreen comes in bottles that each contain 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces of sunscreen by the ounces each bottle contains:

\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, so we need to find out what 40% of $100 is.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40 \]

So, the red car costs $40 less than the blue car. To find the price of the red car, we subtract $40 from the price of the blue car.

\[ \text{Price of the red car} = \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car.

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$100 + \$60 = \$160 \]

So, the total cost of both cars is $160. 

The correct answer is: **$160**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Emil is 19 years old now. When he turns 24, that means 5 years from now.

1. When Emil is 24, his dad will be twice his age, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
2. Also, when Emil is 24, he will be half his dad's age, so his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.
3. This means in 5 years, Emil's dad will be 48 years old. So, Emil's dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
4. When Emil is 24, his brother will be half his age, so his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old.
5. This means in 5 years, Emil's brother will be 12 years old. So, Emil's brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Now, to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now:
43 (dad's age) + 7 (brother's age) = 50

So, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 50. The correct answer is 50."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads. Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads. Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so that's 2 × 20 = 40 beads.

Now, to find out how many beads Adrianne has in total, we add all these beads together:
20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = 90 beads.

So, Adrianne has 90 beads altogether. The correct answer is 90."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times what he caught on Thursday, so:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half of what he caught on Friday, so:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up all the crawfish he caught:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Each serving of crawfish is 3 pounds. To find out how many servings he has, we divide the total pounds by the pounds per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, the number of servings Joe has is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

First, we need to find out how many students are football players. We know that 20% of the 30 students are football players. So, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players.

Next, we need to find out how many students are not football players. We subtract the number of football players from the total number of students:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band. So, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are cheerleaders or part of the band.

Now, we add the number of football players and the number of cheerleaders or band members to find out how many students are leaving early:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is 12."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Sophie's boots are size 5. Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, so:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]
So, Charlie's boots are size 25.

Now, to find the average size of the boots they both wear, we add their sizes together and then divide by 2:
\[ \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of the boots they both wear is 15.

The final answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long. Each flower plant is 1 foot wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Pat already has 17 plants.

First, we need to figure out how many plants Pat needs in total to fill the bed. If we have \( n \) plants, the total space they will take up is:
\[ n \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ foot/plant} + (n-1) \text{ spaces} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/space} = 111 \text{ feet} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ n + 1.5(n-1) = 111 \]
\[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n = 112.5 \]
\[ n = \frac{112.5}{2.5} \]
\[ n = 45 \]

So, Pat needs 45 plants in total. Since she already has 17 plants, she needs to buy:
\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost is:
\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $168 at the store.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar. So, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

First, we find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in one day:
- Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day.
- Edgar's brother eats half as many, so he eats \(18 \div 2 = 9\) pretzels a day.

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in one day by 7:
- Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day.
- In a week, he eats \(9 \times 7 = 63\) pretzels.

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week. The answer is 63."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Katherine has 5 hanging baskets, and in each basket, she wants to put 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.

First, let's find out how much it costs to fill one basket:
- Each petunia costs $3.00, and she wants 3 petunias, so:
  \[
  3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 \text{ per petunia} = \$9.00
  \]
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50, and she wants 2 vines, so:
  \[
  2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 \text{ per vine} = \$5.00
  \]

Now, let's add the cost of the petunias and the sweet potato vines to find out how much one basket costs:
\[
\$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00
\]

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by 5:
\[
5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 \text{ per basket} = \$70.00
\]

So, Katherine will spend \$70.00 to fill all 5 hanging baskets. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Artemis and her father have a 30-pound bag of soil. They use some of it for sunflowers and carnations first.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, they use:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, they use:
\[ 10 \times 1.5 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with 30 pounds of soil. After using 27 pounds, they have:
\[ 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, they can plant:
\[ 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, the number of roses they can plant is 3. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month. She puts aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we first need to calculate how much she saves each month for shoes.

She saves 25% of $2,000.00 each month, so:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

So, she saves $500 each month for shoes. In a year, which has 12 months, she saves:

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so the number of pairs of shoes she can buy in a year is:

\[ \frac{6000}{1000} = 6 \]

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The answer is 6."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute, so we divide 90 by 6:

\[ 90 \div 6 = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes her 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp. The problem tells us that she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To sauté 90 shrimp, we need to do a bit of math:

\[ \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp}} \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes her 30 minutes to sauté 90 shrimp.

Now, we add the time it takes to peel and the time it takes to sauté:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take her 45 minutes to peel and sauté 90 shrimp. The answer is 45 minutes."
"Okay, let's go through this step by step again, but in a simpler way.

Imagine you have a room that starts at a certain temperature. We want to know how much cooler it is after the air conditioner has been on for a while.

1. The air conditioner is on low for 3 hours. It cools the room by 2 degrees each hour. So, in 3 hours, it will cool the room by:
   \[
   2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}
   \]

2. Then, the air conditioner is turned to high for 4 hours. It cools the room by 3 degrees each hour. So, in 4 hours, it will cool the room by:
   \[
   3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. After that, the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours. The room warms up by 2 degrees each hour. So, in 2 hours, the room will warm up by:
   \[
   2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the cooling and warming:
- Cooling from low setting: 6 degrees
- Cooling from high setting: 12 degrees
- Warming up: 4 degrees

So, the net change in temperature is:
\[
6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees}
\]

This means the room is 14 degrees cooler than it was at the start. So, the final temperature is 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
2. The comet comes around every 75 years, so 75 years later, Bill's dad saw it again.
3. Bill saw it the second time when he was three times the age his dad was when he first saw it. So, three times 30 is 90. This means Bill was 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.
4. Since the comet comes around every 75 years, Bill must have seen it the first time 75 years before he saw it the second time. So, if he was 90 when he saw it the second time, he must have been 90 - 75 = 15 years old when he saw it the first time.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the comet for the first time. The answer is 15."
"Buford writes a check for his electric bill once a month, so that's 12 checks a year. He also writes a check for his gas bill once a month, so that's another 12 checks a year. He writes a check to the church twice a month, so that's 24 checks a year. And he writes a check to the pest and lawn service once every 3 months, so that's 4 checks a year. 

To find out how many checks he writes in total, we add all these up:

12 (electric bill) + 12 (gas bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52 checks a year.

So, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is 52. 

The correct answer is: **52**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. So, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane. That means the first plane makes:

\[ 44 \times 2 = 88 \text{ trips in a day} \]

Now, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights. So, the number of trips to Greece is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \text{ trips} \]

The remaining trips are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Since the total number of trips is 88, the number of trips to France is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \text{ trips} \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have three wolves: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous.

1. Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
2. Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. So, Chikote howls for \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
3. Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined. So, Igneous howls for \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Now, let's add up the total time they howl:
- Tobias: 20 seconds
- Chikote: 40 seconds
- Igneous: 60 seconds

Total time = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 120 seconds to minutes:
- 120 seconds ÷ 60 = 2 minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.

The final answer is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Adam bought trousers for $30. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice as much as his mother. So, his father gave him $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, let's add the money his mother and father gave him together:
$6 (mother) + $12 (father) = $18.

Adam spent $30 on the trousers, but he only had $18 from his parents. So, the money he had to contribute from his savings is:
$30 (cost of trousers) - $18 (money from parents) = $12.

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The answer is:
\[ 12 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know the total age of the four children is 20 years. We also know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. So, let's add their ages together:

\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

This means the total age of Helene and Wilfred together is:

\[ 20 - 7 = 13 \]

Now, we're told that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. First, let's find the average age of the group:

\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age, her age is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Now we know Helene is 10 years old. We already found out that the total age of Helene and Wilfred is 13. So, to find Wilfred's age, we subtract Helene's age from 13:

\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred is 3 years old. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{3}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from his online fund. So, the total he has so far is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, Walter's friend gives him $200. So, the total amount collected now is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. So, the lawyer will donate:
\[ 3 \times 2200 = 6600 \]

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6600}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. There were 100 guests at the wedding, and each guest brought 15 cookies.
2. So, the total number of cookies is \(100 \times 15 = 1500\) cookies.
3. The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door, so \(1500 \div 2 = 750\) cookies were given to the church.
4. Each person in the church got 15 cookies.
5. To find out how many people got cookies, we divide the total cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person got: \(750 \div 15 = 50\).

So, the number of people in the church next door is 50. The answer is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We have a watermelon that needs to be divided among 2 adults and 4 kids. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's say each kid gets a slice of size \( x \). Then, each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \).

Now, we need to find out what fraction of the watermelon each adult gets.

There are 4 kids, so the total size of the slices for the kids is:
\[ 4x \]

There are 2 adults, so the total size of the slices for the adults is:
\[ 2 \times 2x = 4x \]

The total size of the watermelon is the sum of the slices for the kids and the adults:
\[ 4x + 4x = 8x \]

Each adult's slice is \( 4x \), and the total watermelon is \( 8x \). To find out what fraction of the watermelon each adult gets, we divide the size of each adult's slice by the total size of the watermelon:
\[ \frac{4x}{8x} = \frac{1}{2} \]

To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, each adult gets 50% of the watermelon.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"

"To figure out when Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make and serve the cake.

First, let's add up all the time:
- Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.
- Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
- Cooling the cake takes 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
- Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.

Now, let's add these times together:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is the same as 3 hours, we need to subtract 3 hours from the time the cake needs to be ready, which is 5:00 pm.

So, 5:00 pm minus 3 hours is:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake is:
\[ 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{2:00 pm} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars.

First, we need to find out how many boxes they sold in total:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

They sold 64 chocolate bars in total, and these 8 boxes contain 64 chocolate bars. To find out how many chocolate bars are in one box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in one box.

The number of chocolate bars in a box is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much the dance studio earns in a month.

1. **Cost to rent the studio per session**: $25
2. **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
3. **Number of students**: 10
4. **Total cost per session for students**: \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars
5. **Total cost per session for the studio and students**: \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars
6. **Sessions per week**: 3
7. **Sessions per month**: 3 weeks per month, so \(3 \times 4 = 12\) sessions

Now, to find out the total earnings in a month:
- Total cost per session: $40
- Total sessions in a month: 12
- Total earnings in a month: \(40 \times 12 = 480\) dollars

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and the total is 64. So, to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide 64 by 4:
\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \]
So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and the total is 56. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes, we divide 56 by 7:
\[ 56 \div 7 = 8 \]
So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number in each of Peter's boxes:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We know there are 50 porcupines in the park.
2. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]
   So, there are 30 female porcupines.
3. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the number of babies born each month is:
   \[
   30 \times 4 = 120
   \]
4. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:
   \[
   120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]
5. Now, we add the babies born in a year to the original number of porcupines:
   \[
   50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much water the pool can hold in cubic feet. The pool is shaped like a big box, so we use the formula for the volume of a box:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth} \]

The pool is 25 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 4 feet deep. So we calculate:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 56 \]

\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company told us to multiply the volume by 5.9:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]

\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it will cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon, so we multiply the number of gallons by 0.10:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]

\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know there are 9 red sticks. The problem says there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, we add 5 to the number of red sticks to find the number of blue sticks:

\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 blue sticks.

Next, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, we subtract 3 from 14 to find the number of yellow sticks:

\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

So, there are 11 yellow sticks.

Now, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together:

\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks is 34.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Matteo and Shandy.

First, we calculate how far Matteo traveled. He drove at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate how far Shandy traveled. He drove at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. To find the distance, we multiply the speed by the time:
\[ 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more miles Shandy drove than Matteo. We subtract the distance Matteo drove from the distance Shandy drove:
\[ 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"To find out how many female students are at Brook Hills High School, let's break it down step by step:

1. The school has 3000 students in total.
2. Half of these students are over 16 years old. So, the number of students over 16 is:
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]
3. One-fourth of the students over 16 are male. So, the number of male students over 16 is:
   \[
   \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]
4. The rest are female students over 16. So, the number of female students over 16 is:
   \[
   1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]
5. The other half of the students are under 16 years old. So, the number of students under 16 is:
   \[
   \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]
6. Half of the students under 16 are male. So, the number of male students under 16 is:
   \[
   \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]
7. The rest are female students under 16. So, the number of female students under 16 is:
   \[
   1500 - 750 = 750
   \]
8. To find the total number of female students, we add the female students over 16 and the female students under 16:
   \[
   1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

So, the total number of female students at the school is 1875. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{1875}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, we need to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, so the difference is \(10 - 5 = 5\) laps.

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final answer is 5 laps."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much water is left in the tank.

First, we need to calculate how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day.

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda did.
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- So, the total water pumped on the first day is:
  \[
  4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
  \]

Next, we calculate how much water they pumped on the second day.

- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- So, the total water pumped on the second day is:
  \[
  3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

Now, we add up the total water pumped over the two days:
\[
7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Finally, we find out how much water is left in the tank:
\[
18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
\]

So, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank to be full is \( \boxed{6000} \)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Maria's power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours. This means that after 5 hours, the power bank has:
\[ 100\% - 9\% = 91\% \]
of its original charge left. So, after 5 hours, the power bank has:
\[ 91\% \times C = 0.91C \]
where \( C \) is the original charge.

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after another 3 hours, the power bank has:
\[ 91\% \times (1 - 7\%) = 91\% \times 93\% = 0.91 \times 0.93 \]
of its charge left. So, after 8 hours, the power bank has:
\[ 0.91C \times 0.93 = 0.8523C \]
where \( C \) is the original charge.

We know that after 8 hours, the power bank has 28% of its original charge left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 0.8523C = 0.28 \]

To find \( C \), we divide both sides by 0.8523:
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.8523} \approx 0.328 \]

So, the original charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 32.8%.

The closest option to 32.8% is 33%.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{33\%} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Janet earns $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total earnings per hour are $10 + $15 = $25.

If she works 40 hours a week, her total earnings for the week are $25/hour * 40 hours = $1000.

She wants to save up 20% of $10,000 for a down payment. So, 20% of $10,000 is $10,000 * 0.20 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide $2000 by her weekly earnings of $1000. So, $2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The answer is 2 weeks."
"Jamaar has $10 to spend at the store. He has already bought some fruits and we need to find out how much money he has left to buy plums.

First, let's see how much he spent on each type of fruit:
- He bought 3 peaches at $0.5 each, so he spent 3 * $0.5 = $1.5.
- He bought 4 pears at $0.5 each, so he spent 4 * $0.5 = $2.0.
- He bought 2 kiwis at $1.0 each, so he spent 2 * $1.0 = $2.0.
- He bought 5 apples at $0.75 each, so he spent 5 * $0.75 = $3.75.

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:
Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the money he has left after buying these fruits is:
Money left = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75, we divide the money he has left by the cost of one plum:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The answer is 3."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Anne bought a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of sweets is:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

She gave these 13 packs to her 10 friends equally. To find out how many pieces each friend got, we divide the 13 packs by 10 friends:
\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \]

Since each pack has 60 pieces, each friend got:
\[ 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each friend received 78 pieces of sweets. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{78}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the price of carrots after three years.

The price of carrots starts at $120 and increases by 5% each year. We need to find the price after three years.

First, let's calculate the price after the first year:
- The price after the first year is $120 + 5% of $120.
- 5% of $120 is $120 * 0.05 = $6.
- So, the price after the first year is $120 + $6 = $126.

Next, let's calculate the price after the second year:
- The price after the second year is $126 + 5% of $126.
- 5% of $126 is $126 * 0.05 = $6.30.
- So, the price after the second year is $126 + $6.30 = $132.30.

Now, let's calculate the price after the third year:
- The price after the third year is $132.30 + 5% of $132.30.
- 5% of $132.30 is $132.30 * 0.05 = $6.615.
- So, the price after the third year is $132.30 + $6.615 = $138.915.

Now, we need to round $138.915 to the nearest integer, which gives us $139.

So, the price of carrots after three years is approximately $139."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Olivia uploaded 72 pictures into 8 albums. She put the same number of pictures into each album. Out of these 8 albums, 3 are for selfies and 2 are for portraits.

First, we need to find out how many pictures are in each album. We do this by dividing the total number of pictures by the total number of albums:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Now, we know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. So, we can find out how many pictures are in the selfies and portraits albums by multiplying the number of albums by the number of pictures per album.

For the selfies:
\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

For the portraits:
\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Now, to find out the total number of selfies and portraits, we add the number of selfies and portraits together:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is 45. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

James reads 3 pages in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to read 1 page, we divide 10 minutes by 3 pages:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Now, James reads 18 pages. To find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages, we multiply the time it takes to read 1 page by 18:
\[ 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many guests are in the hotel now.

1. **Initial number of guests:**
   The hotel started with 100 guests.

2. **Guests who checked out early:**
   24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
   So, 76 guests are left.

3. **Guests who checked out late:**
   15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
   Now, 61 guests are left.

4. **Guests who checked in in the afternoon:**
   Twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 more guests checked in.

5. **Guests who checked in after dinner:**
   7 more people checked in after dinner.
   \[
   30 + 7 = 37
   \]
   Now, 37 more guests checked in.

6. **Total number of guests now:**
   Adding the guests who checked in to the remaining guests:
   \[
   61 + 37 = 98
   \]

So, the hotel now has 98 guests.

The final answer is \(\boxed{98}\)."

On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday. Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, on Friday he picks \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add up all the bananas he picked:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

So, the total number of bananas John has is 22.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. Today, Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned a total of $120.

First, let's find out how much money Teresa made from selling large stuffed animals. We know the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so:
\[ \text{Price of a large stuffed animal} = 3 \times 4 = \$12 \]

Now, let's say Teresa sold \( x \) large stuffed animals. Then she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The money she made from the large stuffed animals is:
\[ 12x \]

The money she made from the small stuffed animals is:
\[ 4 \times 2x = 8x \]

The total money she made is the sum of the money from the large and small stuffed animals:
\[ 12x + 8x = 20x \]

We know this total is $120, so:
\[ 20x = 120 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 20:
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small ones:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small stuffed animals. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to know how many sandwiches they eat in a day and then multiply that by 7 (the number of days in a week).

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is:
\[5 + 4 + 2 = 11\]

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week, we multiply the number of sandwiches they eat in one day by 7:
\[11 \times 7 = 77\]

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week. The correct answer is 77."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so she got:
\[ 80 \times 1 = \$80 \]

She also sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so she got:
\[ 60 \times 4 = \$240 \]

Adding these together gives her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave away:
\[ 2 \times 10 = \$20 \]

Subtracting the money she gave to her sisters from her total earnings:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \$300 \]

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. A dwarf with an iron pickaxe can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
2. A dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine twice as much as an iron pickaxe dwarf, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) pounds per day.
3. A dwarf with a steel pickaxe can also mine 50% more than an iron pickaxe dwarf. So, we add 50% of 12 pounds to 24 pounds. 50% of 12 is \(12 \times 0.5 = 6\) pounds. Adding this to 24 gives us \(24 + 6 = 30\) pounds per day.
4. Now, if we have 40 dwarves all mining with steel pickaxes, each dwarf mines 30 pounds per day. So, 40 dwarves will mine \(40 \times 30 = 1200\) pounds per day.
5. In a month with 30 days, these 40 dwarves will mine \(1200 \times 30 = 36000\) pounds.

But the question asks for the amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month, and the options given are:
A) 12000 pounds

So, the correct answer is D) 36000 pounds."
"To find out how much the package with 8 sandwiches costs, we need to use the information that the prices are the same per sandwich. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how much each sandwich costs in the first two packages:

1. The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3. So, the cost per sandwich is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6. So, the cost per sandwich is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the cost per sandwich is the same for both packages, we can use this price to find the cost of the third package with 8 sandwiches.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the third package:
\[
8 \text{ sandwiches} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that money to pay part of the new bedroom set. So, the new bedroom set costs him $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Now, he has to pay 10% of $2000 each month. To find out how much he has to pay each month, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = \frac{10}{100} \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Sally started with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons. First, a strong wind came and burst 40% of the red balloons. To find out how many red balloons burst, we calculate 40% of 25:

\[ 25 \times 0.40 = 10 \]

So, 10 red balloons burst. That means Sally has:

\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons left} \]

Next, Sally accidentally let go of half of the yellow balloons. She had 12 yellow balloons, so half of them are:

\[ 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \]

So, she lost 6 yellow balloons, leaving her with:

\[ 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

Now, Sally found 8 blue balloons and decided to add 75% of them to her collection. To find out how many blue balloons she added, we calculate 75% of 8:

\[ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 \]

So, she added 6 blue balloons. Now, let's add up all the balloons she has left:

\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 7 \text{ (green)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 34 \]

So, Sally carried 34 balloons into the school. The final answer is:

"To figure out the chance that Marcus has to turn in his homework, we need to look at all the different scenarios and how likely they are.

1. **Substitute Teacher:**
   - There's a 50% chance he'll have a substitute teacher.
   - If he has a substitute teacher, there's a 50% chance the substitute will collect the homework.
   - So, the chance he has to turn in homework if the substitute teacher comes is 50% of 50%, which is 25%.

2. **Normal Teacher:**
   - There's a 50% chance he'll have the normal teacher.
   - If the normal teacher comes, there's a 40% chance the teacher will give everyone an extension.
   - So, the chance he gets an extension from the normal teacher is 40% of 50%, which is 20%.
   - If he doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance he can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment.
   - So, the chance he convinces the teacher is 20% of 60% (since 60% of the time he doesn't get an extension), which is 12%.
   - The rest of the time, he has to turn in his homework. So, the chance he has to turn in homework if the normal teacher comes is 60% minus 20% minus 12%, which is 28%.

Now, we add up all the chances he has to turn in his homework:
- From the substitute teacher: 25%
- From the normal teacher: 28%

So, the total chance he has to turn in his homework is 25% + 28% = 53%.

Therefore, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **53%**.

The correct answer is **53%**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The Fine Arts Center can hold 6000 people. Out of these, 950 seats are for graduates and 300 seats are for faculty. So, we first need to find out how many seats are left for the graduates and their guests.

1. First, we add the seats for graduates and faculty:
   \[ 950 + 300 = 1250 \]

2. Now, we subtract the seats for graduates and faculty from the total capacity to find out how many seats are left:
   \[ 6000 - 1250 = 4750 \]

3. The 4750 seats are for the graduates to give to their friends and family. If we divide these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates, we get:
   \[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate will get 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Grandpa likes to eat jelly beans, but he eats different amounts depending on how big the beans are. He can eat 75 big jelly beans to feel full. Now, he can eat twice as many medium-sized jelly beans as big ones. And for every 3 small jelly beans, it's the same as eating 1 medium-sized jelly bean.

First, we find out how many medium-sized jelly beans he can eat. Since he can eat 75 big ones and twice as many medium-sized ones, we do:
\[ 75 \times 2 = 150 \text{ medium-sized jelly beans} \]

Next, we need to find out how many small jelly beans he can eat. We know that 3 small jelly beans are the same as 1 medium-sized jelly bean. So, to find out how many small jelly beans are the same as 150 medium-sized ones, we do:
\[ 150 \times 3 = 450 \text{ small jelly beans} \]

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans. The answer is \(\boxed{450}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days on jury duty. So, the total hours she spends is:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

She gets paid $15 each day for 3 days, so her total pay is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

She also has to pay $3 each day for parking for 3 days, so her total parking cost is:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's find out how much she earns after paying for parking:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she earns per hour, we divide her total earnings after expenses by the total hours she worked:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses. The answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Ted starts with $200. He buys 3 books, and each book costs $16. So, the total cost for the books is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, he buys 3 pencils, and each pencil costs $6. So, the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much Ted spent in total, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Ted spent a total of $66. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Richard wants to make a video of a science experiment where he drops a specific candy into a bottle of diet soda every 3 feet along his driveway. The driveway is 24 feet wide, and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet.

First, we need to find out how many bottles of soda Richard will need. Since he wants a bottle every 3 feet, we divide the total width of the driveway by 3 feet:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, Richard needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle. He does this by going from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, and so on, until he gets to bottle 8. To get from bottle 1 to bottle 8, he needs to go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

It takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. So, we multiply the number of intervals by the time it takes to go from one bottle to the next:
\[ 7 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is 35 seconds.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{35}\) seconds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Uncle Franky has two boxes of apples. Each box has 40 apples. So, if we add the apples from both boxes, we get:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} + 40 \text{ apples/box} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Now, Uncle Franky wants to pack these apples into packs of 8 apples each. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound. So, the cost for the Parmesan cheese is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 11 \text{ dollars/pound} = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, she buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound. So, the cost for the mozzarella cheese is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
\[ 22 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Amor will have \(\boxed{10}\) dollars left to buy meat."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Jim borrowed $50,000 each year for 4 years, so he borrowed a total of:
\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Before college, Jim had a job that paid $25,000 a year. After college, his job paid three times as much, so it paid:
\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

If Jim worked for 8 years (4 years in college and 4 years after college), he would have earned:
\[ 75,000 \times 8 = 600,000 \]

But he also borrowed $200,000 during his college years, so he needs to earn back that amount plus the money he didn't earn while in college. That's:
\[ 600,000 - 200,000 = 400,000 \]

Now, to find out how many years it will take him to earn $400,000 at his new job pay of $75,000 a year, we divide:
\[ \frac{400,000}{75,000} = \frac{400}{75} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \]

Since Jim can't work a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number, which means it will take him 6 years to earn the money.

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how much fabric Jim needs, we first need to figure out the size of each piece of fabric he wants to make. The bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

So, the length of each piece of fabric is:
\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ feet} \]

And the width of each piece of fabric is:
\[ 8 + 2 = 10 \text{ feet} \]

Now, to find the area of one piece of fabric, we multiply the length by the width:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how many letters the post office delivered from Monday to Wednesday.

First, we know that on Monday, they delivered 425 letters.

Next, we need to find out how many letters they delivered on Tuesday. The problem says it's 17 more than one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday. So, we calculate one-fifth of 425:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85 \]
Then we add 17 to 85:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]
So, they delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

Now, we need to find out how many letters they delivered on Wednesday. The problem says it's 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. So, we first find twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]
Then we add 5 to 204:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]
So, they delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

Now, to find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the letters delivered each day:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

So, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is 736. The correct answer is \(\boxed{736}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Molly is having a party and she invited 16 people. Out of these, 10 people want chicken salad and 6 people want pasta salad.

The chicken salad costs $6.50 per person. So, for 10 people, the cost will be:
\[ 10 \times 6.50 = 65 \text{ dollars} \]

The pasta salad costs $6 per person. So, for 6 people, the cost will be:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out the total amount Molly will pay, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad together:
\[ 65 + 36 = 101 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Johnny's dad lost $5 in the first race. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice what he lost in the first race. So, twice the amount lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\). Adding $1 to that gives \(10 + 1 = 11\). So, he won $11 in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times what he won in the second race. So, \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\). That means he lost $16.5 in the third race.

Now, let's add up all the losses:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (he won)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost: \(5 + 0 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[ \frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667 \]

So, the average amount lost per race is approximately $7.17.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.17}
\]"
"To find out how many people live in South America, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, we know there are 26 countries in South America. Each of these countries has 5 cities. So, we need to find out how many cities there are in total in South America. We do this by multiplying the number of countries by the number of cities per country:

\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we know that each of these cities has 1000 people living in it. To find the total number of people in South America, we multiply the number of cities by the number of people per city:

\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of people in South America is 130,000. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{130000}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Xavier was 4 feet tall, which is the same as 48 inches because 4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches. Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have three people dividing $1920. Let's say the first person took \( x \) dollars. 

The second person took $80 more than the first person, so they took \( x + 80 \) dollars.

The third person took twice what the second person took, so they took \( 2(x + 80) \) dollars.

The total amount they took together is $1920. So we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, we subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person took $420. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To find out how many hours each painter worked, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how many days the painters worked in total. The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 3 weeks is 21 days. So, the total number of days they worked is:
\[ 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours they worked in total. Since each painter worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day, and there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by all painters is:
\[ 7.875 \times 4 = 31.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many hours each painter worked, we divide the total hours by the number of painters:
\[ \frac{31.5}{4} = 7.875 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter worked for 7.875 hours. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.875} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. Let's say he retrieved \( x \) balls in the second set. According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

So, the total number of balls he retrieved is:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Let's solve this step by step:
1. Combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

2. To combine \( 2x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \), we need a common denominator:
\[ 2x = \frac{4x}{2} \]
\[ \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]
\[ \frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

3. Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 15 \]

4. Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

5. Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. Now, to find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 balls in the first set. The answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the year 2010.

Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007. The car loses 21% of its value each year. So, each year it keeps 79% of its value.

1. In 2008, the car's value is:
   \[
   20000 \times 0.79 = 15800
   \]

2. In 2009, the car's value is:
   \[
   15800 \times 0.79 = 12522
   \]

3. In 2010, the car's value is:
   \[
   12522 \times 0.79 = 9830.18
   \]

So, the price of the car in 2010 is $9830.18.

The closest option to $9830.18 from the choices given is $9800.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9800}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the Spanish books:

1. We know there are 50 books in total.
2. Half of them are in English, so that's \(50 \div 2 = 25\) books in English.
3. 10% of the books are in German. To find 10% of 50, we do \(50 \times 0.10 = 5\) books in German.
4. Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
   \[
   50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20.

The final answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To find out how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we start by noting the total distance from San Diego to New York City is about 1955 kilometers. Bernice has already driven 325 kilometers.

To find out how much farther she needs to drive, we subtract the distance she has already covered from the total distance:

\[ 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

So, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers. 

The correct answer is 1630 kilometers."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. We need to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

First, we calculate the total cups of water she drinks in 30 days:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we know that 16 cups make up 1 gallon. So, to find out how many gallons 240 cups make, we divide:
\[ 240 \text{ cups} \div 16 \text{ cups/gallon} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days. The answer is 15 gallons."
"Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people get off the train. Twice that number, which is 100 people, get on the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people get off the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]
   So, there are 110 people on the train at the final stop.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:
\[
\boxed{110}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear.

First, we know the cost of each item:
- The tank top costs $10.
- The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so that's $10 + $5 = $15.
- The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so that's $48 / 2 = $24.
- The athletic socks originally cost $8, but she had a $2 coupon, so that's $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up all these costs:
- Tank top: $10
- Running shorts: $15
- Tennis shoes: $24
- Athletic socks: $6

Adding these together:
\[ 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55 \]

So, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear. The final answer is $55."
"To find out how much it will cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to figure out how many tiles we need and then multiply that by the cost of each tile.

The kitchen floor is 200 square feet big, and each tile is 1 square foot because it's a square tile with each side being 1 foot long.

So, we need 200 tiles to cover the whole floor.

Each tile costs $12.

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile:
\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400.

The final answer is $2400."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

James's normal insurance cost is $120 a month. Because he had an accident, the cost goes up by 60%. First, we need to find out how much 60% of $120 is.

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{60}{100} \times 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the cost goes up by $72. Now, we add this to the normal cost to get the new monthly cost:

\[ 120 + 72 = 192 \]

This means James now pays $192 a month for insurance. To find out how much he pays in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

So, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Greg needs to wash sheets for:
- 4 twin beds, and each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- 1 king size bed, and each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.

First, let's figure out how many loads he needs for the twin beds:
- He has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets.
- So, he needs \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads for the twin beds.

Next, let's figure out how many loads he needs for the king size bed:
- He has 1 king size bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set.
- So, he needs \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load for the king size bed.

Now, let's add up the loads:
- Loads for twin beds = 2
- Loads for king size bed = 1
- Total loads = 2 + 1 = 3 loads per week.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the weekly loads by 52:
- Total loads per year = 3 loads/week × 52 weeks/year = 156 loads.

So, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is 156."
"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know they watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, so they watch \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies on Sunday.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

Since there are 4 weekends in 4 weeks, they watch \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) movies in total over 4 weeks.

Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 24."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. That's like having 100 candies in a jar.

Last year, he got 50 more stickers. So, if we add those 50 stickers to the 100 he already had, he would have:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]
stickers.

This year, he got twice as many stickers as he did last year. Since he got 50 stickers last year, this year he got:
\[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \]
stickers.

Now, if we add the stickers he got this year to the 150 he had at the end of last year, we get:
\[ 150 + 100 = 250 \]
stickers.

So, Leo now has 250 stickers in his collection. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them 60 grams of cat food twice a day. So, each cat eats:
\[ 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams per day} \]

Since there are 3 cats, the total amount of cat food they eat in one day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the amount they eat in one day:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days. The answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas. So, the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Becky ate 10 slices. Jake ate 3 slices less than Becky, so:
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, to find out how many slices they ate in total, we add up the slices each of them ate:
\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time for the meal was 98 minutes.

If we let the time Donovan's part took be \( D \) minutes, then Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time is the sum of both parts:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes more than Donovan's part:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out the total cost of the doctor's visit.

1. The cost of the cast is $200.
2. The doctor charges $300 for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, the cost is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. The doctor charges $4 for each painkiller and there are 30 painkillers. So, the cost for the painkillers is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. The doctor charges $6 for parking for 2 hours. So, the cost for parking is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add all these costs together:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

James gets 80 emails every day. Out of these, 20% don't need a response. So, to find out how many emails do need a response, we first need to figure out what 20% of 80 is.

20% of 80 is calculated as:
\[ 80 \times \frac{20}{100} = 80 \times 0.20 = 16 \]

So, 16 emails don't need a response. That means the rest of the emails do need a response. To find out how many emails do need a response, we subtract the 16 emails from the total 80 emails:
\[ 80 - 16 = 64 \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We do this by multiplying the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \times 5 = 320 \]

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week. The answer is 320."
"To find out how many classes visited the Science Center last week, we need to add up the number of classes that visited each day.

- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many visited as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
- On Wednesday, three times as many visited as on Monday, so that's \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

First, add 32 and 64:
\[32 + 64 = 96\]

Next, add 96 to the result:
\[96 + 96 = 192\]

Then, add 30:
\[192 + 30 = 222\]

Finally, add 25:
\[222 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."
"To find John's average score, we need to add up all his test scores and then divide by the number of tests he took.

First, let's add up all his scores:
- He scored 100 on his first test.
- He scored 100 on his second test.
- He scored 100 on his third test.
- He scored 80 on his fourth test.

So, we add these scores together:
\[ 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

Now, we need to find out how many tests he took. He took 4 tests in total.

To find the average, we divide the total score by the number of tests:
\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

So, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. To find out how many pizzas they ate, we do:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
So, they ate 14 pizzas and had:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]
pizzas left.

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
pizzas. They ate 80% of their pizzas, so:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
pizzas were eaten by the football team, leaving:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]
pizzas.

Now, to find out how many pizzas are left in total, we add the pizzas left from both groups:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the total number of pizzas left is 14. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Anthony wants to send 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. So, he will send 1400 big coupons.

Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he's sending 700 of them. So, the cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he's sending 1400 of them. So, the cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, to find the total cost, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 24500 cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Anthony spends 245 dollars on postage in total. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So, Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.
2. Then, Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches. So, Sidney had \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches left.
3. Sidney then ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches. Now, Sidney has \(3 + 3 = 6\) meatball sub sandwiches in total.
4. Each meatball sub sandwich has 4 meatballs. So, the total number of meatballs in the 6 meatball sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

Therefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24. The answer is 24."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks, and each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser. But two hours after the trucks left, 5 trucks had problems and couldn't deliver the fertiliser. So, the number of trucks that could deliver the fertiliser is:

\[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]

Each of these 15 trucks had 20 tons of fertiliser. So, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is:

\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

So, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 300 tons. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for making croissants and buying butter.

Dennis needs 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants. He wants to make 6 dozen croissants. So, he needs:
\[ 6 \text{ dozen croissants} \times 1 \text{ pound of butter per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter} \]

The store has a promotion: ""buy one pound of butter get one half off."" This means for every 2 pounds, Dennis only pays for 1 pound.

To get 6 pounds of butter, Dennis needs to buy 3 sets of 2 pounds because:
\[ 6 \text{ pounds} \div 2 \text{ pounds per set} = 3 \text{ sets} \]

For each set of 2 pounds, Dennis only pays for 1 pound. Since each pound of butter costs $4.00, the cost for 1 pound is $4.00. So, for 3 sets, he pays:
\[ 3 \text{ sets} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$12.00 \]

So, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \text{ guests} \]

But 4 people couldn't come, so the number of guests who will come is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \text{ guests} \]

The theater rental fee is $125 for the first 20 guests. For the extra guests, there's an additional fee of $6 each. So, for the 21 extra guests, the cost is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the base fee to the extra fee:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for the party is:
\[ \boxed{251} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Maggie had $60 and she spent a quarter of it. A quarter of $60 is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, Maggie spent $15 and has:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]
left.

Riza also had $60 and she spent one-third of it. One-third of $60 is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, Riza spent $20 and has:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]
left.

Now, to find out how much money they have left together, we add Maggie's and Riza's remaining money:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the total amount of money they have left is:
\[ \boxed{85} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas, and these are enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. We know that one monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So, in a week, the first monkey eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we add the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week:
\[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

So, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas in a week:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the third monkey eats these 147 bananas in 7 days, we find out how many bananas he eats each day:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Teddy started with a big puzzle that has 500 pieces. He finished half of it, so he put 250 pieces in place. Then, he started another big puzzle that also has 500 pieces and finished that one too. So, he put another 500 pieces in place.

Now, if we add the pieces from both puzzles together, Teddy put 250 + 500 = 750 pieces in place during that hour.

So, the number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 750."
"Jenny bought 15 roses, and each rose costs $2. So, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny had five $5 bills, so she had:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

Since the roses cost $30 and she only had $25, she needs $5 more. The florist will give her change in quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so to get $5 in quarters, she will get:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny will leave with 20 quarters. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money Terry makes in total.

First, we calculate the money from the milkshakes:
\[ 6 \text{ milkshakes} \times \$5.50 \text{ per milkshake} = 6 \times 5.50 = \$33.00 \]

Next, we calculate the money from the burger platters:
\[ 9 \text{ burger platters} \times \$11 \text{ per burger platter} = 9 \times 11 = \$99.00 \]

Then, we calculate the money from the sodas:
\[ 20 \text{ sodas} \times \$1.50 \text{ per soda} = 20 \times 1.50 = \$30.00 \]

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total money Terry makes:
\[ \$33.00 + \$99.00 + \$30.00 = \$162.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Paul needs to wait for the fourth train. Here's the schedule:

1. The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes.
2. The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves (which is 10 + 20 = 30 minutes) and stays for 5 minutes.
3. The third train arrives 60 minutes after the second train leaves (which is 30 + 5 = 35 minutes) and leaves immediately after it arrives.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves (which is 35 + 20 = 55 minutes).

So, Paul will wait for the fourth train for 55 - 10 = 45 minutes.

The answer is: 45 minutes."
"Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so she has saved 120 toothpicks. She needs a total of 200 toothpicks, so she still needs 80 more toothpicks.

If she saves 10 toothpicks each week, we can find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks by dividing 80 by 10.

\[
\frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks}
\]

So, it will take her 8 more weeks to collect the 200 toothpicks. The answer is:

\[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. The watch originally costs $2000.
2. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]
   So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

3. Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of what he paid. So, we calculate:
   \[
   1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]
   So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch for $1800.

4. Now, we need to find out what percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got. The original price was $2000, and he bought it for $1800. The discount amount is:
   \[
   2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]
   To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:
   \[
   \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

So, Mr. Rogers' friend got a 10% discount. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{10\%}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We know that one spring makes one jellyfish every second.
2. In one hour, there are 3600 seconds (60 seconds per minute and 60 minutes per hour).
3. So, in one hour, one spring makes 3600 jellyfish.
4. Now, we want to know how many jellyfish 5 springs can make in 4 hours.
5. First, let's find out how many jellyfish one spring makes in 4 hours. Since one spring makes 3600 jellyfish in one hour, in 4 hours it will make \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.
6. Now, if we have 5 springs working at the same rate, they will make \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish in 4 hours.

So, the number of jellyfish 5 springs can make in 4 hours is \(\boxed{72000}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Binkie's score is 90. Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. So, we first find out twice Binkie's score:

\[ 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Then we add 15 to that:

\[ 180 + 15 = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195. 

The final answer is:
\[ 195 \]"
"James decided to walk to the store, which is 4 miles away. When he got halfway there, he realized he forgot something at home, so he had to walk back. Let's break it down:

1. The distance from his home to the halfway point is half of 4 miles, which is 2 miles.
2. He walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.
3. To find out how long it took him to walk 2 miles, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.
4. So, the time to walk 2 miles is 2 miles / 4 miles per hour = 0.5 hours.
5. He then had to walk back 2 miles, which again takes 0.5 hours.
6. So, the total time is 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours = 1 hour.

Therefore, it took James 1 hour to reach the store. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, she gets a total of:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, if she buys the bananas individually at $0.80 each, the total cost would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

If she buys the bananas by the bunch, each bunch costs $3.00, so for 10 bunches, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money she saved by buying the bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying by the bunch from the cost of buying individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved:
\[ \boxed{2} \] dollars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. If we let the amount of fence Sam gets be \( S \) feet, then Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we subtract 60 from both sides to solve for \( S \):

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount of fence left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to figure out how much it grows each year. We know it grows 8 inches in 4 years, so we can calculate the growth per year by dividing 8 inches by 4 years:

\[ \text{Growth per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \]

Now that we know the crocodile grows 2 inches each year, we can find out how much it grows in 13 years by multiplying the growth per year by 13:

\[ \text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches} \]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles.

First, we need to find out how many of each type of bike Marcel sold:
- Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. So, the number of Trekking bikes sold is:
  \[
  \frac{300}{2} = 150
  \]
- 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes. So, the number of BMX bikes sold is:
  \[
  0.15 \times 300 = 45
  \]
- The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes. So, the number of MTB bikes sold is:
  \[
  300 - 150 - 45 = 105
  \]

Next, we calculate the total money earned from each type of bike:
- Each Trekking bike is sold for $450. So, the total money earned from Trekking bikes is:
  \[
  150 \times 450 = 67500
  \]
- Each BMX bike is sold for half the price of an MTB bike, which is $250. So, the total money earned from BMX bikes is:
  \[
  45 \times 250 = 11250
  \]
- Each MTB bike is sold for $500. So, the total money earned from MTB bikes is:
  \[
  105 \times 500 = 52500
  \]

Now, we add up the money earned from all the bikes:
\[
67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250
\]

So, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. So in 6 hours, the farmer makes:
\[ 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. So in 6 hours, the truck picks up:
\[ 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, to find out how many bales are left, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
\[ 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is 12.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Number of periods John takes each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - So, John takes \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Time spent in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Time spent in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - First, find the total weekly minutes:
     \[
     1600 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Then, calculate the extra learning time:
     \[
     \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Total time spent learning each week:**
   - Total time in class each week: 1600 minutes.
   - Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday: 100 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is:
     \[
     1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning in hours is:
     \[
     \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning. The closest option to 28.33 hours is 28.33 hours itself, but if we look at the options provided, it would be closest to 28.33 hours.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{28.33}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

First, we need to find out how high the ball is dropped from. Since each story is 24 feet and Nathan drops it from the third-floor balcony, we calculate the height as follows:
\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

Now, when the ball bounces, it reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its starting height. So, we calculate the height after the first bounce:
\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we need to find out how high the ball bounces after the first bounce. The ball again bounces to \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce. So, we calculate the height after the second bounce:
\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:
\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
   \[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
   \[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
   \[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
   \[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to figure out how many bags of apples they sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags that is, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find out the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000. 

The correct answer is: **1000**"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the triceratops, so it left half of the meat.
2. The velociraptors then ate half of what was left, so they left half of what the rex left.
3. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms.

Let's denote the initial amount of meat on the triceratops as \( x \) kilograms.

- After the Tyrannosaurus rex ate, \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms were left.
- The velociraptors then ate half of what was left, so they left \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
- The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, which means \( \frac{x}{4} = 270 \).

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]

Multiply both sides by 4:

\[
x = 270 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{1080}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Tony needs to paint four walls in a room. Two of these walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, and the other two are 5 feet by 8 feet.

First, we calculate the area of the north and south walls:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the east and west walls:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 40 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we add the areas of all four walls to find the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons of paint Tony needs, we divide the total area by the coverage of one gallon:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12. So, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. Ellen starts with 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them and leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken.
2. Ellen's brother then takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.
3. Ellen's friend now has to choose 1 soda from the remaining 4 sodas (2 shaken and 2 unshaken).

We need to find the chance that Ellen's friend picks a shaken soda.

- There are 2 shaken sodas out of the 4 sodas left.
- The probability of picking a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left, which is \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \).

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\% \]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is 50%.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

We have two trains traveling in opposite directions. One train is going 60 miles per hour, and the other is going half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

First, we need to find out how far each train travels in 3 hours.

1. **Distance traveled by the first train:**
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Time = 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. **Distance traveled by the second train:**
   - Speed = 30 miles per hour
   - Time = 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

Now, since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled.

- Total distance = Distance traveled by the first train + Distance traveled by the second train
- Total distance = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart. The correct answer is 270 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many days are from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days, so that's 31 + 19 = 50 days in total.

Billy takes 20% of these days off, so he works 80% of the days. That means he works 80% of 50 days, which is 50 * 0.80 = 40 days.

Billy works 3 hours each day, so in 40 days, he works 40 * 3 = 120 hours.

Billy can help 2 people in one hour, so in 120 hours, he helps 120 * 2 = 240 people.

So, the number of people Billy helps is 240. The answer is:

**240**"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Mary and John got married, and there were cars and buses parked outside the church. We need to find out how many people were inside the church after the wedding ceremony.

First, we know there were 12 buses, and each bus carried 35 people. So, we calculate the total number of people in the buses:
\[ 12 \times 35 = 420 \]

Next, we know there were 20 cars, and each car carried 3 people. So, we calculate the total number of people in the cars:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Now, to find out how many people were inside the church, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars:
\[ 420 + 60 = 480 \]

So, the total number of people inside the church is 480. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{480}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Mike is 24 years old. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we can find out Martha's age by subtracting 4 from 24. 

\[ 24 - 4 = 20 \]

So, Martha is 20 years old. Now, Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age.

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old. The final answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's look at the biggest slide:
- The biggest slide is 300 feet long.
- People slide down at 60 feet per minute.

To find out how long it takes to slide down the biggest slide, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's look at the second biggest slide:
- The second biggest slide is 240 feet long.
- People slide down at 80 feet per minute.

To find out how long it takes to slide down the second biggest slide, we divide the length of the slide by the speed:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[ \text{Difference in time} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks in one day. He takes a 30-minute lunch and 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long. So, the total time for breaks in one day is:

2 breaks * 15 minutes/break = 30 minutes

Now, we add the time for the lunch to the total break time:

30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

This means Bobby spends 60 minutes on his lunches and breaks each day. To find out how much time this is in hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

60 minutes / 60 = 1 hour per day

Now, we need to find out how much time this is over 5 days:

1 hour/day * 5 days = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so we calculate:

\[ 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total distance they all ran together is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles Amber and Micah ran from the total:

\[ 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sheila starts with $85.00 on her credit card.
2. She returns an item that cost $15.00. So, we subtract $15.00 from $85.00:
   \[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]
   Now, her credit card balance is $70.00.
3. She buys a frying pan that is 20% off $20.00. To find the discount, we calculate 20% of $20.00:
   \[ 20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]
   So, the frying pan costs:
   \[ 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]
4. She also buys a set of towels that is 10% off $30.00. To find the discount, we calculate 10% of $30.00:
   \[ 30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00 \]
   So, the set of towels costs:
   \[ 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]
5. Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to her new balance:
   \[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

So, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00.

The final answer is: **$113.00**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of these large jellyfish change color under UV light. When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. We need to find out how many jellyfish are in the tank.

First, let's say the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( T \).

- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of these large jellyfish change color under UV light, so the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \).

We know that when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Chris is 4 years old. Ben is two times older than Chris, so we calculate Ben's age as follows:
- Chris's age = 4
- Ben's age = 2 × Chris's age = 2 × 4 = 8

Now, Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we calculate Caroline's age as follows:
- Ben's age = 8
- Caroline's age = 3 × Ben's age = 3 × 8 = 24

So, Caroline is 24 years old. The correct answer is:

24"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary. Her current salary is $100,000.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary in retirement. Her current salary is $100,000.
   \[
   \text{Annual living expenses in retirement} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]
   Since she plans to save for 20 years, we need to find the total amount she needs to save over 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save \$800,000:**
   We know Lauren saves $20,000 per year. To find out how many years she needs to work to save $800,000, we divide the total retirement savings needed by her annual savings.
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

So, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. He first cuts this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find out how long each part is, we divide 100 by 4:
\[ 100 \div 4 = 25 \text{ cm} \]
So, each part is 25 centimeters long.

Next, Marty takes each of these 25 cm parts and cuts them into 5 equal parts. To find out how long each of these smaller parts is, we divide 25 by 5:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \text{ cm} \]
So, each of the final parts is 5 centimeters long.

Therefore, the length of each final cut is:
\[ \boxed{5 \text{ cm}} \]"
"To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to figure out the total number of students. We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. So, if 40% equals 240 boys, we can find the total number of students by dividing 240 by 0.40.

\[ \text{Total number of students} = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

Now that we know there are 600 students in total, we can find out how many of them are girls. Since 40% of the students are boys, the remaining 60% must be girls.

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 \times 0.60 = 360 \]

So, the number of girls in the school is 360. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{360}\)."

1. A set of pots for $19.
2. A sack of garden soil for $26.

So, the total cost before using the coupon is:
\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

Then, she used a coupon for $7 off. So, we subtract $7 from $45:
\[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add up the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

We have:
- Three women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height from these heels is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) inches.
- Three women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height from these heels is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

Now, we add these together to get the total height of all the heels:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

There are a total of \(3 + 3 = 6\) women at the party.

To find the average height of the heels, we divide the total height by the number of women:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches.

The correct answer is:
3 inches"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. June has 30 days. She plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, so that's 250 miles per day.

To find out how many miles she needs to hike each day to complete her journey in June, we divide the total miles by the number of days in June:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

Soledad plans to hike 250 miles per day. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we subtract her planned miles from the required miles:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles each day to complete her journey on time.

"To find out how much the store will have received after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total money made from selling each color of ball and then add them all together.

First, let's look at the red balls:
- There are 3 red balls.
- Each red ball costs $9.
- So, the total money from red balls is \(3 \times 9 = 27\) dollars.

Next, let's look at the blue balls:
- There are 11 blue balls.
- Each blue ball costs $5.
- So, the total money from blue balls is \(11 \times 5 = 55\) dollars.

Now, let's look at the green balls:
- There are 25 green balls.
- Each green ball costs $3.
- So, the total money from green balls is \(25 \times 3 = 75\) dollars.

To find the total money the store will have received, we add up the money from all the balls:
- Money from red balls: $27
- Money from blue balls: $55

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

Then, Tate buys more fish:
- 2 more male guppies
- 1 more female guppy
- 2 more male goldfishes
- 3 more female goldfishes

Now, let's add these to the initial numbers:
- Male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

So, Tate now has:
- 6 male fish (both guppies and goldfishes)
- 8 female fish (both guppies and goldfishes)

To find out how many more female fish there are than male fish, we subtract the number of male fish from the number of female fish:
\[ 8 \text{ (female fish)} - 6 \text{ (male fish)} = 2 \]

So, Tate has 2 more female fish than male fish. The answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John visits his parents twice a month. It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph. We need to find out how many miles he drives in a month.

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
- Speed = 70 mph
- Time = 2 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance one way} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \]

Since John visits twice a month, we need to double this distance for the round trip:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 280 \text{ miles} \]

So, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents.

The final answer is:
\[

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. So, in 7 days, she will walk:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

The problem tells us that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if we let \( B \) be the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we can write:
\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we divide 70 by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have 400 toys to make, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys. So, the workers made 400 - 20 = 380 toys in total.

There are 5 workers in total, and we know the production rates of 4 of them:
- 2 workers make 6 toys per hour.
- 2 workers make 4 toys per hour.

First, let's find out how many toys these 4 workers made in 10 hours:
- The 2 workers who make 6 toys per hour make 6 * 2 = 12 toys per hour.
- So, in 10 hours, they make 12 * 10 = 120 toys.
- The 2 workers who make 4 toys per hour make 4 * 2 = 8 toys per hour.
- So, in 10 hours, they make 8 * 10 = 80 toys.

Now, let's add the toys made by these 4 workers:
- 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys.

We know the total toys made by all 5 workers is 380. So, the fifth worker must have made:
- 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys.

Since they worked for 10 hours, the fifth worker must have made:
- 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

So, the fifth worker makes \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds. 

The correct answer is \boxed{105}."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, if Seth originally had \( S \) stickers, Luis got \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. So, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total. So, \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. To find out how many stickers Seth originally had, we solve \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \). Multiplying both sides by 4 gives \( S = 64 \).

So, Seth originally had 64 stickers. The answer is \(\boxed{64}\)."

We know that 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms. So, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the number of small bags John can make is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to find out what half of the Earth's circumference is. The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that would be:
   \[
   \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
   \]

2. Now, we know Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day:
   \[
   \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
   \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth. The final answer is 50 days."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we calculate:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Liam is 16 years old now. Two years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

The problem says that two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), then we can write the equation:
\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago, Vince was 7 years old. Since that was two years ago, Vince's current age is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and together with Sarah and Camden, they painted 56 eggs in total. Also, Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.

First, let's find out how many eggs Sarah painted. If Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Sarah's eggs} + (\text{Sarah's eggs} + 12) = 30 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2 \times \text{Sarah's eggs} + 12 = 30 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ 2 \times \text{Sarah's eggs} = 18 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ \text{Sarah's eggs} = 9 \]

So, Sarah painted 9 eggs. Since Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, Camden painted:

\[ 9 + 12 = 21 \]

Now, we know the total number of eggs painted by all four is 56. We can find out how many eggs Arnold and Madeline painted together by subtracting the eggs painted by Sarah and Camden from the total:

\[ 56 - (9 + 21) = 56 - 30 = 26 \]

Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we divide 26 by 2:

\[ \text{Arnold's eggs} = \text{Madeline's eggs} = 26 \div 2 = 13 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:

\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Nik has 200 crayons and he wants to put them into groups of 8 crayons each. So, he can make 25 groups. Each group of crayons will go into a box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons in ounces is 200 ounces (because 200 crayons each weighing 1 ounce). The total weight of the boxes is 25 boxes times 8 ounces per box, which is 200 ounces. So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes together is 400 ounces.

Now, we need to convert ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so we divide 400 ounces by 16 ounces per pound. 

\[ \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds. 

The correct answer is: 25 pounds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. John has a 80-foot tree. He can make logs out of 80% of it. So, he can make logs from:
   \[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

2. He cuts these 64 feet into 4-foot logs. To find out how many 4-foot logs he gets:
   \[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

3. From each of these 16 logs, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he gets is:
   \[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

4. He sells each plank for $1.2. So, the total money he makes is:
   \[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John makes $96. The correct answer is 96."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice that amount because she earns half of what he does. So, her brother earns:

\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Now, we add Valerie's and her brother's salaries to find their combined salary:

\[ 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so:

\[ 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Now, to find the total amount of money they all have together, we add Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's salaries:

\[ 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000.

The final answer is: **$45000**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Grandma walks 3 miles a day. She walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

First, let's find out how fast she walks on the beach. If she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk at this speed, the time it takes her to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time she spends on the beach and the time she spends on the sidewalk to find the total time for her 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk is 50 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Jane has been saving $4 each week for 8 weeks, so she has saved $32. She wants to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract $32 from $60:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Jane needs to save $28 more. Since she saves $4 each week, we divide $28 by $4 to find out how many more weeks it will take her:

\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The answer is:

7"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We have:
- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. So, \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds.
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. So, \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds.
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, we add all these together:
\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Bob starts with some marbles. If he gets 24 more marbles (because 2 dozen is 24), he ends up with 60 marbles. So, if we take away the 24 marbles he got, we can find out how many marbles he had at first. 

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob originally had 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have 26 marbles. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step.

Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other mug is an unknown temperature, which we'll call \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. This leaves 29 degrees in the 33-degree mug.

He also pours 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. The temperature of the water he pours from the other mug is \( T - 1 \) degrees.

Now, the total water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug). The average temperature of the water in the water bottle is:

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5}
\]

We know that this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink the water. So we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the inequality:

\[
29 + T - 1 \geq 200
\]

\[
28 + T \geq 200
\]

\[
T \geq 172
\]

So, the second mug must be at least 172 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water.

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{172}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Initially, the farm has 50 cows and 20 chickens, so that's a total of 70 animals.

Now, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows each day. Over 21 days (which is three weeks), they bring:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens each day. Over 21 days, they bring:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

So, after three weeks, the farm will have:
- 420 cows added to the initial 50 cows = 470 cows
- 210 chickens added to the initial 20 chickens = 230 chickens

Adding these together gives:
\[ 470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700. The correct answer is 700."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00. So, the total cost for 4 packs is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

If he gets a 10% discount, we need to calculate the discount amount:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after the discount, the total cost is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, each pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs have:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find out how much each single bagel costs, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we do:

\[
23 - 5 = 18
\]

Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. The problem tells us that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops. So, we calculate:

\[
6 - 3 = 3
\]

It takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops. Now, we need to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. We can set up a simple ratio:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
\]

To find \(x\), we solve the proportion:

\[
x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{27}

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate how many eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs} \]

Next, we calculate how many eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs} \]

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs:
\[ 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs} \]

Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs 240 eggs make:
\[ \frac{240 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20 \, \text{dozen} \]

So, Chester will need 20 dozen eggs for 60 days. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We know there are 17 green jellybeans. The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans, so:
\[ \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Now, we add the green and red jellybeans together:
\[ \text{Total of green and red jellybeans} = 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Since the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Tim grows 5 trees, and each year he gets 6 lemons from each tree. So, to find out how many lemons he gets in one year, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons each tree gives:

\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Now, a decade is 10 years. So, to find out how many lemons he gets in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in one year by 10:

\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

So, Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade. The answer is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. Together, they make 14 parts in total.

First, we need to find out how many parts each number represents. We do this by dividing the total number of passengers by the total number of parts:
\[ \text{Number of parts per passenger} = \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find out how many men and women there are:
- Number of men = 5 parts × 6 = 30
- Number of women = 9 parts × 6 = 54

So, there are 30 men and 54 women on the bus initially.

Next, 20 women alight from the bus. To find out how many women are left, we subtract 20 from the initial number of women:
\[ \text{Women left} = 54 - 20 = 34 \]

Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34.

The final answer is:

"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many sunflowers he sold each day. We know that he earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets of sunflowers. Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.

1. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - So, the number of bouquets sold per day is \(56 \div 8 = 7\) bouquets.

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers.
   - So, the number of sunflowers in 7 bouquets is \(7 \times 12 = 84\) sunflowers.

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers.
   - So, the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales is \(26 \div 2 = 13\) sunflowers.
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is \(13 + 84 = 97\) sunflowers.

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is \(97 \times 3 = 291\) sunflowers.

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is 291."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Adam has $100 to buy rocks. Each rock costs $5, so he can buy:
\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks} \]

He buys 20 rocks and then sells 60% of them. To find out how many rocks he sells:
\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Each rock is sold for $7, so the money he gets from selling 12 rocks is:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam started with $100 and spent $5 on each of the 20 rocks, so he spent:
\[ 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

But he only has $84 left after selling 12 rocks. So, the money he lost is:
\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Adam loses is:

"To find out how many days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the days for each type of picture scene separately and then add them up.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of large-sized scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:
     \[
     \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of medium-sized scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:
     \[
     \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.

     \[
     \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}
     \]

Now, we add up the days for all the picture scenes:
\[
9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days}

"To find the average speed, we need to add up the total distance Sid traveled and then divide it by the total time he spent traveling.

First, let's add up the total distance:
- Sid traveled 110 miles in the first part.
- Then he traveled 140 miles in the second part.
So, the total distance is \(110 + 140 = 250\) miles.

Next, let's add up the total time:
- Sid took 2 hours for the first part.
- Then he took 3 hours for the second part.
So, the total time is \(2 + 3 = 5\) hours.

Now, to find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. That means if we have 100 tickets, 20 of them are winners.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one. So, if the first ticket has 20 winners, the second ticket would have \(3 \times 20 = 60\) winners.

Now, we want to know the chance that both tickets are winners. To find this, we multiply the chances of each ticket being a winner:

- The chance of the first ticket being a winner is 20% or 0.20.
- The chance of the second ticket being a winner is 60% or 0.60.

So, we multiply these two chances together:
\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To change this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12\%}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jim collected 27 seashells. The problem says Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. So, if we let the number of seashells Carlos collected be \( C \), then:
\[ C + 5 = 27 \]
To find \( C \), we subtract 5 from 27:
\[ C = 27 - 5 = 22 \]
So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

The problem also says Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If we let the number of seashells Carrey collected be \( R \), then:
\[ C = 2R \]
Since we know \( C = 22 \), we can find \( R \) by dividing 22 by 2:
\[ R = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]
So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we add up all the seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:
\[ 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \]
They divided these seashells equally among themselves. Since there are 3 of them, each person gets:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]
So, each person got 20 seashells.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to add up the carrots he eats on weekdays and the carrots he eats on weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays. Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. So, we multiply 4 carrots by 5 days:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekends. Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday, and there are 2 days in the weekend. So, we multiply 5 carrots by 2 days:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the carrots eaten on weekdays and the carrots eaten on weekends to find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week. The correct answer is:
\[

"To find the total time of the cassette, we need to add the time of the first song to the time of the second song.

The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. So, we first calculate how much longer the second song is:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time of the first song and the second song together:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

Last Monday, he bought 2 devices, and last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices. So, the total number of devices he bought is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

The cost of 6 devices is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

He sells each of these 6 devices for $40, so the total money he gets from selling them is:
\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much profit he made, we subtract the total cost from the total money he got:
\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Linus made is:
\[ 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Isabel is 7 feet tall. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so we calculate Ned's height as follows:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Now, Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, we find the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - Each person needs 5 bottles of juice because 20% of a bottle covers 1 person's daily energy need, so 100% (which is the whole need) would be 5 bottles.
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Determine how many more bottles are needed:**
   - Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day.
   - The number of additional bottles needed is:
     \[
     11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
     \]

So, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles of juice to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7300}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Carla has 8 babies in total. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue.

First, we find out how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue:
- Number of babies in purple = 3/4 of 8 = 6 babies
- Number of babies in blue = 1/4 of 8 = 2 babies

Next, we know that 1/3 of the babies dressed in purple also wear bows. So, we calculate how many of the 6 babies in purple wear bows:
- Babies in purple wearing bows = 1/3 of 6 = 2 babies

We also know that 1/3 of the babies dressed in blue also wear bows. So, we calculate how many of the 2 babies in blue wear bows:
- Babies in blue wearing bows = 1/3 of 2 = 2/3 ≈ 1 baby (rounding to the nearest whole number)

Now, we add up the babies wearing bows:
- Total babies wearing bows = Babies in purple wearing bows + Babies in blue wearing bows = 2 + 1 = 3 babies

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the number of purple-wearers wearing bows and the total number of babies wearing bows:
- Percentage chance = (Number of purple-wearers wearing bows / Total number of babies wearing bows) × 100
- Percentage chance = (2 / 3) × 100 ≈ 66.67%

So, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately 66.67%.

The final answer is:
\[ 66.67\% \]"
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

The total number of reports received last week is 5168.

The number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.

The number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

So, we calculate the number of reports received on Wednesday as follows:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

Therefore, the number of tax reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Abraham has 80 square meters of land. He first sells half of it. Half of 80 is 40 square meters. He sells this 40 square meters for $50. So, the price per square meter is $50 divided by 40 square meters, which is $1.25 per square meter.

Next, he sells another 1/4 of his land. 1/4 of 80 is 20 square meters. He sells this 20 square meters for $30. So, the price per square meter is $30 divided by 20 square meters, which is $1.50 per square meter.

Now, he has 20 square meters left, which he sells at $3 per square meter. So, the money he gets from selling the last 20 square meters is 20 square meters times $3 per square meter, which is $60.

To find out how much money he earns in total, we add up all the money he got from selling the land:
- From the first sale: $50
- From the second sale: $30
- From the last sale: $60

So, the total money he earns is $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is **$140**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Haley is 26 years old. The problem says Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age. So, we first find half of Haley's age:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

Now, we need to take 10 less than this number:

\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

So, Geb is 3 years old.

The final answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. If he goes out three times a day, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days.

First, let's see how many face masks he uses in one day:
- He goes out 3 times a day.
- Each time he goes out, he uses 2 face masks.

So, the number of face masks he uses in one day is:
\[ 3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ face masks/outing} = 6 \text{ face masks/day} \]

Now, to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of face masks he uses in one day by 2:
\[ 6 \text{ face masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ face masks} \]

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days. The correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen would be:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs} \]

Lamar found 5 eggs.
Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs} \]

Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs} \]

Mei found half as many as Charlie, so:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs} \]

Now, let's add up all the eggs they found:
\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs they found from the total number of eggs Cole hid:
\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John has three apartment complexes. The first two complexes each have 200 apartments. So, together they have:
\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex has 60% more apartments than the first two combined. To find out how many apartments are in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400 and add it to 400:
\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \]
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

So, the total number of apartments in all three complexes is:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex. So, the total number of collections he makes in a week is:
\[ 3 \times 1040 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

John gets paid $0.40 for each collection. Therefore, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money John makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To find out how many fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years, let's break it down year by year:

- In the first year (5 years old), the tree produces 50 fruits.
- In the second year (6 years old), the tree produces 3 times the fruits of the first year, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- In the third year (7 years old), the tree produces 7 times the fruits of the first year, which is \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- In the fourth year (8 years old), the tree produces 200 less than a 10-year-old tree, which is \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.
- In the fifth year (9 years old), the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- In the sixth year (10 years old), the tree produces 20 times the fruits of the first year, which is \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits produced over the 10 years:

\[50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{1850}\)."
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $20. Jack originally had $100. So, if we add the $20 Sophia gave him to the $100 he already had, we get:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so if we let the length of the blue rope be \( B \) centimeters, then the red rope \( R \) is \( 4B \) centimeters.

We also know that the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so if we let the length of the yellow rope be \( Y \) centimeters, then the blue rope \( B \) is \( Y - 7 \) centimeters.

The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Since \( B = Y - 7 \), we can substitute \( B \) in the equation:
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters. Using \( B = Y - 7 \), we find the length of the blue rope:
\[ B = 12 - 7 = 5 \]

And using \( R = 4B \), we find the length of the red rope:
\[ R = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given three times as much, so she got $15.

After giving some money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave away 1/5 of her money to her sister.

If 1/5 of Rissa's money is $15, then 1/5 of $15 is $3. So, Rissa gave $3 to her sister.

Since Ronnie gave the same amount to her sister, Ronnie also gave $3.

So, the amount left with Ronnie is $5 - $3 = $2.

The amount left in Ronnie's money is $2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. The mural has four different colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. It's given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and half the mural is yellow.

First, we know that half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the red, white, and purple paints are equal, let's say each of these colors uses \( R \) pints. So we have:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom:
- Each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet.
- So, the area of one bedroom is \(20 \times 12 = 240\) square feet.

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area for the bedrooms is:
- \(4 \times 240 = 960\) square feet.

Next, we calculate the area of the living room. The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom:
- So, the area of the living room is \(5 \times 240 = 1200\) square feet.

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add up all these areas to get the total area of the house:
- Total area = Area of bedrooms + Area of living room + Area of the rest of the house
- Total area = \(960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160\) square feet.

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for Alice's cloud counting.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Monday, so that's \(3 \times 2 = 6\) puffs.

On Wednesday, she counts double the number of clouds from Tuesday, so that's \(6 \times 2 = 12\) puffs.

On Thursday, she counts double the number of clouds from Wednesday, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) puffs.

On Friday, she counts double the number of clouds from Thursday, so that's \(24 \times 2 = 48\) puffs.

Now, let's add all these up to find the total number of puffs of clouds she counts from Monday to Friday:

\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48\]

Adding these step by step:

\[3 + 6 = 9\]
\[9 + 12 = 21\]
\[21 + 24 = 45\]
\[45 + 48 = 93\]

So, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is 93.

The final answer is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We know the original box has 100 dishwasher pods and it costs $12.
2. The new box has 20% more pods than the original box. So, we need to find out how many pods are in the new box.
3. 20% of 100 pods is \(0.20 \times 100 = 20\) pods.
4. So, the new box has \(100 + 20 = 120\) pods.
5. The new box also costs $12, so the cost per pod is \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars.
6. If each cycle uses 1 pod, then for $1, you can run \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) cycles.

So, the number of dishwashing cycles you can run for $1 is 10.

The answer is: **10**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he gets, we divide $1000 by $20:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. He loses 10 bills on the way home. So, he has:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   So, he has:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills left}
   \]

4. He then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, his total money is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Tripling this amount gives:
   \[
   3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Finally, he converts all his money to $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, Thomas has 240 $5 bills. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

In the first half of the match:
- Team A scored 4 goals.
- Team B scored 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scored \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since it scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scored \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
- Team A scored \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals Team B scored in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scored \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

Now, let's add up all the goals:
- Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
- Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday.
2. By the end of Monday, he used 45% of the chalk. So, he used:
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   This means he has:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]
   of chalk left.

3. The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, let's see how much chalk he uses each day and how much is left after each day.

- **Tuesday**: 
  \[
  0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
  \]
  So, he has:
  \[
  2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
  \]
  left.

- **Wednesday**: 
  \[
  0.20 \times 2.20 = 0.44 \text{ inches}
  \]
  So, he has:
  \[
  2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
  \]
  left.

- **Thursday**: 
  \[
  0.20 \times 1.76 = 0.352 \text{ inches}
  \]
  So, he has:
  \[
  1.76 - 0.352 = 1.408 \text{ inches}

  0.20 \times 1.408 = 0.2816 \text{ inches}
  \]
  So, he has:
  \[
  1.408 - 0.2816 = 1.1264 \text{ inches}
  \]
  left.

- **Saturday**: 
  \[
  0.20 \times 1.1264 = 0.22528 \text{ inches}
  \]
  So, he has:
  \[
  1.1264 - 0.22528 = 0.90112 \text{ inches}
  \]
  left.

- **Sunday**: 
  \[
  0.20 \times 0.90112 = 0.180224 \text{ inches}
  \]
  So, he has:
  \[
  0.90112 - 0.180224 = 0.720896 \text{ inches}
  \]
  left.

Since the chalk is still more than 2 inches, he doesn't recycle it yet. He keeps using it every day.

- **Monday of the next week**: 
  \[
  0.20 \times 0.720896 = 0.1441792 \text{ inches}
  \]
  So, he has:
  \[
  0.720896 - 0.1441792 = 0.5767168 \text{ inches}
  \]
  left.

- **Tuesday of the next week**: 
  \[
  0.20 \times 0.5767168 = 0.11534336 \text{ inches}

  So, he has:
  \[
  0.5767168 - 0.11534336 = 0.46137344 \text{ inches}
  \]
  left.

- **Wednesday of the next week**: 
  \[
  0.20 \times 0.46137344 = 0.092274688 \text{ inches}

- **Friday of the next week**: 
  \[
  0.20 \times 0.2952790016 = 0.05905580032 \text{ inches}
  \]
  So, he has:
  \[
  0.2952790016 - 0.05905580032 = 0.23622320128 \text{ inches}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls. We need to find out how many students are not on varsity.

First, we calculate how many girls are on varsity. One-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate how many boys are on varsity. One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Now, we find out how many girls are not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

And how many boys are not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

To find the total number of students not on varsity, we add the number of girls and boys not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

So, the number of students not on varsity is 17. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mike bought 5 face masks. Now, Johnny bought 2 more than three times what Mike bought. So, we first find out how many face masks three times what Mike bought is. Three times 5 is 15. Then we add 2 to 15, which gives us 17.

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The answer is 17."
"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step as if you're a middle school student.

James has 30 teeth. His dentist does two things:
1. Drills 4 teeth.
2. Caps 7 more teeth than he drills.

First, we need to find out how many teeth the dentist caps. Since he caps 7 more teeth than he drills, we add 4 (the number of teeth drilled) to 7:
\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]
So, the dentist caps 11 teeth.

Next, we need to find out the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. This is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]
So, the dentist fixes 15 teeth.

Now, we need to find out what percentage of James' teeth the dentist fixes. To do this, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]
Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = 0.5 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = 50 \]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk from the company. Each gallon cost $3.5. So, to find out how much he paid in total, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

Mr. Marcellus later found out that 2/5 of the milk had gone bad and couldn't be sold. To find out how much milk went bad, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, the company will give him a refund for the 1600 gallons that went bad. To find out how much he gets back, we multiply the number of gallons that went bad by the cost per gallon:

\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mr. Marcellus gets a refund of $5600. 

The correct answer is: **$5600**"
"Let's solve this step by step.

We know Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. So, if Colin is \( C \) years old now, in seven years he will be \( C + 7 \) years old. Wendy's age now is \( 5(C + 7) \).

We also know that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So, in 25 years, Colin will be \( C + 25 \) years old, and Wendy will be \( 5(C + 7) + 25 \) years old. According to the second statement, \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \).

Let's solve this equation:

\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]

Expand and simplify:

\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Subtract \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:

\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]

\[ 40 = 2C \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin is currently 20 years old.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Bob has $27,000 to spend on books. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. First, we need to find out how many books he can buy with $27,000.

To do this, we divide $27,000 by $500 to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy:
\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]
So, he can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Now, we multiply 54 by 100 to find the total number of books:
\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]
Bob can buy 5400 books with $27,000.

Now, he wants to distribute these 5400 books equally among 3 schools. To find out how many books each school gets, we divide 5400 by 3:
\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]
So, each school gets 1800 books.

The number of books each school can get is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's count the apples step by step:

1. Initially, there are 2 apples on the ground.
2. Newton picks up these 2 apples, puts 1 in his pocket, and throws the other apple into the tree. Now, there's 1 apple left on the ground.
3. Newton picks up this 1 apple, puts it in his pocket, and throws the other apple at the tree. Now, there are no apples left on the ground.
4. Another 5 apples fall out of the tree. Newton picks up these 5 apples, puts 4 in his pocket, and throws the last apple at the tree. Now, there are no apples left on the ground.
5. Another 6 apples fall out of the tree. Newton picks up these 6 apples, puts them all in his pocket.

So, Newton has 4 apples in his pocket from the first interaction and 6 apples from the third interaction, which totals to 10 apples. But the question asks how many apples he brought home, and since he put all the apples he picked up in his pocket, the answer is 10 apples.

The number of apples Newton brought home is: **10**"
"To find out how much Ali's order of 850 kilos of coal costs, we first need to figure out how many 50 kilo bags he gets. 

He has 850 kilos of coal, and each bag is 50 kilos. So, we divide the total kilos by the kilos per bag:

\[
\frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Now, we know he gets 17 bags. Each bag costs $18. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is $306. 

The correct answer is: **306**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cheese pizza slices are eaten by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 6 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to find out how many cheese pizzas are needed for 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pepperoni pizza slices are eaten by Kate's 6 friends. Each friend eats 4 slices, so:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed for 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. Adding these together:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, the total miles are:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}
  \]

- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, the total miles are:
  \[
  5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}
  \]

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days:
\[
9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[
\boxed{19}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Jay can make 20 snowballs in one hour. But every 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt. So, in one hour, 20 snowballs are made, but 2 snowballs melt, which means only 18 snowballs are left after an hour.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for Jay to make 60 snowballs. First, let's see how many snowballs he makes in a shorter time, like 15 minutes.

In 15 minutes, he makes 20/4 = 5 snowballs (because 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour, and he makes 20 snowballs in an hour, so in 15 minutes, he makes 20/4 = 5 snowballs). But 2 snowballs melt, so he actually makes 5 - 2 = 3 snowballs in 15 minutes.

Now, to make 60 snowballs, we need to see how many 15-minute periods it takes. Since he makes 3 snowballs in 15 minutes, we divide 60 by 3 to find out how many 15-minute periods are needed:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ periods} \]

Since each period is 15 minutes, 20 periods would be:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert 300 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
\[ 300 \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that when the show came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John is 28 years old now, we need to find out how old Jim was then.

If John was 28 years old now, let's think about how old he was when the show came out. Since 28 is twice the age Jim was then, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2J = 28 \]

To find Jim's age \( J \) when the show came out, we divide 28 by 2:

\[ J = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jim was 14 years old when the show came out. Since no time has passed since then, Jim is still 14 years old now.

The final answer is: 14

So, the correct option is 14."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

Doxa sliced an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate 3 slices.

Now, let's add up how many slices they all ate:
- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 2 slices.
- Her brother ate 3 slices.

So, the total number of slices they ate together is \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).

The final answer is 6 slices."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 + 100 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used \(81 - 78 = 3\) bandages more than they needed to reach 78 bandages.

Since they had 81 bandages after ordering and using 25, and they ended up with 78, it means they used 3 more bandages than necessary. This confirms the calculations.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{62}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

May's hair was originally 10 inches long and she ended up with 8 inches of hair. So, she had 2 inches of hair cut off. The cost to cut her hair is $30 for every inch. So, for 2 inches, it would cost:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars/inch} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the hair color is $40. So, the total cost is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for May's haircut and color is $100. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{100}\)."
"To find out how much Jen will receive, we need to calculate her earnings from her work and her bonus for being on time.

First, let's figure out how much Jen earns in a day. She works 7.5 hours a day and her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she earns in a week. She works 6 days a week, so:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, her total earnings for April are:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270.00 \]

Jen also gets a $10 bonus for being on time each week. Since she didn't miss any days in April, she gets this bonus for 4 weeks:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we add her total earnings for the month and her total bonus:
\[ \$270.00 + \$40.00 = \$310.00 \]

So, Jen will receive:
\[
\boxed{310}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money Jason earned.

First, we need to calculate how much Jason earned for each task he did:

1. **Doing laundry:** Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from laundry} = 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Cleaning his room:** Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} = 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Taking the trash out:** Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out each week. Since he did this twice in the two-week period:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from taking the trash out} = 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Emptying the dishwasher:** Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher each time. Since he emptied the dishwasher 6 times:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher} = 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

Now, we add up all the earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00
\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{9.00}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we want to find out how much blood ten sharks have together. So we multiply the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is 1200 gallons. 

The correct answer is: **1200 gallons**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step like I'm explaining it to a middle school student.

On that particular day, Mr. Maxim counted the people who came into the restaurant.

1. In the morning, 50 people came in.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people came in. These 40 people ate the same amount of food as the first 50 people.
3. After that, twice as many people came in as the 40 who came at 10:00. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people came in.
4. By evening, 3 times as many people as the 50 who came in the morning came in. So, \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people came in.

Now, let's add all these numbers together to find the total number of people who came into the restaurant:

- Morning: 50 people
- 10:00: 40 people
- After 10:00: 80 people
- Evening: 150 people

So, the total is \(50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 260\).

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She also bought twice as many packs of black pens as red pens. So, she bought:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens} \]

Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, to find out the total number of pens Alain has, we add the red pens and the black pens together:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

So, the total number of pens Alain has is 75."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. So, the cost of one bottle of scotch is:
\[ \text{Cost of one bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, so he buys:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

Each bottle of cognac costs 50% more than a bottle of scotch. So, the cost of one bottle of cognac is:
\[ 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for the cognac:
\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends is:
\[ \boxed{2400} \]"
"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step as if you're a middle school student.

First, let's figure out how many trees Mr. Julius planted on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - He planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. So, he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Next, let's see how many trees he planted on the second day.

2. **Second Day:**
   - He planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day. So, he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - He planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. So, he planted \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than he did on the first day. Therefore, he planted \(40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

Now, let's add up all the trees he planted over the two days.

3. **Total Trees:**
   - White Oak trees: \(20 + 30 = 50\)
   - Lodgepole Pine trees: \(40 + 50 = 90\)
   - Total trees: \(50 + 90 = 140\)

So, the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"Let's work through the problem step by step to find out how much root beer is left for the party.

1. Fred starts with 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drink 4 gallons, so we subtract 4 from 24:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. Barbie spills 7 gallons, so we subtract 7 from 20:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. Ronnie drinks 5 gallons, so we subtract 5 from 13:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}

5. On the fourth day, 3 people show up for the party. To find out how much each person can drink, we divide the remaining 8 gallons by 3:
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons per person}
   \]

So, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is \(\frac{8}{3}\) gallons. 

The final answer is:
\[

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have the equation: \(4x + 8 = 40\).

First, we need to get rid of the 8 on the left side. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8\]
\[4x = 32\]

Now, to find \(x\), we divide both sides by 4:
\[\frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4}\]
\[x = 8\]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final answer is:
\[8\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We start with 66 fish in the tank. One-third of these fish have red stripes. To find out how many fish have red stripes, we do:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish are left after we take out the 22 fish with red stripes:

\[ 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Now, 5/11 of these remaining fish have blue stripes. To find out how many fish have blue stripes, we do:

\[ \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

To find out how many fish have either red or blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:

\[ 22 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes is 42. The final answer is \(\boxed{42}\)."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Amy starts with two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors. So, that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors.
2. She also has three makeup sets, each with 6 colors. So, that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors.
3. Adding these together, she has \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors in total.

Now, her sister takes one of the eyeshadow palettes, which has 4 colors. So, she loses 4 colors:
\[26 - 4 = 22\] colors left.

Next, Amy uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of that is:
\[6 \div 2 = 3\] colors.

So, after using up half of one makeup set, she has:
\[22 - 3 = 19\] colors left.

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Mattison is 60 inches tall. The house is 7 times as tall as he is, so the house is:
\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is three times as high as Mattison, so the first floor is:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches, the second floor must be:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is 240 inches.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells. So, we calculate:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \text{ shells} \]

Now, we subtract the shells found by Alphas from the total number of shells:
\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \text{ shells} \]

Next, team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells. So, we calculate:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 420 = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \text{ shells} \]

Now, we subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells to find out how many shells team Gogetters found:
\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \text{ shells} \]

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start by adding up the miles the first three dogs need to walk. The first dog needs 1 mile, the second dog needs 4 miles, and the third dog needs 3 miles. So, we add these together:

\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \]

Now, we know that the average distance all four dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. Since there are 4 dogs, the total distance they need to walk is:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

We already know that the first three dogs together need to walk 8 miles. To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the distance the first three dogs need to walk from the total distance:

\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. The correct answer is:

4 miles"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan that is 40% of that. So, we calculate the loan amount:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } 250,000 = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

John uses 60% of this loan to pay off his debts. So, we calculate how much he uses to pay off debts:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 100,000 = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

Now, to find out how much money he has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount he used to pay off debts from the loan amount:

\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is $40,000. 

The answer is: **$40,000**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Deandre caught three tunas. The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna weighs 46 kilograms, and the third tuna weighs 26 kilograms. We need to find out how much he will earn if he sells all the tunas at $0.50 per kilogram.

First, let's add up the weights of the tunas:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, we know that each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. So, to find out how much he will earn, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars per kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Deandre will earn **64 dollars**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Trinity bought the magazines for $72. She sells them at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of that price. First, we need to find out how much she sells each magazine for.

To find the selling price, we multiply $72 by \( \frac{11}{8} \):

\[ 72 \times \frac{11}{8} = 72 \times 1.375 = 99 \]

So, she sells each magazine for $99.

Now, to find out her profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}

Brian's dehumidifier has three settings:
- Low setting: 1 liter of water removed per day.
- Medium setting: 2 liters of water removed per day (twice the low setting).
- High setting: 4 liters of water removed per day (twice the medium setting).

Brian used the dehumidifier for different periods:
- 3 days on the low setting.
- 3 days on the medium setting.
- 5 days on the high setting.

First, let's calculate how much water was removed each time:
- For the low setting: 1 liter/day * 3 days = 3 liters.
- For the medium setting: 2 liters/day * 3 days = 6 liters.
- For the high setting: 4 liters/day * 5 days = 20 liters.

Now, we add up all the water removed:
3 liters (low setting) + 6 liters (medium setting) + 20 liters (high setting) = 29 liters.

So, the total amount of water removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters. The answer is \boxed{29}."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Jolene and her friends filled up 10 packs of water balloons, and each pack had 30 balloons. So, we first find out how many balloons they had in total:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the number of balloons they threw is 288. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{288}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much medicine is in one dose. We know that for one dose, Saanvi uses 14 mL of the first medicine and 3 times that amount of the second medicine. So, the second medicine is:

\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL} \]

Now, to find the total amount of medicine in one dose, we add the first and second medicines together:

\[ 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL} \]

So, one dose contains 56 mL of medicine. Now, we need to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses. We do this by multiplying the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \text{ mL} \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL} \]

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{448}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.
2. Each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class. So, we calculate 1/8 of 120:
   \[
   \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
   \]
3. John has two classes, so the total capacity for John's classes is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
   \]
4. Now, we add the capacity of Ali's class and John's classes together:
   \[
   120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
   \]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an extra 2%. First, we need to find out how much the extra 2% is. We do this by calculating 2% of $300:

\[ 2\% \text{ of } 300 = \frac{2}{100} \times 300 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Stephen needs to return is:

\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Now, Stephen will pay $25 each month for 11 months. So, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is:

\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he needs to return:

\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Jordan has 2 children, and each child needs 5 diaper changes per day. So, the total number of diaper changes per day is:
\[ 5 \text{ changes/child} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ changes/day} \]

Jordan's wife changes half of the diaper changes. So, she changes:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

This means Jordan changes the other half of the diaper changes. So, Jordan changes:
\[ 10 \text{ changes} - 5 \text{ changes} = 5 \text{ changes} \]

Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day. The answer is:
5"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. **Calculate the volume of the jar:**
   The jar is a square with each side being 6 inches and it's 15 inches tall.
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the effective volume for the jelly beans:**
   Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, we use:
   \[
   \text{Effective volume} = 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of jelly beans that fit in the jar:**
   Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches.
   \[
   \text{Number of jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of red jelly beans:**
   Tim thinks 30% of the jelly beans are red.
   \[
   \text{Estimated number of red jelly beans} = 2880 \times 0.30 = 864
   \]

5. **Determine how far off Tim's guess was:**
   The real number of red jelly beans is 900.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36

So, Tim's guess was 36 jelly beans off. The answer is 36."
"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The bus starts with 20 people on it.
2. At the first stop, 40 more people get on the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]
3. At the second stop, \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the 40 people who got on at the first stop enter the bus. So, the number of people who get on at the second stop is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]
   Adding these to the bus, the total number of people on the bus is:
   \[
   60 + 30 = 90
   \]
4. At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubles. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]
5. The bus has a total capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people can get on the bus, we subtract the number of people already on the bus from the total capacity:
   \[
   200 - 180 = 20
   \]

So, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. **Initial Cost per Visit:**
   The cost of one visit to the museum is $2.

2. **Cost After 5 Years:**
   The cost increased by 150%, which means it became 150% more than $2.
   \[
   150\% \text{ of } 2 = 2 \times 1.5 = 3
   \]
   So, the new cost is:
   \[
   2 + 3 = 5
   \]
   Now, one visit costs $5.

3. **Total Visits Over 8 Years:**
   Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year for 8 years.
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   So, she visits the museum 24 times in total.

4. **Total Cost for the First 5 Years:**
   For the first 5 years, she visits 3 times a year.
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15
   \]
   So, the cost for the first 5 years is:
   \[
   15 \times 2 = 30
   \]

5. **Total Cost for the Next 3 Years:**
   For the next 3 years, she visits 3 times a year.
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
   So, the cost for the next 3 years is:
   \[
   9 \times 5 = 45

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Cedar Falls Middle School has students in grades 4, 5, and 6. There are 10 students in each grade, so that's 10 students/grade × 3 grades = 30 students in total.

Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find out how many groups we need, we divide the total number of students by the number of students that can try at once:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 3.75 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the next whole number. So, we need 4 groups.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. To find out the total time, we multiply the number of groups by the time each group takes:

\[ 4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take 180 minutes for everyone to try the escape room. The answer is 180 minutes."
"John made 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each. To find out how much Ali has to pay, we need to calculate the total cost.

First, let's find out how much the wooden tables cost:
- John made 4 tables.
- Each table costs $20.
- So, the cost for the tables is \(4 \times 20 = 80\) dollars.

Next, let's find out how much the roof frames cost:
- John made 2 frames.
- Each frame costs $10.
- So, the cost for the frames is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the tables and the frames to find the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of tables + cost of frames
- Total cost = 80 + 20 = 100 dollars.

So, Ali has to pay John 100 dollars. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have a board that is 40 feet long. Ian wants to cut it into two pieces where one piece is 4 times longer than the other. Let's call the shorter piece \( x \) feet. So, the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet.

The total length of the board is the sum of these two pieces, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. The longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece, so:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The length of the longer piece is \(\boxed{32}\) feet."
"To figure out how much of Aiden's secret seasoning he needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Aiden makes 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. He wants to make 80 meatballs. To find out how many pounds of ground beef he needs, we divide the number of meatballs he wants by the number of meatballs he gets from each pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs he wants}}{\text{Number of meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that for every pound of ground beef, Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning. So, to find out how much seasoning he needs for 5 pounds of ground beef, we multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound:

\[
\text{Amount of seasoning} = \text{Pounds of ground beef} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"Luke has five windows, and each window is 35 inches wide. To find the total width of all the windows, we multiply the width of one window by the number of windows:

\[ 35 \text{ inches/window} \times 5 \text{ windows} = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Now, Luke needs to buy fabric that is 2 times the total width of the windows. So, we multiply the total width by 2:

\[ 175 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"To find out how much a 36-minute call would cost, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, we calculate:
\[ 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

For the next 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute. So, we calculate:
\[ 20 \times 0.2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the costs of both parts together:
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for a 36-minute call is $8.00.

The final answer is:

"To find out how much rain there will be on Tuesday, we start with the rain on Monday, which is 2 inches. The problem says that Tuesday's rain will be 1 inch more than twice the amount of rain on Monday.

First, we calculate twice the amount of rain on Monday:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we add 1 inch to this amount to get the total for Tuesday:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ inches} \]

So, the amount of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. We need to find out how many cupcakes she made if she has 5 people in her class and each person gets 2 treats.

First, we know the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

Let's say Carly made \( C \) cupcakes. Then she made \( 3C - 2 \) brownies because she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. Let's check:
- If she made 3 cupcakes, then she made \( 3 \times 3 - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \) brownies.
- The total number of treats is \( 3 + 7 = 10 \), which matches the number of people in her class.

Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

First, we need to find the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure:
- A basic manicure costs $35.
- A basic pedicure costs $40.

So, the total cost for both services without any discounts is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

The salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $75:
\[ 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

So, the cost after the discount is $60.

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total, and each nail art service costs $3. So, the total cost for nail art is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Now, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost of the manicure and pedicure:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Susan has 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year. So, that's:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

She also has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, that's:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues} \]

Lastly, she has 1 magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. So, that's:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's add all these up to find out how many magazines she gets every year:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since each issue is one magazine, she gets:
\[ \boxed{66} \text{ magazines every year} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

We know Samantha has 27 paintings. The problem tells us that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to Samantha's paintings, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has. 

\[ 27 + 12 = 39 \]

So, Shelley has 39 paintings. Now, the problem also says that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. To find out how many paintings Kim has, we need to subtract 8 from Shelley's paintings.

\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

1. In November, the toy costs $40.
2. In December, the price goes up by 80%. To find out how much it goes up, we calculate 80% of $40:
   \[
   0.80 \times 40 = 32
   \]
   So, the price in December becomes:
   \[
   40 + 32 = 72
   \]
   The price in December is $72.
3. In January, the price goes down by 50%. To find out how much it goes down, we calculate 50% of $72:
   \[
   0.50 \times 72 = 36
   \]
   So, the price in January becomes:
   \[
   72 - 36 = 36
   \]
   The price in January is $36.

So, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the day's lessons.

Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, for these lessons:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he has 2 lessons for veterans at a reduced rate. The reduced rate is 25% off the standard rate, so:
\[ 80 \times (1 - 0.25) = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

For the 2 veteran lessons:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons:
\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her quiz scores and then divide by the number of quizzes she took.

First, let's add up all her scores: 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60.

Let's add them step by step:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

So, the sum of all her scores is 630.

Now, we need to count how many quizzes she took. She took 9 quizzes.

To find the mean, we divide the total sum of her scores by the number of quizzes:
Mean = 630 ÷ 9 = 70

So, Sally's mean score is 70.

15"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them. To find out how many apples he ate, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

So, he ate 24 apples. Now, we subtract the apples he ate from the total:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, he gave 9 apples to his sister. Now, we subtract the apples he gave to his sister from the remaining apples:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
\]

Walter then sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find out how much money he received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[
27 \times 3 = 81 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Walter received \(\boxed{81}\) dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that's 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. To find out how many novels she wrote this year, we can set up a simple equation.

If 9 novels is 3 quarters, then 1 quarter would be 9 divided by 3, which is 3 novels. So, if 1 quarter is 3 novels, then 4 quarters (which is the whole year) would be 4 times 3, which is 12 novels.

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year. The answer is 12."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Michael is traveling at a speed of 50 km/hr. If he travels for 3 days, we need to find out how far he goes in those 3 days.

First, we need to know how many hours are in 3 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Now, if Michael travels at 50 km/hr for 72 hours, the total distance he travels is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find out what percentage of the total distance Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.
4. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, so for 4 pies, she used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.
5. To find out how many grapes there were at the beginning, we add the grapes used by Madeline and her brother to the grapes used for the pies: 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.

So, the total number of grapes at the beginning was 84. The correct answer is:

\boxed{84}"
"To find out how many teachers were at school, we need to start with the total number of teachers, which is 82. Then we subtract the number of teachers who were sick, which is 13. So we do:

\[ 82 - 13 = 69 \]

Now, we add the number of substitute teachers, which is 9, to the number of teachers who were not sick:

\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

So, the number of teachers at school that day is 78. 

The correct answer is 78."
"To find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one week. Here's what we know:
- The pasta costs $1.00.
- The cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- The gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, so it costs $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add up these costs to find the total cost for one week:
- Cost of pasta: $1.00
- Cost of cheddar cheese: $3.00
- Cost of gruyere cheese: $6.00

Total cost for one week = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply the weekly cost by 52:
- Total cost for one year = $10.00 * 52 = $520.00

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many minutes the custodian needs to clean all the classrooms. There are 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one. So, we multiply 80 by 15:
\[ 80 \times 15 = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert these minutes into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 1200 by 60:
\[ 1200 \div 60 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours each day. To find out what percentage of their day they spend cleaning, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Cleaning time}}{\text{Workday time}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

So, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms. This means they spend more than one full workday cleaning the classrooms in the given 5 days.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{250\%} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Elly has 110 books to organize. She has 4 shelves in total: 2 middle shelves, 1 bottom shelf, and 1 top shelf. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, so the 2 middle shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's add up the total capacity of all the shelves:
- Middle shelves: 20 books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

So, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books, and each bookcase can hold 55 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs. Since one dozen is 12 eggs, she bought:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The eggs cost her $2.40 for each dozen. So for 5 dozens, the cost is:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total money she makes is:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out her profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Skyler has 100 hats in total. Half of these hats are red, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

After taking out the red hats, we have:

\[ 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ hats left} \]

Out of these 50 hats, 3/5 are blue. So, we calculate the number of blue hats:

\[ \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30 \]

Now, we subtract the blue hats from the remaining hats to find out how many are white:

\[ 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, Skyler has 20 white hats. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and costs $18.00. But now, the store is giving $3.00 off a bag, so the bag now costs $15.00.

First, we need to find out how many sticks are in the bag. The bag has 30 sticks.

Now, we need to find out how much each stick costs. We do this by dividing the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks:
\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

So, each stick costs $0.50. To change this to cents, we know that $1.00 is 100 cents, so:
\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

Therefore, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many questions Audrey got right on the first test. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. So, we calculate:
\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]
So, Audrey got 42 questions right on the first test.

Next, we need to know how many questions she needs to get right in total to pass. She needs to get 70% of the total questions right. The total number of questions on both tests is:
\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]
So, she needs to get:
\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]
questions right in total.

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, we need to find out how many more she needs to get right on the second test:
\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]
So, Audrey needs to get 35 questions right on the second test to pass.

The number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Mary makes some strawberry cubes, and the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. She makes a total of 116 ice cubes.

First, let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \). Then the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is 116. So we can write:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Now, let's solve this:
\[ S + 5S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]
\[ 6S = 120 \]
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary made 20 strawberry cubes. Now we need to find out how many blueberry cubes she made. We use the formula for blueberry cubes:
\[ B = 5S - 4 \]
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

So, Mary made 96 blueberry cubes.

The number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \(\boxed{96}\)."

Ara has been playing basketball for 4 years, and she plays 40 games each year. So, the total number of games she has played is:
\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Now, in each game, she scores 21 points. So, to find out the total points she has scored, we multiply the number of games by the points she scores per game:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360 points.

The final answer is:

"Brendan started with 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left. When he went to search for them, he found 3 marbles, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. But one of those marbles he found was actually a bead, so he got rid of that. Therefore, he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The number of marbles Brendan ended up with is 7. 

Now, let's look at the multiple-choice options:
A) 4
B) 5
C) 6
D) 7

The correct answer is D) 7."
"To figure out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many customers Jason needs to see in the dealership to sell 15 cars. For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership. So, to sell 15 cars, we need:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers} \]
Since Jason can't have half a customer, he needs to see 8 customers to make sure he gets at least 15 cars sold.

Next, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership. So, to get 8 customers, Jason needs to make:
\[ 8 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 200 \text{ calls} \]

So, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars. The answer is 200."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to figure out how many flashlights they have. There are 4 people in the house, and each person gets 2 flashlights. So, we multiply the number of people by the number of flashlights each person gets:

\[ 4 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ flashlights per person} = 8 \text{ flashlights} \]

Next, we need to find out how many candles they have. There are 8 rooms in the house. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. So, we have:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ rooms}}{2} = 4 \text{ rooms with 4 small candles each} \]
\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ small candles per room} = 16 \text{ small candles} \]

And for the other half of the rooms:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ rooms}}{2} = 4 \text{ rooms with 5 medium candles each} \]
\[ 4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ medium candles per room} = 20 \text{ medium candles} \]

Now, we add the small candles and the medium candles together to get the total number of candles:

\[ 16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles} \]

Finally, we add the number of flashlights and the number of candles to find the total number of items they are using:

\[ 8 \text{ flashlights} + 36 \text{ candles} = 44 \text{ items} \]

So, the total number of candles and flashlights they are using is 44. The correct answer is:

"To find out how long it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to add up the time he spends on each side. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **First side:** It takes John 5 minutes.
2. **Second side:** This side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
3. **Third side:** This side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
4. **Fourth side:** This side takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(0.5 \times 5 = 2.5\) minutes.
5. **Fifth side:** This side also takes half as long as the first side, so it takes \(0.5 \times 5 = 2.5\) minutes.

Now, let's add up all the times:
\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know there are 20 helmets. The problem says there are half as many robots as helmets, so we divide the number of helmets by 2 to find the number of robots:
\[ \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

It also says there are half as many helmets as footballs. So, if we double the number of helmets to find the number of footballs:
\[ \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Now, to find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together:
\[ \text{Total number of items} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tim works 6 hours each day at his job. That means in one week, he works:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes:
\[ 30 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, we know it takes Tim 15 minutes to handle one call. To find out how many calls he can handle in a week, we divide the total minutes he works in a week by the time it takes to handle one call:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step for a middle school level understanding.

Louise usually dries one painting in 7 minutes. Today, she is using a new varnish that takes 12 minutes to dry one painting.

First, we calculate how long it takes to dry 6 paintings with the old varnish:
- For one painting, it takes 7 minutes.
- For 6 paintings, it takes \(7 \times 6 = 42\) minutes.

Next, we calculate how long it takes to dry 6 paintings with the new varnish:
- For one painting, it takes 12 minutes.
- For 6 paintings, it takes \(12 \times 6 = 72\) minutes.

Now, we find out how much longer it takes with the new varnish:
- The difference is \(72 - 42 = 30\) minutes.

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much water Crista needs every day for her plants.

First, we know Crista has 20 plants in total.

- 4 of her plants need half a cup of water each day. So, for these 4 plants, she needs \(4 \times 0.5 = 2\) cups of water.
- 8 of her plants need 1 cup of water each day. So, for these 8 plants, she needs \(8 \times 1 = 8\) cups of water.
- The rest of the plants are \(20 - 4 - 8 = 8\) plants. These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each day. So, for these 8 plants, she needs \(8 \times 0.25 = 2\) cups of water.

Now, we add up all the water needed:
- Water for the first group of plants: 2 cups
- Water for the second group of plants: 8 cups
- Water for the third group of plants: 2 cups

So, the total amount of water Crista needs every day is \(2 + 8 + 2 = 12\) cups.

Therefore, Crista needs \(\boxed{12}\) cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it takes Phineas to get home. He has to travel 200 yards in total, and half of that distance is on land and the other half is in water. So, he has to travel 100 yards on land and 100 yards in water.

First, let's calculate how long it takes him to hop 100 yards on land. He hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. So, we divide the distance by his speed:
\[ \text{Time on land} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate how long it takes him to swim 100 yards in water. He swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. So, we divide the distance by his swimming speed:
\[ \text{Time in water} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time he spends on land and the time he spends in water to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes Phineas to return home is 15 minutes. The correct answer is:

"Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project. Each box of popsicle sticks has 8 sticks in it and costs $2.00. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of sticks by the number of sticks in each box:

\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{56 \text{ sticks}}{8 \text{ sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Now, to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00 \]

So, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the main phone costs $20. The problem says the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. So, if the main phone costs $20, then each additional phone costs half of that. 

\[ \text{Cost of each additional phone} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

There are five phones in total, and one of them is the main phone. So, there are four additional phones. 

\[ \text{Total cost of additional phones} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the total cost of the additional phones:

\[ \text{Total cost of the whole phone plan} = 20 + 40 = 60 \]

So, the total cost of the whole phone plan is $60. 

The correct answer is: **60**"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

First, let's figure out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. He makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day. Since one dozen is 12 doughnuts, we can calculate the number of doughnuts he makes in a day as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts he makes in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Now, we know that each doughnut is sold for $2. So, to find out how much money he makes, we multiply the total number of doughnuts by the price per doughnut:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is:
\[ \boxed{7200} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Jade took 210 photos. She wants to upload them on Instagram, and she can upload 7 photos in one batch. So, if she uploads 7 photos each time, we can find out how many times she needs to upload to finish all 210 photos.

First, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload in one batch:
\[ 210 \div 7 = 30 \]

This means she needs to upload 30 times to finish all the photos. Since she uploads 6 batches each day, we need to find out how many days it will take to upload 30 times.

We divide the total number of uploads by the number of uploads she can do in one day:
\[ 30 \div 6 = 5 \]

So, Jade will need 5 days to upload all her photos. The answer is \(\boxed{5}\) days."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for easier understanding.

Alicia has clothes to send to the dry cleaners every week. Here's what she has:
- 5 blouses
- 2 pairs of pants
- 1 skirt

The dry cleaners charge:
- $5.00 for each blouse
- $6.00 for each skirt
- $8.00 for each pair of pants

First, we calculate the cost for each type of clothing for one week:
- Cost for blouses: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 \text{ per blouse} = \$25.00\)
- Cost for pants: \(2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 \text{ per pair} = \$16.00\)
- Cost for skirt: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 \text{ per skirt} = \$6.00\)

Now, we add these costs together to find the total cost for one week:
\[
\$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00
\]

Since Alicia needs to do this every week for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
\[
\$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00
\]

So, Alicia spends \(\boxed{235.00}\) on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, he can speak 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:
\[ 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages. So, the total number of words is:
\[ 10 \times 450 = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. We do this by dividing the total number of words by his new speed:
\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take him 12 minutes to speak 10 pages. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many people Conor saw at the beach that week.

1. **First Day:**
   Conor found 50 people at the beach.

2. **Second Day:**
   The number of people on the second day was 20 more than on the first day.
   \[
   50 + 20 = 70
   \]
   So, 70 people were at the beach on the second day.

3. **Third Day:**
   The number of people on the third day was twice the number on the second day.
   \[
   2 \times 70 = 140
   \]
   So, 140 people were at the beach on the third day.

4. **Average Number of People for the Rest of the Week:**
   Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week (which includes the fourth, fifth, and sixth days).

5. **Total Number of People for the Rest of the Week:**
   Since there are 3 days left in the week and the average is 60 people per day:
   \[
   3 \times 60 = 180
   \]
   So, 180 people were at the beach for the rest of the week.

6. **Total Number of People for the Entire Week:**
   Adding the number of people from the first three days to the total number of people for the rest of the week:
   \[
   50 + 70 + 140 + 180 = 440
   \]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 440.

The correct answer is \boxed{440}."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the total number of kernels that popped is:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon needs 1 cup of lemon juice. So, he needs:
\[ 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice} \]

He also needs to make an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart. This extra gallon also needs 1 cup of lemon juice.

So, the total lemon juice needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we know that 6 lemons can make 1 cup of lemon juice. So, for 5 cups of lemon juice, Tim will need:
\[ 5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, Tim will need \(\boxed{30}\) lemons."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food a day, and each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of dog food a day.

First, let's find out how much dog food the German Shepherds eat in a day:
- 3 German Shepherds × 5 kg/German Shepherd = 15 kg

Next, let's find out how much dog food the Bulldogs eat in a day:
- 2 Bulldogs × 3 kg/Bulldog = 6 kg

Now, let's add the dog food eaten by the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs in a day:
- 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg

This means the kennel eats 21 kilograms of dog food every day. To find out how much they eat in a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
- 21 kg/day × 7 days/week = 147 kg

So, the kennel will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week. The answer is 147."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have 10 animals that are 2-legged and 15 animals that are 4-legged. We need to find out how many pairs of legs there are in total.

First, let's find out how many legs the 2-legged animals have:
- 10 animals * 2 legs each = 20 legs

Next, let's find out how many legs the 4-legged animals have:
- 15 animals * 4 legs each = 60 legs

Now, let's add the legs together:
- 20 legs + 60 legs = 80 legs

To find out how many pairs of legs there are, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
- 80 legs ÷ 2 = 40 pairs

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40. The correct answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the tower has:
- 4 blue blocks
- Twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, so that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) yellow blocks
- An unknown number of red blocks

The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

So, we can write the equation for the total number of blocks:
\[ \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} + \text{Number of red blocks} = 32 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplifying this:
\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find out how many red blocks there are, we subtract 12 from 32:
\[ R = 32 - 12 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

So, the number of red blocks is 20.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in both directions and then find the net distance.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at a speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at a speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find out how far he is from his house. Since he drove west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final answer is: 54 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much the boat is worth after three years of depreciation.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat originally costs $9000. It loses 30% of its value in the first year.
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 9000 = 0.30 \times 9000 = 2700
   \]
   So, after the first year, the boat is worth:
   \[
   9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   In the second year, the boat loses another 30% of its value, but this time it's based on the new value of $6300.
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 6300 = 0.30 \times 6300 = 1890
   \]
   So, after the second year, the boat is worth:
   \[
   6300 - 1890 = 4410

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   In the third year, the boat loses 20% of its value based on the new value of $4410.
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 4410 = 0.20 \times 4410 = 882
   \]
   So, after the third year, the boat is worth:
   \[
   4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Therefore, the boat is worth \(\boxed{3528}\) dollars after three years."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the bag has 232 pieces of Starbursts candy. We also know there are 54 red candies. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so:

\[ \text{Number of orange candies} = 2 \times 54 = 108 \]

The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so:

\[ \text{Number of yellow candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:

\[ 54 \text{ (red)} + 108 \text{ (orange)} + 27 \text{ (yellow)} = 189 \]

To find out how many pink candies there are, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:

\[ 232 - 189 = 43 \]

So, the number of pink candies is 43. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{43}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the trip Helen took.

First, we know Helen stayed in a hotel for 3 nights. Each night costs $80. So, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]
So, the hotel cost is $240.

Next, Helen rode the bus 7 times. Each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. Since one night at the hotel costs $80, each bus trip costs:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \]
So, each bus trip costs $8. For 7 bus trips, the total cost is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]
So, the bus cost is $56.

Now, to find out how much Helen paid in total for the hotel and bus trips, we add the hotel cost and the bus cost together:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \]

So, Helen paid a total of $296 for her trip. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Mazie started with 52 marbles. After Dallas dropped 4 marbles, he had 17 marbles left. So, the total number of marbles given to both Dallas and Darla is:
\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

Dallas got 17 marbles, so the rest must have gone to Darla. To find out how many marbles Darla got, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas got from the total number of marbles given away:
\[ 35 - 17 = 18 \]

So, Darla got 18 marbles. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

First, we need to find out how much the tickets cost. There are 2 adults and 1 child. Each adult ticket costs $12, so for 2 adults, it's:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the child ticket costs $8, so for 1 child, it's:
\[ 1 \times 8 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, they also bought 2 popcorns, and each popcorn costs $3. So for 2 popcorns, it's:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total cost, we add up all these amounts:
\[ 24 + 8 + 6 = 38 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount they pay is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total weight of the car and all the stuff in it. The car weighs 1200 pounds, and there's 250 pounds of luggage. John also has two children, and each child weighs 75 pounds. So, we add all these weights together:

\[ 1200 \text{ pounds (car)} + 250 \text{ pounds (luggage)} + 75 \text{ pounds (first child)} + 75 \text{ pounds (second child)} \]

\[ 1200 + 250 + 75 + 75 = 1600 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find out what 1% of this total weight is. To do this, we multiply 1600 by 0.01:

\[ 1600 \times 0.01 = 16 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds. 

The correct answer is: **16 pounds**"
"To figure out how many feet of crepe paper James needs, we need to calculate the perimeter of his backyard fence. The fence is a rectangle that is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

So, we plug in the numbers:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (20 + 15) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 35 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 70 \]

Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Mia is 40 years old and she is younger than Emma. They are 16 years apart in age. So, to find Emma's age, we add 16 years to Mia's age:

\[ 40 + 16 = 56 \]

So, Emma is 56 years old.

Now, to find the average of their ages, we add Mia's age and Emma's age together and then divide by 2:

\[ \frac{40 + 56}{2} = \frac{96}{2} = 48 \]

So, the average of their ages is 48.

The correct answer is 48."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Tom found 214 seashells, Nancy found 432 seashells, and Benny found 86 seashells. So, the total number of seashells they found together is:
\[ 214 + 432 + 86 = 732 \]

But then they found out that 67 of these seashells were cracked. So, to find out how many good seashells they have, we need to subtract the cracked seashells from the total:
\[ 732 - 67 = 665 \]

So, the number of good seashells they found together is 665.

The final answer is 665."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Avery needs a 3-piece place setting for her holiday dinner. Each place setting includes a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl. She's having 12 people over, so she needs 12 of these place settings.

First, let's find out how much one place setting costs:
- The dinner plate costs $6.00.
- The salad plate costs $4.00.
- The bowl costs $5.00.

To find the total cost of one place setting, we add these costs together:
\[ 6.00 + 4.00 + 5.00 = 15.00 \]

So, one place setting costs $15.00. Since Avery needs 12 place settings, we multiply the cost of one place setting by 12:
\[ 15.00 \times 12 = 180.00 \]

Therefore, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings.

The final answer is: \boxed{180.00}"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Steve took 10 hours to finish the puzzle. Anna took 2 hours more than half the time Steve took. First, we find half of Steve's time:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we add 2 more hours to that:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

So, Anna took 7 hours to finish the puzzle. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Dexter has 5 pigs, and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. So, each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, for 5 pigs:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

This is the total amount of feed the pigs eat in one day. Now, we need to find out how much feed they eat in a week (7 days):
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. So, the amount of feed left after a week is:
\[ 300 \text{ pounds} - 280 \text{ pounds} = 20 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of feed left after a week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John invited 20 people to a party, and each person will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/person} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs from a previous party. So, he needs to buy:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2. To find out how many packs he needs to buy, we divide the number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs in each pack:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Now, to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much Frances makes from selling cupcakes and cookies.

She sells 20 cupcakes at $2 each:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \]
So, she makes $40 from cupcakes.

She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each:
\[ 40 \times 1 = 40 \]
So, she makes $40 from cookies.

Now, we add the money she makes from cupcakes and cookies:
\[ 40 + 40 = 80 \]
So, she makes a total of $80 from selling cupcakes and cookies.

Next, we need to find out how much she spends on the trays of cookies. She buys 5 trays at $4 each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \]
So, she spends $20 on the trays.

Now, we subtract the money she spent from the money she made:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

So, Frances has $60 left. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. At the start, there are 5 children following the ice cream truck.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child. So, we add 5 more children to the group. That makes it \(5 + 5 = 10\) children.
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children. So, we add \(10 \times 2 = 20\) more children to the group. That makes it \(10 + 20 = 30\) children.
4. By the time the truck reaches the end of the third street, the original 5 children give up and leave. So, we subtract those 5 children from the 30 children. That leaves us with \(30 - 5 = 25\) children.

So, the number of children following the truck is 25. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mamou was supposed to give out 1,360 meals. She gave out meals on three days: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

On Friday, she gave out 64 meals.
On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals.
On Sunday, she gave out 48 meals.

First, we need to find out how many meals she gave out in total over these three days. We add the meals given out each day:
64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Now, we know she was supposed to give out 1,360 meals in total. To find out how many meals she has left, we subtract the total meals given out from the total meals she was supposed to give out:
1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

So, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is 1,218.

The correct answer is 1,218 meals."
"James finds a quarter, which is 25 cents. He also finds two nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so two nickels are worth:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents} \]

He also finds seven dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so seven dimes are worth:
\[ 7 \times 10 = 70 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we add up all the cents:
\[ 25 \text{ cents (quarter)} + 10 \text{ cents (nickels)} + 70 \text{ cents (dimes)} = 105 \text{ cents} \]

So, James has 105 cents. The correct answer is:

We have 2 brothers and 3 sisters. The sisters are all 16 years old. So, the total age of the sisters is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ years} \]

One of the brothers is 12 years old. The older brother is twice that age, so:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add the ages of all the siblings together:
\[ 48 \text{ (sisters)} + 12 \text{ (younger brother)} + 24 \text{ (older brother)} = 84 \text{ years} \]

So, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years. The correct answer is 84."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night. So, she meditates for a total of 30 minutes each day. She does this 5 days a week. So, in one week, she meditates for:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 150 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Over 4 weeks, she would meditate for:
\[ 150 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 600 \text{ minutes} \]

She also does yoga for 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) every day. She does yoga 5 days a week. So, in one week, she does yoga for:
\[ 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Over 4 weeks, she would do yoga for:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, to find out the total time she spends on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks, we add the time she spends on meditation and the time she spends on yoga:
\[ 600 \text{ minutes} + 1200 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert 1800 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 30 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks is 30 hours. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find out the total square footage of the quilt, we need to add up the square footage from all the t-shirts Octavia is using.

First, let's calculate the square footage from the small t-shirts:
- Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
- Octavia uses 11 small t-shirts.
- So, the total square footage from small t-shirts is \(11 \times 3 = 33\) square feet.

Next, let's calculate the square footage from the medium t-shirts:
- Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
- Octavia uses 8 medium t-shirts.
- So, the total square footage from medium t-shirts is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square feet.

Then, let's calculate the square footage from the large t-shirts:
- Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
- Octavia uses 6 large t-shirts.
- So, the total square footage from large t-shirts is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square feet.

Now, we add up all these square footages to get the total square footage of the quilt:
- Total square footage = square footage from small t-shirts + square footage from medium t-shirts + square footage from large t-shirts
- Total square footage = \(33 + 32 + 36 = 101\) square feet.

So, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen is 12 seeds, a small sunflower has:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find out how many more seeds that is, we calculate 50% of 36 seeds:
\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

So, a large sunflower has:
\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds together:
\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know George has 18 pens. Timothy has three times as many pens as George, so we calculate:

\[ 3 \times 18 = 54 \]

So, Timothy has 54 pens.

Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so we calculate:

\[ \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how tall Anne is. Since Anne is twice as tall as Albert and Albert is 36 inches tall, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. Now, we know that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. So, we subtract 2 inches from Anne's height to find Jackie's current height:
   \[
   \text{Jackie's current height} = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. We also know that Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer to reach her current height. To find out how tall she was before the summer, we subtract the 3 inches she grew from her current height:
   \[
   \text{Jackie's height before summer} = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches}
   \]

So, Jackie was 67 inches tall before the summer. The correct answer is 67 inches."
"To find out how much money the company will make from selling chocolate bars in two weeks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the company makes 5000 chocolate bars each day. In one week, which has 7 days, they make:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35000 \text{ bars/week} \]

Now, for two weeks, they will make:
\[ 35000 \text{ bars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Since they sell each bar for $2, the total money they will make is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the company will receive $140000 for selling the chocolate bars in two weeks. The correct answer is 140000."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the T-shirts and shoes.

For the T-shirts:
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts, so he gets the second one at 50% off.
- The first T-shirt costs $8.
- The second T-shirt at 50% off costs $8 * 0.5 = $4.
- So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

For the shoes:
- The original price of the shoes is $40.
- The shoes are 40% off, so Jake pays 60% of the original price.
- The discounted price of the shoes is $40 * 0.6 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:
- Total cost = Cost of T-shirts + Cost of shoes = $12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Ryan earns $6 for each week he does his chores. If he does his chores for 3 weeks, he earns:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, Ryan buys ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so for 4 people, the total cost is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the ice cream cones, Ryan has:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ryan wants to buy movie tickets. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the money he has by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[ \frac{13}{6.5} = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Lani and Ellen.

Ellen bought:
- Leggings for $100
- A photo frame for $5

So, Ellen spent a total of $100 + $5 = $105.

Lani bought:
- Sunglasses for $30
- Two bathrobes, each costing $100, so 2 * $100 = $200

So, Lani spent a total of $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, to find out how much they spent in all, we add what Ellen spent to what Lani spent:
$105 (Ellen's total) + $230 (Lani's total) = $335.

So, the total amount they spent together is $335."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to make one jar of the mix. Here's how we do it:

1. **Passion fruit**: 2 pounds at $6 per pound
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Jackfruit**: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound
   \[
   1.5 \times 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Special honey**: 2 pounds at $10 per pound
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we add up the cost of all the ingredients for one jar:
\[
12 + 12 + 20 = 44 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, it costs $44 to make one jar of the mix. If Tim sells 10 jars, the total cost for 10 jars is:
\[
44 \times 10 = 440 \text{ dollars}
\]

Tim sells each jar for $50. So, the total money he makes from selling 10 jars is:
\[
50 \times 10 = 500 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total money made:
\[
500 - 440 = 60 \text{ dollars}

"To find the total amount of money in the jar, we need to add up the value of all the coins Justin has. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Quarters:**
   - Justin has 32 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - So, the total value of the quarters is \(32 \times 0.25 = 8\) dollars.

2. **Dimes:**
   - Justin has 95 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - So, the total value of the dimes is \(95 \times 0.10 = 9.50\) dollars.

3. **Nickels:**
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - So, the total value of the nickels is \(120 \times 0.05 = 6\) dollars.

4. **Pennies:**
   - Justin has 750 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - So, the total value of the pennies is \(750 \times 0.01 = 7.50\) dollars.

Now, we add up all these values:
\[8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31\]

So, the total amount of money in the jar is \(\boxed{31}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Janet spent money on three things:
1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets: $7.50 each for herself and her sister, so that's $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
3. A bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add up all the money she spent:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from $40:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Josh works at a car shop and he can work on 3 cars each day. He doesn't work on Sunday and Wednesday, so he works on 5 days a week. If he works on 3 cars each day, then in one week he can work on:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

He gets paid $4 for each car he services. So, in one week, he makes:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks. So, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks. The final answer is:

"Okay, let's go through this step by step like I'm explaining it to a middle school student.

Randy starts with:
- 9 oatmeal cookies
- 4 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 sugar cookies

First, he eats 1 oatmeal, 1 chocolate chip, and 1 sugar cookie for his snack. So now he has:
- 9 - 1 = 8 oatmeal cookies
- 4 - 1 = 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 5 - 1 = 4 sugar cookies

Next, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch. So now he has:
- 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 sugar cookies

Then, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So now he has:
- 6 oatmeal cookies
- 3 chocolate chip cookies
- 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies

Finally, he bakes 4 more of each type of cookie for dinner. So now he has:
- 6 + 4 = 10 oatmeal cookies
- 3 + 4 = 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 2 + 4 = 6 sugar cookies

Adding them all up, he has:
- 10 oatmeal cookies
- 7 chocolate chip cookies
- 6 sugar cookies

So, the total number of cookies is 10 + 7 + 6 = 23.

First, we find out how many soldiers are in each half:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
So, there are 6 soldiers at $5 each and 6 soldiers at $7 each.

Now, let's calculate the money he gets from the first half:
\[ 6 \text{ soldiers} \times \$5 = \$30 \]

Next, let's calculate the money he gets from the second half:
\[ 6 \text{ soldiers} \times \$7 = \$42 \]

Now, we add the money from both halves to find the total:
\[ \$30 + \$42 = \$72 \]

So, Matthew would earn \$72. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{72}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. First, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day, and Nate is on vacation for 14 days. So, the total number of holes dug is:
   \[
   6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. When Nate comes back, he starts filling holes, but the dog keeps digging new ones. Nate fills 9 holes a day, and the dog digs 6 holes a day. So, the net change in the number of holes each day is:
   \[
   9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day}
   \]

3. Now, we need to find out how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes. Since the dog and Nate together fill 3 holes each day, we divide the total number of holes by the net change per day:
   \[
   \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}
   \]

4. Finally, we need to convert the number of days into weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of days by 7:
   \[
   \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}
   \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Norman High School has an average of 4000 students. Butler High School has 3/4 as many students as Norman High School. So, we need to find out how many students Butler High School has.

To find out how many students Butler High School has, we do:
\[ \text{Students at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3 \times 1000 = 3000 \]

So, Butler High School has 3000 students.

Now, to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we subtract the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School:
\[ 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1000} \]"
"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

The total number of cookies made is 7995. They have 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies.

First, we add the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies:
\[ 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies to find the number of chocolate chip cookies:
\[ 7995 - 5670 = 2325 \]

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to get:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

Igor got:
- Half as many test tubes as asked, so he got \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Two more Petri dishes than asked, so he got \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- The same number of beakers as asked, so he got 7 beakers.

Now, let's add up all the items Igor got:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

So, the total number of items Igor got is \( 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \).

Dr. Grumpus asked for:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

So, the total number of items Dr. Grumpus asked for is \( 16 + 7 + 14 = 37 \).

Since Igor got 31 items and Dr. Grumpus asked for 37 items, Igor must have lost \( 37 - 31 = 6 \) items.

Now, we need to figure out how many of those 6 lost items were beakers. Since Igor got 7 beakers and lost a total of 6 items, he must have lost 1 beaker.

So, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

James is making 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs. So, for 4 tables, he needs:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 16 \text{ legs} \]

Each leg needs 2 screws, so for 16 legs, he needs:
\[ 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left, we subtract the screws he needs from the screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, James will have 8 screws left over. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first basket, so we calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, to find out how many eggs are in both baskets together, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:

\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up all the amounts:
\[
430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total amount of money they raised is $2180."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Aaron ran 4 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can figure out how fast Vanessa runs.

If Aaron runs 4 miles in 16 minutes, then his speed is:
\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2 \times 4 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles at her speed. Since her speed is 1 mile in 8 minutes, for 4 miles it would be:
\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = 4 \times 8 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Right now, there are 200 feet of dock, so he needs:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

But he already has 6 feet of new line. So, the line he still needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet} - 6 \text{ feet} = 594 \text{ feet} \]

So, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{594} \]"
"Okay, let's break this down step by step in a simpler way.

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations each night. They order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine for each reservation. We need to find out how much they make in a week if they are open 2 days a week.

First, let's find out how much one reservation costs:
- 2 meals at $5 each cost $5.
- A bottle of wine costs $5.
- So, one reservation costs $5 + $5 = $10.

Now, we know they get 6 reservations each night. So, for one night, the cost is:
- 6 reservations * $10 per reservation = $60.

Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we multiply the cost for one night by 2:
- $60 * 2 = $120.

So, the total amount they make in a week is $120.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold them all at a 25% profit. To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we first need to calculate the total selling price.

The cost price of the watermelons is $80. A 25% profit means he made an extra 25% of $80 from selling them. So, we calculate the profit:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the total selling price is:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Now, to find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know James is 18 years old now because he is twice as old as his sister Dora, and Dora will be 12 in 3 years, so Dora is 9 years old now.
2. Since James is 18 and he is 19 years older than his father John, John must be 18 - 19 = -1 years old. But we know John was 19 when James was born, so John is actually 18 + 19 = 37 years old now.
3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is 37 - 32 = 5 years old now.
4. In 3 years, the youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

So, the youngest son will be 8 years old in 3 years. The answer is 8."
"To figure out how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we need to calculate how many oranges each can peel in that time.

First, let's see how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Now, let's find out how many oranges each can peel in 60 minutes (which is an hour):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

To find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges Jane peeled from the number Ana peeled:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The original cost of a new radiator is $400.
2. Mark gets it at 80% off. So, he only pays 20% of $400.
3. To find 20% of $400, we calculate:
   \[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]
   So, the radiator costs $80.
4. Now, Mark hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours.
5. The cost for the mechanic is:
   \[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]
6. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic:
   \[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is $230. 

The correct answer is: **$230**"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know there are 20 animals in total, and they have 70 legs altogether. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each.

First, let's think about how many legs we would have if all 20 animals were chickens. If all 20 animals were chickens, they would have:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ legs} \]

But we know they actually have 70 legs, which is 30 more legs than if all were chickens. Since each cow has 2 more legs than a chicken, we can figure out how many cows there are by dividing the extra legs by 2:
\[ \frac{70 - 40}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ cows} \]

So, there are 15 cows. Now, to find out how many chickens there are, we subtract the number of cows from the total number of animals:
\[ 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ chickens} \]

So, the number of chickens is 5. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. They ordered 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, we first find out how many slices there are in total:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to share these 56 slices equally among the 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
