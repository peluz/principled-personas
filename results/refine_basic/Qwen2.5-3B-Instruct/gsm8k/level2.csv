"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we start by calculating the total number of eggs laid by her ducks each day, which is 16 eggs.

Next, we subtract the eggs she eats for breakfast, which is 3 eggs. This leaves us with:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \text{ eggs} \]

Then, we subtract the eggs she uses to bake muffins, which is 4 eggs. This leaves us with:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Since she sells each of these remaining eggs for $2, the total amount of money she makes every day is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Janet makes every day at the farmers' market is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we start by identifying the quantities of each type of fiber required.

1. **Blue Fiber:**
   - The robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. **White Fiber:**
   - The robe requires half as much white fiber as blue fiber.
   - Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
     \]

3. **Total Bolts of Fiber:**
   - Sum the bolts of blue and white fiber:
     \[
     2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
     \]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"To determine Josh's profit, we start by calculating the total cost of the house after the repairs. Josh initially buys the house for $80,000 and then spends an additional $50,000 on repairs, making the total cost:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

Next, we calculate the increase in value due to the 150% increase. A 150% increase means the value of the house increases by 1.5 times its current value. Therefore, the increase in value is:
\[ 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the original cost gives the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the original cost from the new value:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Thus, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the distance James runs in one sprint:** James runs 60 meters per sprint.
2. **Calculate the distance for one session:** Since he runs 3 sprints each time, the distance for one session is \(60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters}\).
3. **Calculate the total distance for the week:** James runs 3 sessions a week, so the total distance for the week is \(180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}\).

Therefore, the total number of meters James runs in a week is \(\boxed{540}\)."
"To determine the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon:**
   - Morning feed: 15 cups
   - Afternoon feed: 25 cups
   - Total feed for morning and afternoon: \( 15 + 25 = 40 \) cups

2. **Determine the total amount of feed needed for the entire day:**
   - Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed per day.
   - She has 20 chickens.
   - Total feed for the day: \( 3 \text{ cups/chicken} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 60 \text{ cups} \)

3. **Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal:**
   - Total feed for the day: 60 cups
   - Feed given in the morning and afternoon: 40 cups
   - Feed needed for the final meal: \( 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups} \)

Thus, the number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day is 20.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's calculate the cost for every second glass:
- The cost of the first glass is $5.
- The cost of the second glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
- The cost of the third glass is $5.
- The cost of the fourth glass is 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
- This pattern continues for every second glass.

For every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can group them into 8 pairs (since 16 divided by 2 is 8).

The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start with the given information:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which means Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which means Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

Adding the number of sheep in each city together gives us the total number of sheep:
\[20 + 80 + 160 = 260\]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we break down the process into segments:

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update and restart:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start downloading the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 120 GB is \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes.

Now, we sum up the time for each part:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update and restart: 20 minutes
- Time for the remaining download: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

The total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance for each segment.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered: \( 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles} \).

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered: \( 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining: \( 4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \).
   - Distance covered: \( 1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles} \).

Now, we sum up the distances covered in each segment to find the total distance from home:
\[ 180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the final distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is:
\[ \boxed{315} \]"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Earnings from regular hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   - Overtime rate = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour.
   - Earnings from overtime = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime.
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460."
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of downloads over the three months.

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The program had 60 downloads in the first month.

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the second month was three times the downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Second month downloads} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% from the second month.
   \[
   \text{Reduction} = 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third month downloads} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we sum the downloads from each month.
   \[

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the lemon tree is $90.
2. **Revenue per Year**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue per year is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year}
   \]
3. **Cost per Year**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit per year is the revenue minus the cost:
\[
\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year}
\]

Since the initial cost of $90 is a one-time expense, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost. We set up the equation:
\[
7.5 \times \text{number of years} = 90
\]

Solving for the number of years:
\[
\text{number of years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had as \( x \).

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
   \]

2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2
   \]

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]
   The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
   \]

4. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{3} = 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}

"To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit, we need to calculate the future value of each item after the respective market increases and then find the difference between the two future values.

1. **Jewelry:**
   - Current value: $5,000
   - Market increase: 2.5%
   - Future value of jewelry = Current value + (Current value * Market increase)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + ($5,000 * 0.025)
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,000 + $125
   - Future value of jewelry = $5,125

2. **Electronic Gadgets:**
   - Current value: $8,000
   - Market increase: 1.2%
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = Current value + (Current value * Market increase)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + ($8,000 * 0.012)
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,000 + $96
   - Future value of electronic gadgets = $8,096

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit from jewelry = Future value of jewelry - Current value of jewelry
   - Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000
   - Profit from jewelry = $125

   - Profit from electronic gadgets = Future value of electronic gadgets - Current value of electronic gadgets
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = $96

Comparing the profits:
- Profit from jewelry: $125

Each train travels 80 miles westward and 150 miles northward. The total distance covered by each train over the two days is the sum of these two segments.

\[
\text{Total distance} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is \(\boxed{230}\) miles."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we'll break down her earnings from both teaching and coaching.

First, let's calculate her annual earnings from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week as a teacher.
- She gets paid $20 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual teaching hours = 35 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 1750 hours/year
Annual teaching earnings = 1750 hours/year * $20/hour = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate her annual earnings from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week as a coach.
- She gets paid $30 per hour.
- She works 50 weeks a year.

Annual coaching hours = 15 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 750 hours/year
Annual coaching earnings = 750 hours/year * $30/hour = $22,500/year

Now, we sum up her annual earnings from both teaching and coaching:
Annual salary = Annual teaching earnings + Annual coaching earnings
Annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

Therefore, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we follow these steps:

1. **Daily Egg Consumption**: Claire uses 3 eggs per day.
2. **Weekly Egg Consumption**: There are 7 days in a week, so she uses \(3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}\).
3. **Total Egg Consumption in 4 Weeks**: Over 4 weeks, she uses \(21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}\).
4. **Conversion to Dozens**: Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, the total number of dozens is \(\frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen}\).

Therefore, the number of dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To determine the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Marissa wants to spend hiking:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time
   - Given average speed = 4 miles per hour
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Total time = Total distance / Average speed = 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours

2. **Calculate the time already spent hiking:**
   - Time for the first 4 miles = 1 hour
   - Time for the next 2 miles = 1 hour
   - Total time already spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

3. **Calculate the remaining time:**
   - Total time desired = 3 hours
   - Time already spent = 2 hours
   - Remaining time = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour

4. **Calculate the remaining distance:**
   - Total distance = 12 miles
   - Distance already covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

5. **Determine the required speed for the remaining distance:**
   - Remaining distance = 6 miles
   - Remaining time = 1 hour
   - Required speed = Remaining distance / Remaining time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour

Thus, Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

"To determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters after the spill, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, calculate the amount of water in the 10 liters of orange drink:
- The orange drink is two-thirds water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the orange drink is:
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
  \]

Next, calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink:
- The pineapple drink is three-fifths water.
- Therefore, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is:
  \[
  \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
  \]

Now, add the amounts of water from both drinks:
\[
\frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

After spilling one liter of the orange drink, the total volume of the mixture becomes:
\[
10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

The total amount of water remains the same, which is:
\[
\frac{47}{3} \text{ liters}
\]

To find the concentration of water in the remaining 9 liters, we use the total amount of water:
\[
\text{Concentration of water} = \frac{\frac{47}{3}}{9} = \frac{47}{27} \approx 1.74 \text{ liters per liter}
\]

Thus, the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters is:
\[
9 \times \frac{47}{27} = \frac{423}{27} = 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[
\boxed{15.67}

"To determine the original price of the book, we start with the information that Kyle bought the book for $19.50 after receiving a 25% discount. This means that $19.50 represents 75% of the original price. Let's denote the original price by \( P \).

Given that 75% of the original price is $19.50, we can write the equation as:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Performing the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.00."
"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we start by calculating the total cost of the items she has already purchased:

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives:
\[
12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

Marie paid a total of $50. Therefore, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[
50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[
\frac{17}{8.50} = 2
\]

Thus, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To determine the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each type of clothing and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = 3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $59.50.

2. **Cost of pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = 3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50.

3. **Cost of shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - Each pair of shoes costs $42.
   - Total cost for shoes = 3 pairs * $42/pair = $126.00.

Now, we sum up the total costs for all the items:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00

Adding these amounts:
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

Thus, Mishka spent a total of $253.00 on all the clothing items.

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.
2. Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.
3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we can break down the trip as follows:

1. The total distance of the trip is 60 miles.
2. His first stop was at 20 miles.
3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, which means it was at 60 - 15 = 45 miles.

The distance traveled between the first and second stops is the difference between these two points: 45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles.

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 25 miles.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"To determine the cost of the boots, we start by defining the cost of the boots as \( B \). We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which is $66. Therefore, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is:

\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Solving for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their total age is 162, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

With \(x = 9\), we can determine their ages:
- Darrell's age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we start by calculating each friend's guess based on the first friend's guess of 80 jelly beans.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of 80, which is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \), and adding 20 gives \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than 80, which is \( 80 + (0.25 \times 80) = 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Now, we sum these guesses: \( 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \). To find the average, we divide this sum by the number of guesses, which is 3:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Therefore, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we start by calculating the daily time spent. Each dog requires 0.5 hours a day, and John takes care of 10 dogs. Therefore, the total time spent per day is:

\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out the total time spent in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily time by 7:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Thus, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is:

\[
\boxed{35}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given information: Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, with 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( G = S + 30 \)
2. \( G + S = 110 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (S + 30) + S = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
\[ 2S = 80 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 40 \) back into the first equation to find \( G \):
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"To determine the number of jewels Siobhan has, we start by defining the number of jewels Raymond has. According to the problem, Raymond has 40 jewels.

Next, we calculate the number of jewels Aaron has. The problem states that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Therefore, we first find half of Raymond's jewels:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
20 + 5 = 25
\]

Now, we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:

\[
25 - 2 = 23
\]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"To find the total points Mike scored, we'll break down the problem into two segments based on the time and points scored in each segment.

1. **First 20 minutes:**
   - Mike scores 4 points.

2. **Second 20 minutes:**
   - He scores 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.
   - To calculate 25% of 4 points:
     \[
     0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point}
     \]
   - Therefore, the points scored in the second 20 minutes are:
     \[
     4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total points:**
   - Summing the points from both segments:
     \[
     4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points}
     \]

Thus, the total number of points Mike scored is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   \[
   \text{Total yogurts in 30 days} = 2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts}
   \]

2. **Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:**
   The yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{60 \, \text{yogurts}}{4 \, \text{yogurts/set}} = 15 \, \text{sets}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 15 sets:**
   Each set costs $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15 \, \text{sets} \times 5 \, \text{\$/set} = 75 \, \text{\$}
   \]

Therefore, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"To determine how many lego sets John still has, we start by calculating the total amount of money he makes from selling his lego sets. John has 13 lego sets, and he sells each for $15.

\[
13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the 8 video games he buys, with each game costing $20.

\[
8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. This means the amount of money he has left after the purchases is $5. We can verify this by subtracting the cost of the video games from the total money he made from selling the lego sets.

\[
195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since John has $5 left, the $35 he has left is the amount he had initially, which is the total amount he made from selling his lego sets. Given that he started with 13 lego sets and sold all of them, he still has 0 lego sets.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To determine John's running speed, we start by calculating the distance he runs each day. Given that he runs a total of 60 miles in a week and runs 3 days a week, the distance he runs each day is:

\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he runs each of the other two days. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the time he runs on the other two days is:

\[ \text{Time on other two days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time John spends running in a week:

\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find his running speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Therefore, John's running speed is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distances Dana can travel by running and walking, given her speeds and the time spent on each activity.

First, we find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour and this is half of her running speed, her running speed is:
\[ \text{Running speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the time spent on running and walking. Given that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, and the total time is six hours:
\[ \text{Time spent running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time spent walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the distance she can travel by running and walking:
\[ \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time spent running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time spent walking} \]

Since the problem does not provide the walking speed directly, we know it is one-fourth of her running speed:
\[ \text{Walking speed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now we calculate the distance she can travel by walking:
\[ \text{Distance walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances she travels by running and walking:
\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"

3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.

First, calculate the age of Ben's iPhone:
\[
\text{Ben's iPhone age} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone age} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
\]

Next, calculate the age of Brandon's iPhone:
\[
\text{Brandon's iPhone age} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone age} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
\]

Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we follow these steps:

1. Identify the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone: 400 feet.
2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone, which is three times the distance without the gemstone: \(400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet}\).
3. Subtract the dragon's reach from the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone to find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand: \(1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}\).

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 200 \text{ feet} \]

The correct option in multiple-choice format would be:

"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, making a total of 40 pieces. After the guests had their servings, there were 14 pieces remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26."
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat, we start by calculating the calories per serving. Given that a 300g bag contains 5 servings and each serving has 250 calories, the calories per serving are:

\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 50 \text{ calories per serving} \]

Next, we find out how many calories you can still consume in a day. Your daily target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories, so the remaining calories are:

\[ \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

To find out how many servings you can eat with the remaining 200 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

\[ \text{Servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams of chips you can eat are:

\[ \text{Grams} = 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the number of grams of chips you can eat is:

\[ 200 \text{ grams} \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we start by calculating the total cost of making 20 candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 2 pounds of beeswax will make 20 candles. The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00, so for 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles at $2.00 each:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of articles written each day:**
   - **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
   - **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

2. **Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:**
   \[
   \text{Total articles} = 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles:**
   Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent is:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 26 \times 4 = 104

"To determine the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased, we start with the information given:

1. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.
2. She used 220 Post-it notes to place on different cups of coffee.
3. After using these, she had 23 Post-it notes remaining.

Let \( x \) represent the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. The equation representing the total number of Post-it notes she had initially minus the number she used plus the number she had left is:

\[ 80 - 220 + x = 23 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ -140 + x = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \( \boxed{163} \)."
"To determine the total amount John spent on ties, we start by calculating the number of blue ties he bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we find:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of a blue tie. Given that each blue tie costs $40, the cost of each red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

The total cost of the red ties is then:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Adding the total cost of the blue ties and the red ties gives us the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\)."
"To determine how many 6-inch pieces Tracy can obtain from a 4-foot wire, we first convert the total length of the wire from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we calculate:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces she can obtain:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

Therefore, the number of pieces Tracy obtained is \(\boxed{8}\)."

2. **Determine the number of occupied units:**
   - 3/4 of the building is occupied.
   - The number of occupied units is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \) units.

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units:**
   - Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.
   - The number of unoccupied units is \( 120 - 90 = 30 \) units.

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is **30**."
"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day:**
   \[
   \text{Eggs per day} = 252

   \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes \(\boxed{294}\) dollars on eggs per week."
"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to consider the distance \( D \) he travels to his destination. The time taken to travel distance \( D \) at 10 mph is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time to travel to the destination} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

After reaching the destination, Tom travels back at a rate of 6 mph. The time taken to travel back the same distance \( D \) at 6 mph is:

\[ \text{Time to travel back} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

The total time for the round trip is the sum of the time taken to travel to the destination and the time taken to return:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{D}{10} + \frac{D}{6} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 6 is 30. So we rewrite the fractions:

\[ \frac{D}{10} = \frac{3D}{30} \]
\[ \frac{D}{6} = \frac{5D}{30} \]

Adding these fractions gives:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{3D}{30} + \frac{5D}{30} = \frac{8D}{30} = \frac{4D}{15} \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the time it takes Tom to get back, in terms of the distance \( D \), is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{4D}{15}} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total weight of the comic books Uriah removes. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"To determine which day the mechanic earned more revenue, we'll calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday.

**Thursday:**
- Revenue from truck tires: \(6 \text{ tires} \times \$60 \text{ per tire} = \$360\)
- Revenue from car tires: \(4 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$160\)
- Total revenue on Thursday: \(\$360 + \$160 = \$520\)

**Friday:**
- Revenue from car tires: \(12 \text{ tires} \times \$40 \text{ per tire} = \$480\)
- Total revenue on Friday: \(\$480\)

Comparing the two days:
- Thursday's revenue: \$520
- Friday's revenue: \$480

The difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday is:
\[ \$520 - \$480 = \$40 \]

Therefore, the mechanic earned \$40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The final answer is:

"To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to sum the number of adopted kittens and the kittens from both Patchy and Trixie.

1. **Patchy's Kittens:**
   - Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
   - The adopted kittens are 7.
   - Therefore, Patchy has had \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) kittens.

2. **Trixie's Kittens:**
   - Trixie has had 12 kittens.

3. **Total Kittens:**
   - Add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens Patchy and Trixie have had.
   - Total kittens = Adopted kittens + Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens
   - Total kittens = 7 + 21 + 12

Now, let's perform the addition:

\[
7 + 21 + 12 = 40
\]

Thus, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is \(\boxed{40}\)."

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we start by calculating the available weight capacity for the boxes. The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds, and the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum weight that can be added to the truck (the weight of the boxes) is:

\[ 5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, can be loaded onto the truck. We do this by dividing the available weight capacity by the weight of one box:

\[ \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{83}

Each of the 6 clusters contains 20 raspberries, so the total from the clusters is:
\[ 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Adding the 67 individual raspberries to the 120 raspberries from the clusters gives:
\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \text{ raspberries} \]

Therefore, the total number of raspberries is:
\[ 187 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of good oranges, we start with the total number of oranges, which is 25. We know that 1 orange is bad and 2 oranges are sour. Additionally, 20% of the oranges are unripe. Let's calculate the number of unripe oranges first.

1. Calculate the number of unripe oranges:
   \[
   \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]

2. Now, we can find the number of good oranges by subtracting the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total:
   \[
   \text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) = 25 - 8 = 17
   \]

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17."
"To determine the total amount Janet paid, we start by calculating the combined cost of the material and the construction:

Cost of material = $500
Cost of construction = $800

Total cost before insurance = Cost of material + Cost of construction
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800 = $1300

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:

Cost of insurance = 10% of Total cost before insurance
Cost of insurance = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

Adding the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance gives us the final amount Janet paid:

Total amount paid = Total cost before insurance + Cost of insurance
Total amount paid = $1300 + $130 = $1430

Therefore, the final amount Janet paid is $1430."
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to consider the pension structure over the specified period.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Therefore, for the first 20 years, her total pension is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - Therefore, her pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000 per year:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - For the first 20 years, she earns $50,000 per year.
   - For the next 10 years, she earns $50,000 per year.
   - Therefore, her total annual pension after 30 years is:
     \[
     50,000 + 50,000 = 100,000 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

Thus, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is \(\boxed{100000}\)."
"To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and sum them up.

1. **First Half of the Year:**
   - There are 6 months in the first half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 140 = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Second Half of the Year:**
   - The second half of the year also has 6 months.
   - The charge for the second half is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - First, find 10% of $140:
     \[
     0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Subtract this 10% from the initial amount to get the reduced charge for the second half:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 126 = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Amount Paid:**
   - Add the costs for the first and second halves of the year:
     \[
     840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:

"To determine how much money Bailey started with, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the amount of money Bailey started with as \( x \).

Bailey receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, so the total amount of money she received from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. Therefore, the equation representing the total amount of money she has is:
\[ x + 40 = 100 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by isolating \( x \):
\[ x = 100 - 40 \]
\[ x = 60 \]

Thus, Bailey started with $60. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To calculate Judy's earnings for the week, we'll break it down into two parts: her earnings from weekdays and her earnings from Saturday.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday, and there are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches in one weekday is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 75 \text{ students/day} \]

The total number of students she teaches in 5 weekdays is:
\[ 75 \text{ students/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 375 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from the weekdays are:
\[ 375 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$5625.00 \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from Saturday:

"To determine the average square footage of each level in Luke's 4-level sandcastle, we first need to establish the square footage for each level based on the given conditions.

Given:
- The top level (Level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **Level 4 (top level):**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = 16
   \]

2. **Level 3:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

3. **Level 2:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]

4. **Level 1:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2
- Level 2: 4
- Level 3: 8
- Level 4: 16

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footages and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Sum of square footages} = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30
\]

\[
\text{Number of levels} = 4

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food required and then convert that into the number of bags.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \).

2. **Determine the remaining days in the first year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days = \( 365 \, \text{days} - 180 \, \text{days} = 185 \, \text{days} \).

3. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:**
   - The puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day for the remaining 185 days.
   - Total dog food for the remaining 185 days = \( 2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups} \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:**
   - Total dog food for the first year = \( 180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups} \).

5. **Determine the number of bags of dog food needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{550 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = 5 \, \text{bags} \).

Thus, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"Given the problem, we start by identifying the amount of laundry Sarah does, which is 400 pounds. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can find the amount of laundry David does by dividing 400 pounds by 4:

\[
\text{Laundry done by David} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we find the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing 400 pounds by 2:

\[
\text{Laundry done by Raymond} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does:

\[
\text{Difference} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

\[

"To determine how much Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each versus buying them in packages of 2 for $1 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- The total cost for 6 packages of 3 flowers is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- The total cost for 9 packages of 2 flowers is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9.00
  \]

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2: $9.00

Vincent saves more money by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2. The amount saved is:
\[
15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00

\]
Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:
\[
4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we add the amount of water the boy received:
\[
8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

Subtracting the total amount of water received by the girls and the boy from the initial amount gives us the amount of water left:
\[
24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the amount of water left is:
\[
\boxed{10}

\[ 3 \text{ bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Next, we know that each rose has 8 thorns. Thus, the total number of thorns is:

\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables. Let \( L \) represent the number of games lost and \( W \) represent the number of games won. According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, which gives us the equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Additionally, the total number of games played is 22, so we have:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Next, we isolate \( L \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Then, we solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost, we can find the number of games won by substituting \( L \) back into the equation \( W = L + 8 \):
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games won is 15. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad needed for both the adults and the children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"To determine the total number of pets the three individuals have, we start by defining the number of pets each person has in terms of Cindy's pets.

1. Let \( C \) represent the number of pets Cindy has. Given \( C = 4 \).
2. Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \( M = C + 2 \). Substituting \( C = 4 \), we get \( M = 4 + 2 = 6 \).
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \( J = 3M \). Substituting \( M = 6 \), we get \( J = 3 \times 6 = 18 \).

Now, we sum the number of pets each person has to find the total number of pets:

\[
\text{Total pets} = C + M + J = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
\]

Therefore, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To determine Jackson's age, we start by setting up the relationships given in the problem using algebraic expressions.

1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \).
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \).
3. James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey: \( Jm = 10 \) and \( C = Jm + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \).
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so \( Jm = C - 1 \).

From the information that James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey, we have:
\[ C = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Using the relationship between Amy and Corey:
\[ A = C - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Now, using the relationship between Amy and Jackson:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
Substituting \( A = 9 \):
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Calculate Lee's original speed:**
   Lee's speed \( S_L \) is:
   \[
   S_L = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

3. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   Since Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald's original time \( T_G \) is:
   \[
   T_G = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Calculate Gerald's original speed:**
   Gerald's speed \( S_G \) is:
   \[
   S_G = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

5. **Calculate Gerald's improved speed:**
   With a 10% improvement, Gerald's improved speed \( S_G' \) is:
   \[
   S_G' = 10 \text{ meters/second} + 0.10 \times 10 \text{ meters/second} = 10 \text{ meters/second} + 1 \text{ meter/second} = 11 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

6. **Determine Gerald's improved time:**
   Using his improved speed, Gerald's improved time \( T_G' \) is:
   \[
   T_G' = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 36.36 seconds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36.36}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the given information and translating it into algebraic expressions. We know the number of dogs \( D \) is 60, and the number of cats \( C \) is twice the number of dogs, so \( C = 2D \). Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation for \( C \), we get:
\[ C = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we are told that the number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. Therefore, we can express \( R \) as:
\[ R = D + C - 12 \]
Substituting the values of \( D \) and \( C \) into this equation, we get:
\[ R = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 \]

Now, to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we sum the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

Thus, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \(\boxed{348}\)."
"To determine how many girls are not in the girl scout, we start by calculating the number of girls in the class. Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, the number of girls is:

\[ 200 - \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 200\right) = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we start by noting that Harry slept 9 hours. James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we find the difference in the hours slept by Harry and James:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

3"
"To determine the number of tomatoes Freda used, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original volume of tomatoes is twice the volume of the sauce:
     \[
     \text{Original volume of tomatoes} = 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes per can:**
   - Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.

3. **Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used:**
   - Since the original volume of tomatoes is 64 ounces and each can contains 16 ounces, the number of cans used is:
     \[
     \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

5. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Since 4 cans were used and each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
     \[
     \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. Let's denote the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes as \( x \).

Given:
- In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drove through.
- In the remaining 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through.
- 5 cars took an exit.
- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

The number of cars remaining on the motorway after the traffic jam is:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 \]

Since the remaining cars are the ones that did not drive through the traffic jam, we can set up the equation:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = 5 - x \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = 5 - x \]
\[ 5 = 5 - x \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( x = 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to 80 potted plants. She then receives 18 more potted plants from her favorite plant nursery, increasing her total to 98 potted plants. She plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, which means she will give away 40 potted plants. Subtracting the 40 potted plants she gives away from the initial 98 potted plants, she will remain with 58 potted plants. 

Therefore, the final number of potted plants Mary will remain with is \(\boxed{58}\)."
"To find the total number of doorbell rings pressed by Jerome's friends, we will calculate the number of rings each friend pressed and then sum them up.

1. **First Friend**: Pressed the doorbell 20 times.
   \[
   \text{First friend's doorbell rings} = 20
   \]

2. **Second Friend**: Pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   \[
   \text{Second friend's doorbell rings} = 25
   \]

3. **Fourth Friend**: Pressed the doorbell 60 times.
   \[
   \text{Fourth friend's doorbell rings} = 60
   \]

4. **Third Friend**: Pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70
   \]
   \[
   \text{Third friend's doorbell rings} = 70
   \]

Now, we sum up all the doorbell rings:
\[
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175

"To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day over the remaining 4 days, we start by calculating the total number of pages he needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Adding these together gives:
\[ 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 \text{ pages} \]

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:
\[ 39 - 15 = 24 \text{ pages} \]

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ days}} = 6 \text{ pages per day} \]

Thus, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day for the remaining 4 days. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we'll break down his water consumption by weekdays and weekends.

First, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a single weekday:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks on a single weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ glass of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the total glasses of water consumed on weekdays and weekends to find the total for the entire week:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:
\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we start by noting the rate at which the fog bank covers the city. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover 42 miles.

First, we calculate the time it takes to cover 1 mile:
\[
\text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time to cover 42 miles:
\[
\text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} = 140 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the entire city.

"To solve the problem, we start by determining how many pieces Poppy places on the board. Since she places a quarter of the 1000 pieces:

\[
\text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
\]

After Poppy places her pieces, the remaining pieces are:

\[
1000 - 250 = 750
\]

Next, her mom places a third of the remaining 750 pieces:

\[
\text{Pieces placed by her mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
\]

Subtracting the pieces placed by her mom from the remaining pieces gives us the number of pieces left to be placed:

\[
750 - 250 = 500
\]

Therefore, the number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:

\[
\boxed{500}
\]"

"To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we start by determining the inner dimensions of a single box. Given that the outer dimensions of each box are 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches and the walls are 1 inch thick, we can calculate the inner dimensions as follows:

- The inner length is \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches.
- The inner width is \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches.
- The inner height is \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches.

Next, we calculate the volume of one inner box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is length times width times height:

\[
V_{\text{inner}} = 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Since there are 3 such boxes, the total inner volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is \(\boxed{72}\) cubic inches."
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first calculate the total hours he watched TV from Monday to Friday:

- Wednesday: 30 minutes (0.5 hours)
- Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes (1.5 hours)
- Friday: 2 hours

Summing these up:
\[ 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. The additional time he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Since the additional hour he watched on Wednesday was a 1-hour episode, he did not watch any 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

"To determine the number of cookies Henry intended to bake last year, we start with the equation derived from the problem statement. Henry intended to bake \( x \) cookies, and he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies. After dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. This can be expressed as:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies last year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find the final cost of 10 gallons of gas after applying the cashback, we start by calculating the total cost without any cashback. The cost per gallon is $3.00, so for 10 gallons, the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cashback received. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the total cashback is:

\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

To find the final cost after applying the cashback, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost:

\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

Therefore, the final cost after the cashback rewards is:

\[
\boxed{28.00}
\]"
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we first calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice, the fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long, so the total number of fruit roll-ups she ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

For Marcell, the fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long, so the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by both, we divide the total by 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

Therefore, the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how much water the boat took on, we first need to find out how many 10-foot segments Julia rows in the 64 seconds it takes her to reach the shore. Given that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate her speed in feet per second:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we calculate the total distance she rows in 64 seconds:

\[ \text{Total distance} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \times 64 \text{ seconds} = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Since the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed, we can determine the total amount of water taken on by dividing the total distance by 10 and then multiplying by 2 liters:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and using the given relationships.

1. **Jamal's Phone Capacity**: Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
2. **Brittany's Phone Capacity**: Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, if \( B \) represents the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, we have:
   \[
   1800 = 6B
   \]
   Solving for \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
   \]
3. **Birds in Jamal's Photograph**: Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. Let \( D \) represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. Thus:
   \[
   300 = 50D
   \]
   Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{300}{50} = 6
   \]

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( 6 \).

"To determine Sasha's profit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the leftover lumber she has. She has two types of lumber: 2 x 4 x 10 boards and 4 x 4 x 10 boards.

1. **Cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Sasha has 10 boards.
   - Each board costs $10.
   - Total cost for 10 boards = \( 10 \times \$10 = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Sasha has 5 boards.
   - Each board costs $16.
   - Total cost for 5 boards = \( 5 \times \$16 = \$80 \).

Next, we calculate the total cost of all the leftover lumber:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \]

Since the question does not specify the selling price per board, we assume the selling price is the same as the cost price. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the leftover lumber is also $180.

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$180 - \$180 = \$0 \]

Thus, the profit Sasha makes is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts of the mixture are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Given that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons, we can set up the equation to find out how many parts correspond to 120 teaspoons. Since 20 parts equal 120 teaspoons, each part is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Each part} = \frac{120 \text{ teaspoons}}{20 \text{ parts}} = 6 \text{ teaspoons per part} \]

Since the number of teaspoons of sugar is 7 parts, we calculate the number of teaspoons of sugar as:

\[ \text{Teaspoons of sugar} = 7 \text{ parts} \times 6 \text{ teaspoons per part} = 42 \text{ teaspoons} \]

Therefore, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used is:

\[
\boxed{42}

"To find the number of containers imported on the second day, we start by calculating the initial number of vehicles. There were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles, so the initial number of vehicles is:

\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

Next, we know the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles imported on the second day is:

\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

Thus, the number of containers imported on the second day is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"To find the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we start with the given information:

1. Adrien's initial salary was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary.
3. Lylah's initial salary was 30% less than Adrien's initial salary.
4. Lylah's salary also increased by 40% from her initial salary.

First, calculate Adrien's new salary:
\[ \text{Adrien's new salary} = 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000 \]

Next, determine Lylah's initial salary:
\[ \text{Lylah's initial salary} = 40,000 - 0.3 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 0.7 = 28,000 \]

Then, calculate Lylah's new salary:
\[ \text{Lylah's new salary} = 28,000 + 0.4 \times 28,000 = 28,000 \times 1.4 = 39,200 \]

Finally, find the total salary the two were receiving four years later:
\[ \text{Total salary} = 56,000 + 39,200 = 95,200 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{95200}\)."

- Half the number of oranges Morisette brought: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, we calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:
- Morisette's total: \(5 + 8 = 13\) fruits
- Kael's total: \(10 + 4 = 14\) fruits

Adding these totals together gives:
\[ 13 + 14 = 27 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits they have is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To find the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we'll calculate the hours for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:** Sadie slept 8 hours.
2. **Tuesday:** She slept 2 hours less than Monday, which is \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
3. **Wednesday:** She slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, which is \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
4. **Thursday and Friday:** For these two days, she slept 1 hour more than the total of Tuesday and Wednesday combined. The total for Tuesday and Wednesday is \(6 + 4 = 10\) hours, so for Thursday and Friday, she slept \(10 + 1 = 11\) hours per day.

Now, we sum the hours for each day:
\[8 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 11 \text{ (Thursday)} + 11 \text{ (Friday)} = 40 \text{ hours}\]

Thus, the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week is:

"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we break the problem into two parts based on her running speeds and times.

First, we calculate the distance Rosie covers in the initial 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we find out how much time she has left after the initial 3 hours:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Then, we calculate the distance she covers in the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of letters Jennie stamped:**
   Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

2. **Determine the number of letters that were already stamped:**
   After stamping 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

3. **Calculate the initial number of already-stamped letters:**
   The number of already-stamped letters increased by the number of letters Jennie stamped.
   \[
   \text{Initial number of already-stamped letters} = 30 - 20 = 10
   \]

"To determine the number of spoons Julia originally bought, we start with the equation that represents the total number of spoons she had after all transactions. Let \( x \) be the number of spoons Julia originally bought. The sequence of events can be described by the equation:

\[ x + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + 2 = 12 \]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, Julia originally bought 10 spoons. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total number of patient hours per day:**
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, each patient is seen for \( \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \) hours.
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Total patient hours per day = \( 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the revenue from the patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients.
   - Total revenue from patients = \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost to the hospital:**
   - The doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
   - Total cost to the hospital = \( 200 \times 150 = 30,000 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue from patients - Total cost to the hospital.
   - Profit = \( 40,000 - 30,000 = 10,000 \) dollars.

The hospital's profit from these visits is \(\boxed{10000}\)."
"To find out how many elves are left, we start with the initial number of elves, which is 60.

1. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. Therefore, the number of elves who quit is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, the number of elves remaining after this is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. Therefore, the number of elves remaining after this is:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."

"To determine the total cost of Rory's delivery order, we'll break down the costs step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the subs:
\[ 2 \text{ subs} \times \$7.50 \text{ per sub} = 2 \times 7.50 = \$15.00 \]

Next, calculate the cost of the chips:
\[ 2 \text{ bags of chips} \times \$1.50 \text{ per bag} = 2 \times 1.50 = \$3.00 \]

Then, calculate the cost of the cookies:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies} \times \$1.00 \text{ per cookie} = 2 \times 1.00 = \$2.00 \]

Now, add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
\[ \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00 \]

Next, add a 20% delivery fee to the subtotal. Calculate 20% of \$20.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 20.00 = 0.20 \times 20.00 = \$4.00 \]

Add the delivery fee to the subtotal:
\[ \$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00 \]

"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we start with the total number of cars, which is 20. We know there are 12 automatic cars and 4 manual cars. The number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is \( 20\% \)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

Given the relationships:
1. \( W = 2B \)
2. \( B = 2Q \)

And the total number of bees:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \):
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

"To find the total cost including tax, we first calculate the tax on the nonfood items (light bulbs and roach traps). The tax rate is 10%.

- Tax on light bulbs: \(3 \times 0.10 = 0.30\) dollars
- Tax on roach traps: \(4 \times 0.10 = 0.40\) dollars

Adding the tax to the original costs of the nonfood items:

- Total cost of light bulbs including tax: \(3 + 0.30 = 3.30\) dollars
- Total cost of roach traps including tax: \(4 + 0.40 = 4.40\) dollars

The costs of the food items (milk, eggs, and cups) are not taxed:

- Cost of milk: $2
- Cost of eggs: $3
- Cost of cups: $3

Now, we sum up all the costs:

- Total cost of milk: $2
- Total cost of eggs: $3
- Total cost of cups: $3
- Total cost of light bulbs including tax: $3.30
- Total cost of roach traps including tax: $4.40

"To determine the profit Kim will make each week, we first calculate the total number of clients he will have. He currently has 3 clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, making a total of 8 clients.

Next, we calculate the total cost for the bleach and cloths for all clients:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- The cost of one bottle of bleach is $2.
- The cost of one pack of cloths is $5.

Total cost for bleach for 8 clients:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles/client} \times \$2/\text{bottle} = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = \$32 \]

Total cost for cloths for 8 clients:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack/client} \times \$5/\text{pack} = 8 \times 1 \times 5 = \$40 \]

Total expenses for all clients:
\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is given as $92.

Now, we calculate the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

Thus, the profit Kim will make each week is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we start by calculating the number of harvests he can have in a year. Since he harvests every 3 months and there are 12 months in a year, the number of harvests per year is:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Next, we know that John can harvest 100 pineapples per hectare every 3 months. Therefore, in a year, he can harvest:

\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \]

Since John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, the total number of pineapples he can harvest in a year is:

\[ 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 4000 \]"

Therefore, the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up is 2125."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return, which is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]

4. **Bee population at the end of the first 12 hours:**
   Initially, there were no bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, and 15 bees returned, the net change is:
   \[
   0 - 30 + 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   So, at the end of the first 12 hours, there are:
   \[
   0 - 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   This means there are 15 bees that left but haven't returned yet.

5. **Bee population at the end of the day:**
   In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return to the hive. The number of bees that left in the first 12 hours is 60, and all of them return in the last 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is:
   \[
   60 \text{ bees}

"To determine the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to consider the cost of the tickets and the change received.

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and the cost of a child ticket is $10. Therefore, the total cost for one adult and one child ticket is:
\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the amount of money she gave the cashier is the total cost of the tickets plus the change she received:
\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine the number of Facebook friends James has, we start by finding out how many friends Dorothy has. Given that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Solving for Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Next, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we calculate James's friends as follows:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 16 \]"
"To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we first need to convert the distances from miles to feet. Given that there are 5280 feet in a mile:

- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time each person takes to travel their respective distances:

- Time for Steve to bike home: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim to skateboard home: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their travel times is:

\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one bicycle: \(2 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 50 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 5 bicycles: \(5 \times 50 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents}\).

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one tricycle: \(3 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 75 \text{ cents}\).

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one unicycle: \(1 \text{ tire} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 25 \text{ cents}\).

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the tires:
\[
250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[
500 \text{ cents} = 5 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the initial number of french fries in the pack, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. After the seagull, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
5. After the pigeons, the remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
6. A raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) \) fries.
7. After the raccoon, the remaining fries are \( x - 30 - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \).
8. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
9. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6 \implies x - 30 = 18 \implies x = 48
   \]

Thus, the initial number of french fries in the pack was \( 48 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we will calculate the hours for each type of day and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, let's calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Finally, we sum the hours from both types of days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we first convert all lengths to the same unit. We'll use inches for this calculation since the lengths of the croissants and baguettes are given in inches, and the rolls are given in inches as well.

1. **Calculate the total length of the rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Total length of the rolls = \( 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \).

2. **Calculate the total length of the croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Total length of the croissants = \( 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \).

3. **Calculate the total length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is \( 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \).
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of the baguettes = \( 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \).

4. **Calculate the total length of all the baked goods:**
   - Total length = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes
   - Total length = \( 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \).

5. **Convert the total length from inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Total length in feet = \( \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \).

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is \( 280 \) feet.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{280}

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we first calculate the monthly consumption for each type of ape and then sum these amounts for the 2-month period.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monthly consumption: 200 bananas
   - For 2 months: \(200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas}\)

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Monthly consumption: 400 bananas
   - For 2 months: \(400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas}\)

3. **Baboons:**
   - Monthly consumption: 100 bananas
   - For 2 months: \(100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas}\)

Now, we sum the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over the 2 months:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how much farther Blake runs compared to Kelly, we first calculate the distance each person runs.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distance run by Blake and Kelly:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly). The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"

"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. When 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, the total number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6. Then, when 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, the total number decreases by 2. Therefore, the calculation is:

\[ 11 + 6 - 2 = 15 \]

Thus, the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we start with the depth on Monday, which is 17 feet. On Tuesday, the depth increases by 7 feet, making the depth 24 feet. On Wednesday, the depth is two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday. Therefore, we calculate the depth on Wednesday as follows:

\[
\text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we start by calculating the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the given information:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Next, we sum up the total number of each type of fish caught by both:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these totals together gives us the total number of fish caught:

\[
15 + 9 + 8 = 32

Therefore, the total number of fish they were able to catch is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( P_0 = \$20 \)
   - Rate of increase: 20% every two months

2. **Calculate the price increase per two months:**
   - Increase per two months: \( 20\% \) of \( \$20 \)
   - Increase per two months: \( 0.20 \times 20 = \$4 \)

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Number of two-month periods in 36 months: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

4. **Calculate the total increase over 36 months:**
   - Total increase: \( 18 \times \$4 = \$72 \)

5. **Calculate the new price after 36 months:**
   - New price: \( P_0 + \text{Total increase} \)
   - New price: \( 20 + 72 = \$92 \)

Thus, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is \(\boxed{92}\)."
"To find the total value of all the toys, we start by determining the cost of each type of toy based on the given information.

"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the missed income from doing freelance work and then compare it to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie will lose 3 hours of freelance work if she does her taxes herself. Since she earns $35 per hour from freelance work, the missed income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

The accountant charges $90. Therefore, the difference between the missed income and the cost of hiring the accountant is:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

This means Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant. Thus, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{-15} \]"

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( B \) represent Brooke's current age.
- Let \( S \) represent Seth's current age.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, we simplify the second equation:
\[
S + B + 4 = 28
\]
\[
S + B = 24
\]

Next, we substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the simplified second equation:
\[
2B + B = 24
\]
\[
3B = 24
\]
\[
B = 8
\]

Now, we find Seth's current age using \( S = 2B \):
\[
S = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

   \text{Cost of the hat} = \$25
   \]

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
   \]

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.
   \[
   \text{Average cost of the hat and jacket} = \frac{\$25 + \$75}{2} = \frac{\$100}{2} = \$50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the pants} = \$50
   \]

4. **Total cost of each uniform:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket} + \text{Cost of the pants}

"Given the information:

1. Sally Thirtytwo (S3) is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four (S4) is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so S4 is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red (G) is two times as old as Sally Four, so G is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two (S2) is three years older than Granny Red, so S2 is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

The total age of the four birds is the sum of the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and the Caboose. Assuming the Caboose is also 8 years old, the total age is:

\[
\text{Total age} = S2 + G + S4 + \text{Caboose} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51
\]

Thus, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payments:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payments and add it to the minimum monthly payments.

50% of $1000 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, 50% more than the minimum monthly payments is:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month} \]

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 (the number of months in a year):

"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel, which is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the donation to charity, which is half of the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

Given:
- Zaid's monthly salary: $6000
- Rent: \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary
- Car fuel: \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary
- Donation to charity: half of the remaining amount after rent and car fuel
- Amount given to daughter: $200
- Amount given to wife: $700

First, calculate the amount spent on rent:
\[
\text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500
\]

Next, calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
\[
\text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
\]

Now, determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500
\]

Calculate the donation to charity, which is half of the remaining amount:
\[
\text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we start with the total number of votes cast, which is 80. The winner received \(\frac{3}{4}\) of these votes. Let's calculate the number of votes the winner received first.

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total votes minus the votes received by the winner:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser received is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine the number of red roses Sandra ordered, we start by defining the number of white carnations as \( w \). According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \). Additionally, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so we have the equation \( 5w = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( w \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

With \( w \) known to be 40, we can now find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, the number of red roses that Fred must deliver by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business is 160.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Jean's current age, we start with the information given:

1. **Jan's current age is 30.**
2. **Two years ago, Mark's age was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.**
   - Two years ago, Jan's age was \(30 - 2 = 28\).
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago was \(\frac{28}{2} = 14\).
   - Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \(14 + 5 = 19\).
3. **Mark's current age is \(19 + 2 = 21\).**
4. **Jean is two years older than Mark.**
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \(21 + 2 = 23\).

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To determine the winning margin between the two teams, we first calculate the total time each team takes to complete the relay race.

### Team 1 (Very Well-Rounded Team)
Each member of Team 1 runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time taken by Team 1 is:
\[
55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team)
The first runner of Team 2 takes 60 seconds to run their 400 meters. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for each runner are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time taken by Team 2 is the sum of the times for each runner:
\[
60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Difference in Time
To find out how many seconds the faster team (Team 1) will win by, we subtract the total time taken by Team 1 from the total time taken by Team 2:
\[
222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds}

"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then compare them.

### Step 1: Probability of Rolling a Number Greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Thus, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = P(\text{even number on first roll}) \times P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Difference in Probabilities
We need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This is given by the difference in probabilities divided by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then converted to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) - P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To find how much more likely it is, we divide this difference by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and then convert to a percentage:
\[
\text{Percentage more likely} = \left( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \right) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{100}

"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we start by setting up the equation based on the information provided. Let \( r \) represent the number of rats in each cage. Given that there are 3 cages of rats and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3 \times 6 \times r = 18r \).

We know the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160. This total includes the straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits. The total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) pieces, and the total number of pieces of straw given to the rabbits is 20 pieces. Therefore, the equation for the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is:

\[ 18r = 160 - 50 - 20 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[ 18r = 90 \]

To find \( r \), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[ r = \frac{90}{18} = 5 \]

Thus, the number of rats in each cage is \( 5 \).

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial amount owed**: $100
2. **Monthly interest rate**: 2% or 0.02
3. **Number of months**: 3

First, calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Next, calculate the total interest for 3 months:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, add the total interest to the initial amount owed to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict **$106**.

The correct answer is **$106**."
"To determine the number of bags of wheat sold, we start by setting up the equation based on the given information. The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at $20 per bag, resulting in a purchase cost of \( 20n \) dollars. The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is \( 2n \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost incurred is:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \text{ dollars} \]

The trader sells each bag at $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \text{ dollars} \]

The trader's profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, which is given as $400. Thus, we can write the profit equation as:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

Therefore, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags of wheat."
"To determine how much each friend paid, we first calculate the total expenses. The friends spent $20.25 on tickets and $15.75 on food, making the total cost of tickets and food $36.00. They also spent $66.00 on rides. Adding these together gives the overall total cost:

\[ 20.25 + 15.75 + 66.00 = 102.00 \]

Since the total cost is to be split evenly among the three friends, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{102.00}{3} = 34.00 \]

Therefore, each friend paid $34.00. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"

"To determine the daily amount of insects needed for a flock of ten ducks, we start with the weekly requirement for one duck, which is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we calculate the daily requirement for one duck as follows:

\[ \text{Daily requirement for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Given that there are ten ducks in the flock, we then multiply the daily requirement for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Daily requirement for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we start with the initial number of trees and account for the changes each year.

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees each year**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net increase of \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Number of trees after 10 years without any deaths**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees. Therefore, the total number of trees after 10 years is \(50 + 80 = 130\).
4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. The number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\).
5. **Number of trees left after the deaths**: The number of trees left after the deaths is \(130 - 39 = 91\).

Thus, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"To determine the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday, let's follow the steps methodically:

1. **Initial number of pink flamingos on Friday morning:** 18
2. **On Saturday morning, one third of the flamingos (6 flamingos) were taken back and painted white.** This leaves 12 pink flamingos.
3. **On Sunday morning, 18 more pink flamingos were added.** This brings the total to 30 pink flamingos.
4. **There are 6 white flamingos (the ones that were painted white on Saturday).**

Now, to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:
- Number of pink flamingos: 30
- Number of white flamingos: 6
- Difference: \(30 - 6 = 24\)

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. The final answer is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"To determine the change Violetta will receive, we first calculate the total cost of the crayons. Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has:

\[ 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the change Violetta will get is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we start by calculating the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, their combined cost is:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

Since a pen costs as much as this combined amount, a pen costs $1.50. To find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00."
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we start with the total amount of carrots available, which is 200 pounds. Each of the 40 restaurants is to receive 2 pounds of carrots. Therefore, the total amount of carrots distributed is calculated as follows:

\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Subtracting the amount distributed from the total amount available gives us the amount of carrots that will not be used:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:

\[ \boxed{120} \]"

"To determine the total number of cheese slices Carl used, we will break down the problem into parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich.
   - Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week.

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we start by calculating the sum of her first five test scores:

\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Next, we need the total sum of the six test scores to achieve an average of 93. The formula for the average is:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all scores}}{\text{Number of tests}} \]

For an average of 93 over six tests:

\[ 93 = \frac{\text{Sum of all six scores}}{6} \]

Solving for the sum of all six scores:

\[ \text{Sum of all six scores} = 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

Now, we find the score required on the sixth test by subtracting the sum of the first five test scores from the total sum needed:

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we'll calculate the distances for each period separately and then sum them up.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the first four weeks is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the next three weeks is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**

"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we start by calculating the weight of each type of candy. Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each candied apple weighs half as much, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Joe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams."

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we start by calculating the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20, with 2 pairs needed. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Sara already has $10 saved. The additional amount she needs to earn is:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Sara earns $4 for each time she mows the lawn. Let \( x \) be the number of times she needs to mow the lawn. The equation to find \( x \) is:

\[ 4x = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
- Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

Given the conditions:
1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs per day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs per day.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which translates to \( w = r + 2 \).

The total number of eggs collected per day can be expressed as:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:
\[ r = 4 \]

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we need to determine the time \( t \) it takes Gary to walk this distance at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The formula for time is:

\[ t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]

Here, the distance is 15 miles and the speed is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we start with the information given:

- On the first day, 100 customers entered the store.
- On the second day, 50 more customers entered than on the first day, making it 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
- The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

To find the number of customers on the third day, we subtract the number of customers from the first and second days from the total number of customers over the three days:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the given conditions. Let \( S \) represent the current amount of water in the small pool and \( B \) represent the current amount of water in the big pool.

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

We are also given that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

Now, we have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

Setting these equations equal to each other:
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 4S - 2S \]
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

Therefore, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we start by calculating the total amount she promised to return. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. The additional 10% is calculated as follows:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

Adding this to the original amount, the total amount she promised to return is:

\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months. She is paying $165 per month for 12 months:

\[ 165 \times 12 = 2040 \]

Now, we determine the remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:

\[ 2200 - 2040 = 160 \]

Thus, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we start with the number of roses, which is 4. Given that there are 7 more dahlias than roses, the number of dahlias is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Adding the number of roses and dahlias together gives us the total number of flowers:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we start by calculating their ages in three years based on their current ages.

1. **Harriet's current age is 21 years.**
   - In three years, Harriet's age will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years.

2. **Zack's current age is twice Harriet's current age.**
   - Therefore, Zack's current age is \(2 \times 21 = 42\) years.
   - In three years, Zack's age will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years.

3. **Adrian's current age is three times Harriet's current age.**
   - Therefore, Adrian's current age is \(3 \times 21 = 63\) years.
   - In three years, Adrian's age will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years.

Next, we calculate the average age of the three in three years:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in 3 years} + \text{Zack's age in 3 years} + \text{Adrian's age in 3 years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
\]

Thus, the average age of the three in three years is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we start by calculating the points scored by Yuri and Brianna based on the given information.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Next, we sum the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

Given that the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's score by subtracting the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total points:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

Therefore, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on each type of puzzle and then sum these times.

First, we calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on crossword puzzles} = 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.

\[
\text{Time spent on sudoku puzzles} = 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time spent on both types of puzzles:

\]

Therefore, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is \(\boxed{70}\) minutes."
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. After Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden, the remaining water is:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Celine then collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank, the total amount of water in the tank now is:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the final amount of water in the tank is **90 liters**."
"To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we start by calculating the number of petunias. Given that Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias is:

\[ 90 - 40 = 50 \]

Next, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is:

\[ 140 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 140 \]"
"To find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years, we start by noting the expenditure for the first year is $15000. For the second year, the company spends a third of the first year's amount, which is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Amount spent in the second year} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000
\]

Adding the amounts from both years gives us the total expenditure:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000."
"To find the total cost of the rentals, we first calculate the cost for Carlos and Benji separately.

For Carlos, who rents a canoe for $30 per hour for 3 hours:

Adding the costs together:
\[
90 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars} = 180 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to consider both the trip from New Jersey to Rochester and the return trip from Rochester to New Jersey.

1. **Trip from New Jersey to Rochester:**
   - Andrew takes 6 days by bus.

2. **Return Trip from Rochester to New Jersey:**
   - The return trip is by car, and it takes half as many days as the trip to Rochester.
   - Therefore, the return trip takes \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) days.

3. **Total Travel Days:**
   - The total number of days is the sum of the days for the trip to Rochester and the return trip.
   - Total days = 6 days (to Rochester by bus) + 3 days (return by car) = 9 days.

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 9 days.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type after the changes, we start with the updated counts of each type of card:

- Fire type: 30 cards
- Grass type: 20 cards
- Water type: 40 cards (loses 8, then gains 14)

First, we adjust the number of water type cards:
\[ 40 - 8 + 14 = 46 \text{ water type cards} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of cards:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 20 \text{ (grass)} + 46 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ total cards} \]

Now, we find the percentage of water type cards:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{46}{96} \right) \times 100 \approx 48.08\% \]

Rounded to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:
\[ 48\% \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 48 \]"
"To determine how much Chad still owes, we start by calculating the total cost of his burrito with all the additional items:

- Base burrito: $6.50
- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Next, Chad upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, which includes chips and a drink. Adding this to the previous total:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00 that he uses at checkout. Subtracting the value of the gift card from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

Therefore, the amount Chad still owes is:
\[ 9.00 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we start by calculating their combined rate of placing pieces.

Kalinda places pieces at a rate of 4 pieces per minute, and her mom places pieces at half that rate, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they place:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

To convert the time from minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we start with the total number of watermelons produced, which is 120.

First, we calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the watermelons were ready, we compute:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

This means 36 watermelons were ready and Ashlyn took them home. Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means 63 watermelons were ready for harvest. Consequently, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Thus, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company, with each car selling for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on the cars and then another $1000 for registration on each of them. To find out how much he pays for everything, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   \[
   \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost before registration fees:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total registration cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays is **$276,000**."
"To determine how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday, we start by calculating the number of shells she collected on Monday. Given that Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert, we find:

\[
\text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = 20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Kylie's shells on Tuesday} = 2 \times 25 = 50
\]

Thus, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

"Given that there are 50 ants in the garden and the number of bugs is half the number of ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we start with the total number of penguins, which is 36. 

Next, we calculate the number of penguins that jump into the ocean. Since one-third of the penguins jump in, we perform the calculation as follows:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Then, we calculate the number of penguins that go into the cave. Again, one-third of the penguins go into the cave:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, we add the number of penguins that jump into the ocean and those that go into the cave to find the total number of penguins that leave the snow:
\[
12 + 12 = 24
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of penguins that leave the snow from the total number of penguins to find out how many are still sunbathing:
\[
36 - 24 = 12
\]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we start by calculating the total weekly intake of tomatoes for both Steve and his girlfriend. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half of that, which is 3 tomatoes per day. Therefore, their combined daily intake is:

\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} + 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} = 9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \]

Next, we calculate their combined weekly intake by multiplying their daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total weekly intake by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:

\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we start by calculating the total number of pizza slices required. John has 20 friends, and each friend will have 4 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we know that each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we start with the initial purchase of 25 pens. For every 5 empty pens, Ram can make 1 new pen. 

First, we calculate how many sets of 5 pens are in the initial 25 pens:
\[
\frac{25}{5} = 5
\]
This means Ram can make 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens. Adding these new pens to the initial 25 pens gives us the total number of pens:
\[
25 + 5 = 30
\]
Thus, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Johnny started with an initial sum of $20 and added an extra $10, making his total investment $30. When this sum tripled in a year, the amount of money he had after a year was $30 * 3 = $90.

"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start with the given information:

1. Jessa's age is 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is \(20 + 5 = 25\) years.
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is \(25 - 2 = 23\) years.

Now, we sum their ages:
\[
\text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23
\]

Calculating the sum:
\[
20 + 25 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 23 = 68
\]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:

Initially, there are 1000 students in the hall.

1. **Students exiting through exit A**: 30% of 1000 students.
   \[
   0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students exited through exit A.

2. **Remaining students after exit A**: 
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. **Students exiting through exit B**: \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 700 students.
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students exited through exit B.

4. **Students exiting through exit C**: The rest of the students.
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

The final answer is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"To solve the problem using algebraic reasoning:

"Mike was initially pen pals with 5 people. After stopping being pen pals with 2 of them, he has 3 pen pals left. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 3 pen pals in kind, so he also sends 30 pages a week. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we first convert the total number of pages into minutes:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we convert the total minutes into hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we start by calculating the total minutes he has used. Jason makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day, and there are 30 days in the month. Therefore, the total minutes used for these calls is:

\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Additionally, Jason has used an extra 300 minutes for calls to other people. Adding these together gives the total minutes used:

\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. To find out how many minutes he has left, we subtract the total minutes used from the plan's allowance:

\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's go through the steps methodically:

1. Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. Now Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin. After receiving \(x\) fries from Ginger, Griffin had \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, so Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby took 2 fries, Griffin had \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. According to the problem, in the end Griffin had 27 fries. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.

- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, which is \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, which is \( 2 \times 13 = 26 \) cookies.

Thus, the total number of cookies Sue ate is:
\[ 20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie contains 200 calories. Therefore, we calculate the total calories consumed by each:
- Sue's total calories: \( 46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories} \)
- Sue's sister's total calories: \( 18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories} \)

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract the total calories of her sister from Sue's total calories:
\[ 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories} \]

Therefore, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5600} \]"
"To determine the number of boys in the third class, we start by calculating the total number of students in the school. Given that each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Since the school is evenly split between boys and girls, the number of boys and girls is:

\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

Next, we know the number of girls in the first and second classes:
- First class: 15 girls
- Second class: 12 girls

Let \( G_3 \) be the number of girls in the third class. The total number of girls in the school is the sum of the girls in all three classes:

\[ 15 + 12 + G_3 = 30 \]

Solving for \( G_3 \):

\[ 27 + G_3 = 30 \]
\[ G_3 = 30 - 27 = 3 \]

Since the third class has 20 students and there are 3 girls, the number of boys in the third class is:

\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

Therefore, the number of boys in the third class is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Travis started with 61 apps. After deleting 9 apps, he had:

The final numerical answer is 70."
"To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we start by identifying the number of each type of animal killed each day.

1. **Wolves killed last night:** \( w_1 = 10 \)
2. **Cougars killed last night:** \( c_1 = 15 \)
3. **Wolves killed today:** \( w_2 = 3 \times c_2 \)
4. **Cougars killed today:** \( c_2 = c_1 - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 \)

Next, we calculate the number of wolves killed today:
\[ w_2 = 3 \times c_2 = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

Now, we sum up the total number of animals killed:
- Wolves killed last night: \( 10 \)
- Cougars killed last night: \( 15 \)
- Wolves killed today: \( 36 \)
- Cougars killed today: \( 12 \)

Total number of animals killed:
\[ 10 + 15 + 36 + 12 = 73 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is \( 73 \)."
"Bill starts on the 3rd floor. To determine his final floor, we calculate \(4 \times 3 + 6\).

First, we compute \(3 \times 4\):
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \]

Therefore, Bill is on the 18th floor. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 18 \]"
"To determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, we start with the information that Mitchel went down the slide 30 times. Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, which means Anne went down the slide 70% of the times Mitchel did. We calculate 70% of 30:

\[ 70\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.70 \times 30 = 21 \]
So, Anne went down the slide 21 times.

Next, we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as many times as Anne. Therefore, we multiply the number of times Anne went down the slide by 4:

\[ 4 \times 21 = 84 \]

Thus, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 84 \]"
"Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, totaling 200 cows. Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, making the total number of cows 240. These 40 cows are then evenly distributed among the 20 stalls, with each stall receiving 2 cows. To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we calculate:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 16. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

\[ 1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank is \(\boxed{45.00}\) dollars."
"To find the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten, we start by calculating the total weight of the entire tree. Given that each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds and the tree is 200 feet tall, we can determine the total weight as follows:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we account for the damage caused by the termites, which ate 30% of the wood. This means 70% of the wood remains. We calculate the remaining weight as:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30) = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}
\]"
"To find out how much Nancy has to pay, we start by calculating the cost of the overdue books. She owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books, so the total cost for the books is:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. Adding this to the cost of the books gives:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ \boxed{6.00} \]"
"Given the problem, we start by defining the variables and using the provided relationships to find the number of apples and bananas Jamal has.

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( A_a = J_a + 8 \).
2. Andrea has 52 apples, so \( A_a = 52 \).
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).

From the information that Andrea has 52 apples:
\[ A_a = J_a + 8 = 52 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine the total cups of flour Carla will need, we start by calculating the total number of cookies she is making. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow, so the total number of cookies is:

\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

Next, we know that 2 cups of flour are required to make 12 cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we set up the following proportion:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we start by calculating the number of pennies in the stack. Given there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we find two thirds of this amount:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = 9300 \times \frac{2}{3} = 6200
\]

Next, we convert the number of pennies in the stack to dollars. Since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar, we divide the number of pennies by 100:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = \frac{6200}{100} = 62
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\boxed{62}
\]"
"Maddison initially has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. Therefore, the total number of marbles she has initially is:

\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \text{ marbles} \]

\[ 250 + 20 = 270 \text{ marbles} \]

The final numerical answer is 270."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of trees Ferdinand has. Given that Chris has 6 trees and Ferdinand has half the number of trees Chris has:

\[
\text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we calculate the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees:

\[
\text{Twice the number of trees Ferdinand has} = 2 \times 3 = 6
\]

\[
\text{Number of trees Harry has} = 6 + 5 = 11
\]

To find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:

\[
\text{Difference in the number of trees} = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

Therefore, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To find out how much money all three girls have combined, we start by calculating the individual amounts:

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, which is $100 + $25 = $125.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, which is $125 + $50 = $175.

Now, to find the total amount of money all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts together:
\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is $400."
"To determine how much more the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total price including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Calculate the Brokerage Fee**:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

2. **Calculate the Transfer Fee**:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

3. **Calculate the Total Price Including Fees**:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

4. **Determine the Excess Over the Budget**:
\[ \text{Excess} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

Therefore, the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget by $9,500.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for all expenses and the loan repayment. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   The total expenses include the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale:**
   The net proceeds from the sale of the house is the selling price minus the total expenses.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds from sale} = 400,000 - 32,000 = 368,000
   \]

5. **Subtract the loan repayment:**
   Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = 368,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
   \]

Thus, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is:
\[
\boxed{118000}

"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we need to break down the process step by step.

First, the oil takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees.

Next, it takes 40% longer to heat the oil to 400 degrees. To find 40% of 20 minutes:
\[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]
So, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]

After heating the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil to 400 degrees:
\[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding up all the times:
\[ 20 \text{ (heating to 300 degrees)} + 28 \text{ (heating to 400 degrees)} + 23 \text{ (cooking)} = 71 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:
\[ 71 \text{ minutes} \]"

- The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, which is \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
- The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, which is \(\frac{300}{2} = 150\) M&Ms.

Adding these together:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

Therefore, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"To find the total number of windows in John's two houses, we'll break down the problem into two parts: the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows.

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
     \[
     6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}
     \]

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives:
     \[
     12 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 8 \text{ windows (additional)} = 20 \text{ windows}
     \]

Thus, the total number of windows between the two houses is:
\[

"To determine the change the mother receives, we first calculate the total cost of the items she purchased. The costs are as follows:

- Cocoa: $4.20
- Laundry: $9.45
- Pasta: $1.35

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is:
\[ \boxed{5.00} \]"
"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we start by analyzing the given information:

- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is \( \frac{900}{10} = 90 \) stitches.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is \( 2 \times 90 = 180 \) stitches.
- The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

First, we calculate the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette:
\[
90 \text{ (collar)} + 180 \text{ (rosette)} = 270 \text{ stitches}
\]

Next, we subtract the stitches used for the collar and the rosette from the total number of stitches to find the number of stitches used for the sleeves:
\[
1800 \text{ (total stitches)} - 270 \text{ (collar and rosette)} = 1530 \text{ stitches}
\]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2:
\[
\frac{1530}{2} = 765 \text{ stitches per sleeve}
\]

Thus, each sleeve takes \(\boxed{765}\) stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we start by calculating the total cost for each type of seed separately.

For the tomato seeds:
- She bought 20 packets.
- Each packet costs $40.
- Therefore, the total cost for tomato seeds is \(20 \times 40 = 800\) dollars.

For the celery seeds:
- She bought 80 packets.
- Each packet costs $30.
- Therefore, the total cost for celery seeds is \(80 \times 30 = 2400\) dollars.

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost:
\[800 + 2400 = 3200\] dollars.

Thus, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is \(\boxed{3200}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
     \[
     2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
     \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
     \[
     54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
     \]

4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize:**
   - Lines from the solo song: 54
   - Lines from the first scene: 36
   - Lines from the second scene: 48

Summing these up:
\[
54 + 36 + 48 = 138
\]

Thus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \(\boxed{138}\)."
"To determine how many cards had the letter D on them, we'll follow a step-by-step breakdown using fractions and percentages.

Initially, Carly had 80 cards. 

First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
\]
This leaves us with:
\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]
This leaves us with:
\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C:
\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we start by calculating the time required for each type of hole separately.

First, we calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

\[
\text{Time for small holes} = 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

\[
\text{Time for large holes} = 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time for both types of holes:

\[
\text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"Given that the sum of Mico's and Marco's current ages is 20, we can calculate their ages in 10 years by recognizing that each of their ages will increase by 10 years. Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be the current sum plus 20 years (10 years for Mico and 10 years for Marco).

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years is **40**."
"Let's solve the problem step by step using algebraic methods.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]
2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

First, substitute the expression for \( R \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Next, expand the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to isolate \( S \):
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides to further isolate \( S \):
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 6 \]

Therefore, Sam is currently 6 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of spots a mamba has. Given that a cobra has 70 spots and this is twice the number of spots a mamba has, we calculate the number of spots a mamba has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of spots a mamba has} = \frac{70}{2} = 35
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras and all the mambas. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[
\text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800
\]

There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[
\text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100
\]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[
\text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900
\]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

   - Total cost: \(13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, the total amount Maddy will spend is \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we start by calculating the total length occupied by the topaz gemstones. Given that each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and she uses 8 gemstones per necklace, the total length occupied by the gemstones is:

\[ 8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we subtract the length occupied by the gemstones from the total length of the necklace to find the length available for the sterling silver beads:

\[ 25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches} \]

Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find the number of beads, we divide the available length by the length of one bead:

\[ \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads} \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}

   - Alani: \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories
   - Braylen: \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories
   - Margot: \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories

2. Sum the stories written in the first week:
   - Alani: 20 stories
   - Braylen: 40 stories
   - Margot: 60 stories
   Total for the first week: \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) stories

3. Sum the stories written in the second week:
   - Alani: 40 stories
   - Braylen: 80 stories
   - Margot: 120 stories
   Total for the second week: \(40 + 80 + 120 = 240\) stories

   Total number of stories: \(120 + 240 = 360\) stories

The total number of stories they wrote altogether is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"To determine how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years, we start with Ann's current age, which is 9 years. Since her brother is twice her age, we calculate his current age as follows:

\[
\text{Brother's current age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
\]

Next, we add 3 years to his current age to find out how old he will be in 3 years:

\[
\text{Brother's age in 3 years} = 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ years old}
\]

Therefore, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[
21

"To determine how many cents Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop, we start by calculating the total amount of money she has. Kelly has 5 quarters, and each quarter is worth 25 cents. Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:

\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Next, Kelly has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the value of the quarters and the dimes gives us the total amount of money Kelly has:

\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we subtract the cost of the can of pop, which is 55 cents, from the total amount of money Kelly has:

\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the number of cents Kelly will have left is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine the number of rows of 5 stars on the flag, we start by calculating the total number of stars and then subtract the number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars.

1. The total number of stars on the flag is 76.
2. The number of stars in the rows of 8 stars is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).
3. The number of stars in the rows of 6 stars is \(2 \times 6 = 12\).
4. The total number of stars in the rows of 8 and 6 stars is \(24 + 12 = 36\).
5. The number of stars in the rows of 5 stars is \(76 - 36 = 40\).
6. The number of rows of 5 stars is \(\frac{40}{5} = 8\).

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first calculate the total weight of the flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight for 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trucks are required to carry 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry 2000 pounds. We divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, 3 trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the time the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles, we start with the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed.

Given:
- The car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour.
- The car in the slow lane travels at half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.
- The distance traveled by both cars is 480 miles.

Using the formula for time:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the car in the slow lane:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"Given the problem, we start by defining the variables and using the information provided:

- Ali has \( A = 22 \) medals.
- Izzy has \( I = A - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17 \) medals.
- Together, Ali and Izzy have \( A + I = 22 + 17 = 39 \) medals.

The problem states that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This can be mathematically represented as:
\[ 39 = \frac{T}{10} \]
where \( T \) is the total number of medals given out.

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:
\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"To determine how many chocolate bars each child will get, we start by calculating the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets, each containing 5 chocolate bars:

\[
8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of chocolate bars that the 4 adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars:

\[
4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

Subtracting the chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars leaves us with:

\[
40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

These remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the 8 children. Therefore, each child will get:

\[
\frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child}
\]

Thus, each child will get \(\boxed{2}\) chocolate bars."
"Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. Over a period of 3 hours (180 minutes), she works for 150 minutes (excluding a 30-minute break). To find out how much she earns, we calculate her earnings per minute as follows:

\[ \text{Earnings per minute} = \frac{5 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \text{ dollars/minute} \]

Then, we multiply her earnings per minute by the total minutes she works:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 150 \text{ minutes} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/minute} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns for the online task is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"To determine the total points after the fourth round, we will follow these steps:

1. **Initial Points Calculation:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Fourth Round Points:**
   - Mike does not get an extra point because he has 21 points, which is not over 20.
   - Jim does not get an extra point because he has 18 points, which is not over 20.
   - Tony gets an extra point because he has 42 points, which is over 20.

3. **Total Points After Fourth Round:**
   - Mike's total points: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
   - Jim's total points: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
   - Tony's total points: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

4. **Summing the Total Points:**
   \[
   21 + 18 + 43 = 82
   \]

Thus, the total number of points that all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{82}\)."

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we start by calculating the daily rice consumption for the household. Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 members who eat at lunch and dinner. Therefore, the daily consumption is:

\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:

\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Finally, to find out how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total bag weight by the weekly consumption:

\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first calculate the total crates sold during the week he was open. He was closed on Monday and Friday, so the days he sold bread were Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend.

The crates sold each day are:
- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Adding these together gives:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target for the week was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off by, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine the total amount Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to sum up all her bids. She starts at $200 and increases by $50 each time until she reaches a certain bid that she wins. We need to find out how many bids she made and then sum them up.

Carmen's bids form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 200\) and the common difference \(d = 50\). Let's denote the number of bids she made as \(n\). The \(n\)-th term of the sequence can be expressed as:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]
We need to find \(n\) such that \(a_n\) is the highest bid she makes. Since she wins the desk, the last bid she makes is the highest bid, and we need to find the total sum of these bids.

The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) \]

First, we need to find the highest bid she makes. Let's assume the highest bid she makes is \(a_n\). The last term \(a_n\) can be expressed as:
\[ a_n = 200 + (n-1) \cdot 50 \]

We need to find the value of \(n\) such that the sequence continues until she wins the desk. Since the problem does not specify the exact highest bid, we can infer that the sequence continues until the next person's bid exceeds the highest bid she makes. However, without loss of generality, we can assume the sequence continues until the next person's bid exceeds the highest bid she makes, which is the last term of the sequence.

Let's assume the highest bid she makes is the last term of the sequence. The sum of the sequence can be calculated as:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} (200 + (200 + (n-1) \cdot 50)) = \frac{n}{2} (200 + 200 + 50(n-1)) = \frac{n}{2} (400 + 50(n-1)) = \frac{n}{2} (400 + 50n - 50) = \frac{n}{2} (350 + 50n) = 25n(n + 7) \]

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of bids, we can infer that the sequence continues until the next person's bid exceeds the highest bid she makes. However, without loss of generality, we can assume the sequence continues until the last term of the sequence.

Let's assume the highest bid she makes is the last term of the sequence, which is the 20th term (since the bids increase by $50 each time and she bids after each of the 3 other people, the total number of bids is 20).

The 20th term is:
\[ a_{20} = 200 + (20-1) \cdot 50 = 200 + 19 \cdot 50 = 200 + 950 = 1150 \]

The sum of the sequence is:
\[ S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} (200 + 1150) = 10 \cdot 1350 = 13500 \]

Therefore, the total amount Carmen paid for the antique desk is:
\[ \boxed{13500} \]"
"To determine how much John pays a year for driving, we'll break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance driven in a year:**
   - Distance to work one way: 30 miles
   - Distance for a round trip: \(30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles}\)
   - Number of round trips per week: 5 days
   - Number of weeks per year: 50 weeks
   - Total distance driven in a year: \(60 \text{ miles/round trip} \times 50 \text{ round trips/year} = 3000 \text{ miles/year}\)

2. **Calculate the cost of the miles driven:**
   - Cost per mile: $2
   - Total cost for miles driven: \(3000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 6000 \text{ dollars/year}\)

3. **Calculate the total bonus given to the driver per year:**
   - Bonus per month: $150
   - Number of months per year: 12 months
   - Total bonus per year: \(150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1800 \text{ dollars/year}\)

4. **Calculate the total cost for the year:**
   - Total cost for miles driven: $6000
   - Total bonus per year: $1800
   - Total cost for the year: \(6000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 7800 \text{ dollars}\)

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is \(\boxed{7800}\)."
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we start by calculating the total exercise time from Monday and Sunday combined. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. Therefore, the total time exercised on these two days is:

\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount on Tuesday. Therefore, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:

\[ 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 78 \]"
"To determine the number of pieces of paper needed to create a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the folding process and the printing layout.

1. **Folding Process**: When a piece of paper is folded vertically, it creates two layers. Each layer can be used to print two pages, one on the front and one on the back. This means that each piece of paper can be used to print 4 pages (2 pages on the front and 2 pages on the back).

2. **Pages in a 32-page Tabloid**: A 32-page tabloid has 32 pages. Since each piece of paper can be used to print 4 pages, we need to determine how many pieces of paper are required to print 32 pages.

3. **Calculation**: 
   \[
   \text{Number of pieces of paper} = \frac{\text{Total number of pages}}{\text{Pages per piece of paper}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of pieces of paper needed to create a 32-page tabloid is 8.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To find out how much money Annika has left after her expenses, we start with the initial amount she brought, which is $50. She spends half of this amount on food and snacks:

\[
\text{Amount spent on food and snacks} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

After spending on food and snacks, she has:

\[
50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Then, she spends an additional $10 on rides. Subtracting this from the remaining amount:

\[
25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Annika is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"To determine the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we start by identifying the number of books sold in the second year. Given that she sold 45 books this year, and the price per book is $20, the total amount of money earned in the second year is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total money earned in the second year} = 45 \times 20 = 900 \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{900}\)."
"To determine how much money Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate Watson's daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since Watson gets a $300 bonus each week if the company performs well, we need to add this bonus to his weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings with bonus} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 30 days.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \]

Since Watson earns weekly, we consider only full weeks in April. Therefore, we consider 4 full weeks in April.

\[ \text{Total earnings for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 800 \, \text{\$/week} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Since the company performed very well for the whole month, Watson also receives the $300 bonus for each of the 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total bonus for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 1200 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we add his total earnings from his hourly wage and the total bonus to find his total earnings for April.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 3200 \, \text{\$} + 1200 \, \text{\$} = 4400 \, \text{\$} \]

Thus, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:

\[ \boxed{4400} \]"
"John arm wrestled 20 people. He beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he lost to, we first calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 4 \]"
"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.

1. **Morning Sales Calculation:**
   - The bakery produces 60 loaves each day.
   - Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning.
   - Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the morning is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
     \]

2. **Remaining Loaves After Morning:**
   - After selling 40 loaves in the morning, the remaining loaves are:
     \[
     60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
     \]

3. **Afternoon and Evening Sales:**
   - Half of the remaining 20 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.
   - Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
     \]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we start by calculating Joey's weekly weight loss. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weekly weight loss is:

\[ \text{Weekly weight loss by Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy needs to lose 2 pounds per week. Therefore, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds per week is:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/week}} = 1 \text{ week} \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the savings, we need to calculate the difference in cost for both the ice cream and the milk when bought at the original prices versus the discounted prices.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the discount is the same for each packet, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5
- Savings on one packet of milk: $0.5

Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the number of new limbs Helena's serum will cause a person to grow after fifteen days, we need to calculate the growth of both extra arms and extra legs based on their respective intervals.

1. **Extra Arms:**
   - The serum grows an extra arm every 3 days.
   - We need to find out how many times 3 days fit into 15 days.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{15}{3} = 5 \)
   - Therefore, the person will grow 5 extra arms in 15 days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - We need to find out how many times 5 days fit into 15 days.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \)
   - Therefore, the person will grow 3 extra legs in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs.
   - Calculation: \( 5 + 3 = 8 \)

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs.

The final numerical answer is:
8"
"To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we start by calculating the total cost of the items he has already bought.

First, we calculate the cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since each business suit costs $100, we have:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Now, we sum up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on other items (business suits, suitcases, flight ticket, and gifts) is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Subtracting the cost of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the total amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

Therefore, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we start by calculating the daily egg consumption.

1. **Daily Egg Consumption Calculation:**
   - Three people eat 3 eggs each day, so they consume \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.
   - The remaining two people eat 2 eggs each day, so they consume \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.
   - Therefore, the total daily egg consumption is \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

2. **Weekly Egg Consumption Calculation:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly egg consumption is \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

Thus, the family will consume \(\boxed{91}\) eggs in a week."
"Given the relationships in the problem, we can set up the following equations based on the ages of the individuals:

- Let \( Q \) represent Quinn's age.
- Let \( J \) represent Jane's age.
- Let \( T \) represent Trent's age.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( Q = 30 \) (Quinn is 30 years old).
2. \( J = Q - 3 \) (Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn).
3. \( T = J + 5 \) (Trent is 5 years older than Jane).

First, we calculate Jane's age:
\[
J = Q - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
\]

Next, we calculate Trent's age:
\[
T = J + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
\]

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"To find the current population of Chile, let's proceed with the algebraic steps:

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Relate the population of Chile six years ago to Noah's age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).

5. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - So, \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

6. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Since the population of Chile six years ago was 120000, the current population is \(120000 \times 2 = 240000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{240000}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of players on the defense as \( D \). According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is \( 2D \) and the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how many people showed up for Martha's party, we start by calculating the total number of people initially invited. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. This gives us:

\[2 \times 6 + 3 \times 4 = 12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness, which is 8 people. Additionally, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments, which is:

\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is:

\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Subtracting the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited gives us the number of people who showed up:

\[24 - 10 = 14\]

Therefore, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To find the total weight of the marbles Solomon has, we start by calculating the total number of marbles he possesses. Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna and received an additional 8 marbles from his father, who gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times the number of marbles he bought. Therefore, the total number of marbles is:

\[ 20 + 8 = 28 \]

Each marble weighs 2 kg. To find the total weight of the marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble:

\[ 28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ kg} \]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is:

\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine the total number of children in the classroom, we start with the given information:

- The number of boys is 30.
- The number of girls is 3 times the number of boys, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\).
- The number of nongendered children is \(\frac{1}{10}\) of the number of boys, which is \(\frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3\).

To find the total number of children, we sum the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children:
\[
\text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
\]

Thus, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Given the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, and the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can determine the number of electric poles required by understanding the ratio.

The ratio 1:3 means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires. If the total number of electric wires is 45, we can set up the proportion based on the ratio:

\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find the number of electric poles \( P \), we solve the equation:

\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the initial number of men and women at the party. Initially, there are 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people leave. The number of people who leave is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]
This means that 10 people leave the party. Therefore, the number of people remaining is:
\[
40 - 10 = 30
\]

We are given that 22 men stayed at the party. This means that the number of men who left is:
\[
25 - 22 = 3
\]
Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the number of women who left is:
\[
10 - 3 = 7
\]
Initially, there were 15 women, so the number of women remaining is:
\[
15 - 7 = 8
\]

Thus, the number of women left at the party is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To find the cost of the pen, we start by determining the cost of the magazine. Given that the magazine costs half as much as a book and the book costs $4, we calculate the magazine's cost as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the magazine's cost:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1 \]"
"To determine the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we first need to find out how many pencils Jam has. We know that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils, which together total 26 pencils. This can be expressed as:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils Jam has is:

\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Next, we know that Meg has 46 pencils. Adding the pencils of Jam and Meg together gives:

\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils, where each box holds 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:

\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Thus, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon’s iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to focus on the cooling effect since the addition of cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters weaker.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Adding 15 milliliters of cream does not affect the milliliters weaker calculation. Thus, the total reduction in milliliters due to the cooling is:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To determine the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people, we start with the given trade ratio: 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. This means that for every 1 new record received, 2 old records are required.

Given that 5 people leave with 7 new records, we need to calculate the total number of old records required to obtain these 7 new records. Since 2 old records are needed for 1 new record, for 7 new records, the calculation is as follows:

\[ \text{Total old records} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total number of old records the 5 people brought in is 14.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of junior and senior programmers. Given that the total number of employees is 100 and the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

The number of senior programmers is then:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Next, we know the monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000. Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is:

\[ \text{Salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Now, we calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:

\[ \text{Total salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Similarly, we calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Adding these two amounts gives the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total monthly salary} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the initial number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second bus stop is:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

According to the problem, after the second bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So we set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's calculate the number of lollipops Oscar has step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first calculate the percentage of charging required. The phone needs to charge an additional 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

\[
\text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[
120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time required to fully charge the phone is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how much the customer paid for their shopping trip, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, the rewards earned are:
     \[
     \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their rewards on this shopping trip.
   - Since they earned 4 rewards, they used 4 rewards.
   - Each reward is worth $1 off the next purchase.

3. **Calculate the discount from the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.
   - Therefore, the discount from the coupon is:

     \]

Thus, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we first calculate the net pay for each job.

For Job A:
- Annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

For Job B:
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax on net income: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
- $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate compared to the other job. The final answer is $8,400."
"To determine the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we start with the total number of castles, which is 220. 

First, we calculate the number of ruined castles. Since 40 percent of the castles are ruins, we find this by calculating 40% of 220:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 220 = 0.40 \times 220 = 88 \]
So, there are 88 ruined castles.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. Given that half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we calculate half of 88:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \text{ of } 88 = 0.50 \times 88 = 44 \]
Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles is 44.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Next, we add 10 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 70 \]

Thus, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables. Let \( C \) represent the number of cows and \( H \) represent the number of chickens. According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. There are twice as many chickens as cows.

This gives us the following system of equations:
\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now, we find the number of chickens \( H \):
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Thus, the total number of legs the animals have, all together, is \(\boxed{160}\)."

2. **Weight of the blue beetle:**
   Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle:
   \[
   \text{Weight of the blue beetle} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight of the green toad:**
   Since the pink frog weighs the same as the green toad:
   \[
   \text{Weight of the green toad} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Weight of the yellow snake:**
   The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake:
   \[
   \text{Weight of the yellow snake} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}

"To find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we start by calculating the individual costs:

- Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.
- Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
  \[
  \text{Cost of Juice Box B} = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
  \[
  \text{Cost of Juice Box C} = 4 + 7 = 11 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, to find the difference in cost between Juice Box C and Juice Box B:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Cost of Juice Box C} - \text{Cost of Juice Box B} = 11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Juice Box C costs 2 dollars more than Juice Box B. The final answer is 2 dollars."

"Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag contains 36 cookies. She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week, which totals 20 cookies. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, which totals 7 cookies. To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the cookies her son and husband consume from the total number of cookies:

\[ 36 - 20 - 7 = 9 \]

Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies. The correct answer is:

\[ 9 \]"
"To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after a 40% discount, we start by calculating the total cost of the shirts without the discount. Each shirt costs $30, so for 2 shirts, the total cost is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the discount amount, which is 40% of $60:

\[ 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the discount from the original total cost gives us the final amount Davos paid:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors, we start by calculating the daily revenue for each scenario.

When the factory made tractors:
- They sold 10 tractors a day.
- Each tractor was sold for $100.

Thus, the daily revenue from tractors was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Now, when the factory makes silos:
- They sell 5 silos a day.
- Each silo is sold for $220.

Thus, the daily revenue from silos is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

To find the percentage increase in daily revenue:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New daily revenue} - \text{Old daily revenue}}{\text{Old daily revenue}} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = 0.1 \times 100\% = 10\% \]

Therefore, the percentage increase in daily revenue is 10%."
"To determine how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we first calculate her monthly expenses and then extend that to a yearly total.

1. **Food Cost per Month:**
   - Madeline spends $25 per week on food.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of food is \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \) dollars.

2. **Treats Cost per Month:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of treats is $20.

3. **Medicine Cost per Month:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of medicine is $100.

4. **Total Monthly Cost:**
   - Adding up the costs of food, treats, and medicine:
   \[
   100 \text{ (food)} + 20 \text{ (treats)} + 100 \text{ (medicine)} = 220 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

5. **Total Annual Cost:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the annual cost is:
   \[
   220 \text{ dollars per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 2640 \text{ dollars per year}
   \]

Thus, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year."
"To find the total duration of all Peyton’s after-work activities, we sum the durations of each activity:

- Monday's yoga class: 1 hour
- Tuesday's cooking class: 3 times Monday's yoga class, which is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event: 0.5 hours
- Thursday's museum tour: Half the duration of Tuesday's cooking class, which is \(3 / 2 = 1.5\) hours
- Friday's errands: 2 hours

Adding these durations together:

\[
1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, the total number of hours for all Peyton’s after-work activities is \(\boxed{7.5}\)."
"To determine how many plant pots April has left over, we start by calculating the total number of plant pots needed for the daisies and roses. Given that the school needs 30 plant pots for daisies and twice as many for roses, we have:

Number of plant pots for roses = 2 * 30 = 60

Adding the plant pots needed for both flowers gives:

Total plant pots needed = 30 (daisies) + 60 (roses) = 90

April initially bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought:

Plant pots left over = 100 - 90 = 10

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is 10."
"To determine how much Andrea saved, we start with the total amount of money she had initially, which is $36. After spending $11 on a sweater and giving $4 to her brother, the total amount spent is $11 + $4 = $15. Therefore, the amount saved is calculated by subtracting the total spent from the initial amount:

\[ 36 - 15 = 21 \]

Thus, Andrea saved $21. The correct answer is:

"John spends 6 hours boating and half that time, which is 3 hours, swimming. He also watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, totaling 6 hours. The combined time for boating, swimming, and watching shows is 15 hours, which is 30% of the total time spent. To find the total time \( T \), we solve the equation \( 0.30T = 15 \), which gives \( T = 50 \) hours. Since 40% of his total time was spent sightseeing, the time spent sightseeing is \( 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \) hours. Therefore, the time John spent sightseeing is \(\boxed{20}\) hours."
"To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we first calculate her total earnings from both jobs. From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours:

\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding her initial savings to her total earnings gives:

\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400, so the amount she still needs is:

\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To find the height of the tallest tree, let's proceed step by step:

1. The height of the shortest tree is given as 6 feet.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:
   \[
   6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
   \[
   6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"To determine how much money Dean has left, we start by calculating the total cost of the toys he bought. Dean bought 6 toy cars at $2 each and 5 teddy bears at $1 each.

First, calculate the cost of the toy cars:
\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

Next, calculate the cost of the teddy bears:
\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, add the costs of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total amount spent:
\[ \$12 + \$5 = \$17 \]

Dean's mother initially gave him $28. After spending $17, the amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Then, Dean's mother gives him an extra $10:
\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ \$21 \]

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Morgan's budget for the party is $90. She plans to spend $5 on arcade tokens and $5 on a round of mini-golf. Additionally, she wants to ride the go-karts twice, which costs $10 per ride. Therefore, the total cost for the go-karts is $10 * 2 = $20. Adding the costs of the mini-golf and arcade tokens, we get $5 + $5 + $20 = $30. Subtracting this total from her budget, $90 - $30 = $60, is the remaining amount she can use for go-kart rides. Since each go-kart ride costs $10, the number of friends she can invite, assuming each friend gets to ride the go-karts once, is $60 / $10 = 6. Therefore, the number of friends she can invite is 6."
"Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. Each day, she spends $1 on 4 lollipops, each costing 25 cents. Therefore, her daily savings, which she puts in her piggy bank, is $5 - $1 = $4. Over 5 days, her total savings are $4/day * 5 days = $20. 

Thus, the final amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is **$20**."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the total cost of the candy Billy bought. If the candy costs $1.5 per pound and he spent all $10 on candy, we can set up the equation:

\[ 1.5x = 10 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{10}{1.5} = \frac{100}{15} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \]

So, Billy bought approximately 6.67 pounds of candy. However, since the question asks for the number of pounds and we are dealing with a practical scenario where partial pounds of candy are not typically bought, we should consider the closest whole number or the exact fraction. Given the context, the exact number of pounds he bought is:

\[ x = \frac{20}{3} \]

However, if we are to choose from a multiple-choice option, the closest whole number would be 7 pounds, but the exact answer based on the given information is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{20}{3}} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the equation derived from the given information: Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice his son's age. Let's denote the son's age by \( x \). The relationship can be expressed as:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 25 \]"
"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first calculate the total distance of one complete round trip. The distances are as follows:

- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trips, which is \(100 + 75 = 175\) miles, so \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles

The total distance for one complete round trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days}\]

Converting \(\frac{1}{20}\) of a day into hours, we get:
\[\frac{1}{20} \times 24 = 1.2 \text{ hours}\]

Since the question asks for the number of days between services, and 1.2 hours is equivalent to 12 hours, the train goes between services every 12 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is:

\(\boxed{12}\)"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we start by calculating the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. Since a collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we calculate the average of 8 pounds and 2 pounds:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for 3 collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"To find the total time John spent on his trip, we need to calculate the time for each segment of the journey and then sum them up.

First, the time to drive to his friend's house is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, the time for the detour is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{21}{7} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Then, the time to drive back home is:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{24}{8} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Adding these times together gives the total time for the trip:
\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time for the trip is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"To determine the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday, we start with the total number of fourth-graders, which is 96. Given that 43 of them are girls, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls were absent, so the number of girls present is:

\[ 43 - 5 = 38 \]

Since the total number of fourth-graders is 96, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 96 - 38 = 58 - 4 = 54 \]

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

\[ 54 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 54 \]"
"Given that there are 6 girls in the park and the number of boys is twice the number of girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows: \(2 \times 6 = 12\). 

Adding the number of girls and boys together gives us the total number of kids in the park: \(6 + 12 = 18\).

Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) be the score she needs on her third test. The equation representing the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as \( x \). Given \( x = 3 \).

The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers for refusing to wear masks minus 5, which translates to:
\[ 4x - 5 \]
Substituting \( x = 3 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of customers for shoplifting, which translates to:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

The total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence is:
\[ x + 7 + 21 = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]
Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara.

Let \( E \) represent the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points. After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \). According to the problem, this is equal to three times Sara's points:

\[ E + 14 = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( E \):

\[ E + 14 = 24 \]
\[ E = 24 - 14 \]
\[ E = 10 \]

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we'll break down the expenses into different components and sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost, making the total cost per frame $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $24.
   - With 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the total number of hours Hallie had dance practice in a week is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment:**
   - Given that 40% of the total number of pieces are faulty, and the total number of pieces is \( \frac{400000}{\text{price per piece}} \), we can directly use the percentage to find the number of faulty pieces.
   - The number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4 \times N \), where \( N \) is the total number of pieces.
   - Since we are only interested in the percentage, we can directly use \( 0.4 \times 400000 \).

2. **Calculate the number of functioning pieces of equipment:**
   - The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces.
   - Number of functioning pieces = \( 400000 - 0.4 \times 400000 = 0.6 \times 400000 \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces:**
   - The total cost of the equipment is $400,000.
   - The cost of the functioning pieces is \( 0.6 \) times the total cost.
   - Total cost of functioning pieces = \( 0.6 \times 400000 \).

Now, let's perform the calculation:

\[
0.6 \times 400000 = 240000
\]

Thus, the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment is:

\[
\boxed{240000}

"To determine the total amount of milk Mary collects every day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of sheep**: Mary has 30 sheep.
2. **Half of the sheep providing 1 kg of milk each**: Half of the 30 sheep, which is 15 sheep, each provide 1 kg of milk per day. Therefore, the total milk from these 15 sheep is:
   \[
   15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg}
   \]
3. **Other half of the sheep providing 2 kg of milk each**: The remaining 15 sheep, each providing 2 kg of milk per day, contribute:
   \[
   15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg}

"To determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked, and she received $56 from selling them at $4 per apple. Therefore, the number of apples sold on Monday is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]

4. To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we sum the apples picked on each day:
   \[
   \text{Total number of apples picked} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples}
   \]

Thus, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

"To determine the monthly payment Karan has to make, we first calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest. The formula for the total amount to be paid, including interest, is:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Months}} \]

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (r) = 10% = 0.10
- Number of Months (n) = 5

First, we calculate the total amount to be paid:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5884.4115 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5884.4115}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.8823 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.88 \]

Therefore, the amount Karan has to pay per month is **$1176.88**."
"To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we first calculate the distance each person hiked.

For Cho:
- Speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time: 8 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

For Chloe:
- Speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time: 5 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distances hiked by Cho and Chloe:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we start by calculating the number of each type of peso they possess.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, which is \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Adding the silver pesos together:
\[50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos}\]

Adding the gold pesos together:
\[80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos}\]

Now, summing up all the pesos:
\[150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos}\]

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is \(\boxed{350}\)."
"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we start by calculating the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells 36 cups at $1 per cup, her total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of making the lemonade from the total revenue to find the profit:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open. Since she sells all 36 cups in 9 hours, the profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2/\text{hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the total amount of land Mr. Ruther initially had, we start with the information that he sold \(\frac{3}{5}\) of his land, leaving him with \(\frac{2}{5}\) of his land, which is 12.8 hectares. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
\]

To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate \(x\). We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(\frac{5}{2}\):

\[
x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[
x = 12.8 \times 2.5
\]

Converting 12.8 to a fraction for easier calculation:

\[
12.8 = \frac{128}{10} = \frac{64}{5}
\]

Now, multiply:

\[
x = \frac{64}{5} \times 2.5 = \frac{64}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{64 \times 5}{5 \times 2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32
\]

Thus, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially is:

\[
\boxed{32}

"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we start by calculating the number of girls in the choir. Given that 50% of the 52 members are girls, we have:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
\]

Since the choir performs only with its female members, the number of female members who can perform is:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

On the day of the performance, half of these female members can't make it due to their bus breaking down. Therefore, only half of the female members can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{13}{2} = 6.5
\]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, and assuming the context allows for rounding, we consider 6 or 7. However, typically in such problems, we consider the exact division, so we proceed with 6.5. The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 6.5 + 3 = 9.5
\]

Given the context, we round to the nearest whole number, which is 10. However, since the problem does not specify rounding and typically such problems expect a whole number, we consider the exact division and the context of the problem, leading us to:

\[
\boxed{10}

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

The cost of one pencil is $3, so the cost of 8 pencils is:
\[ 8 \times 3 = 24 \]

Adding these two amounts together gives:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is:
\[ 36 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To find the total number of messages James delivers, we start by calculating the number of messages to Mr. Yu. Given that he delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson and 1/3 as many to Mr. Yu, we calculate:

\[
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

Adding the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu gives us the total:

\[
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88

"Given the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we can determine the number of popsicles each has by setting up the following equations based on the ratio and the total.

Let \( B \) represent the number of popsicles Betty has, and \( S \) represent the number of popsicles Sam has. The ratio \( B:S = 5:6 \) can be expressed as:
\[ B = 5k \]
\[ S = 6k \]
for some constant \( k \).

The total number of popsicles is given by:
\[ B + S = 165 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( k \):
\[ 5k + 6k = 165 \]
\[ 11k = 165 \]
\[ k = \frac{165}{11} \]
\[ k = 15 \]

Now, we can find the number of popsicles each has:
\[ B = 5k = 5 \times 15 = 75 \]
\[ S = 6k = 6 \times 15 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty:
\[ S - B = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"To determine the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we first need to sum up all the time she spent on each activity and then find the proportion of that time spent editing.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours
  \[
  4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent recording the song: half of the time spent writing it
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes

Next, we sum up the total time spent:
\[
240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we calculate the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{450 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\%

"To determine the total number of Valentine's cards Erica has, we start with the initial number of cards she made and the cards her dad brought:

1. Erica made 20 cards.
2. Her dad brought 2 boxes of cards, with each box containing 15 cards. Therefore, the total number of cards her dad brought is \(2 \times 15 = 30\).

Adding these together, the total number of cards Erica has before any are passed out or received is:
\[ 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Next, we account for the cards that were passed out and received:
- Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

To find the net change in the number of cards Erica has, we subtract the cards passed out and add the cards received:
\[ 50 - 24 + 17 \]

Performing the arithmetic step-by-step:
\[ 50 - 24 = 26 \]
\[ 26 + 17 = 43 \]

Therefore, the total number of Valentine's cards Erica now has is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

1. **Initial number of cannolis:**
   Let \( C \) represent the initial number of cannolis. According to the problem, \( C = 40 \).

2. **Number of cannolis after buying more:**
   Allan bought 60 more cannolis, so the new number of cannolis is:
   \[
   C + 60 = 40 + 60 = 100
   \]

3. **Initial number of corns:**
   The problem states that there is twice as much corn as cannolis initially. Therefore, the initial number of corns \( K \) is:
   \[
   K = 2 \times C = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Number of corns after buying fewer:**
   Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying more. Since he had 100 cannolis after buying more:
   \[
   \text{Number of corns after buying fewer} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis:**
   Now, we add the number of corns and cannolis Allan has:
   \[
   60 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 160
   \]

The combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[
\boxed{160}

"To determine the number of steps Elliott took during his jog, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.
2. **Steps from School and Home**: He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Therefore, the number of steps he took from school and home is:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]
3. **Additional Steps**: He also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total number of steps taken before his jog is:
   \[
   5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]
4. **Remaining Steps**: After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is:
   \[
   10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2000}

"To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we first calculate the total time it takes for Toby to read the book. The book is 45 pages long, and each page contains 200 words. Therefore, the total number of words in the book is:

\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. Thus, the time it takes to read the entire book is:

\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby plans to leave the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get to the airport. Therefore, he needs to finish reading the book 50 minutes before he needs to leave the airport. Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be:

\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

early.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we first calculate the total cost of her purchases.

1. **Taffy Cost Calculation:**
   - The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal.
   - For 2 pounds, the cost is $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound.
   - Total cost for taffy: \(3 + 1.50 = 4.50\).

2. **Seashells Cost Calculation:**
   - Each seashell costs $1.50.
   - Sally bought 4 seashells.
   - Total cost for seashells: \(4 \times 1.50 = 6.00\).

"Tim decides to light off some fireworks for the Fourth of July. He buys a package of fireworks worth $400 and another pack worth twice that much. He gets a 20% discount on them. He also buys a finale firework that costs $150. Let's calculate the total amount he spent.

First, we calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks:
- The first pack costs $400.
- The second pack costs $800 (twice the first pack).

The total cost of the two packs before the discount is:
\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Next, we apply the 20% discount on the total cost of the fireworks:
\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

Subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks:
\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Now, Tim buys a finale firework that costs $150. Adding this to the discounted cost of the fireworks:
\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim spent is:
\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies each night. Over 30 days, she will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Since her recipe makes 12 cookies per dozen, to find out how many dozens she needs to make 60 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a dozen:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozens} \]

Therefore, Shannon will need to make 5 dozens of cookies to last her for 30 days.

The final numerical answer is 5 dozens."
"To determine the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of dangerous candles:**
   - Given that 5% of the 50,000 candles are dangerous, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of dangerous candles} = 5\% \times 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500
     \]

2. **Determine the number of dangerous candles that explode:**
   - Since 1% of the dangerous candles are guaranteed to explode, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of dangerous candles that explode} = 1\% \times 2500 = 0.01 \times 2500 = 25
     \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:

"To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we start by calculating the sale price of each blouse after the 30% discount. The regular price of each blouse is $20. The discount amount per blouse is:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

Subtracting the discount amount from the regular price gives the sale price per blouse:

\[ \text{Sale price} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Since Misha picks out 4 blouses, the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:

"To determine how many apples Joanne gathered from the average trees, we start by setting up the equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees as \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

Given:
- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, which is \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers three times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) apples.
- Joanne's sister gathers no apples from the average trees, which is \( 0 \) apples.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation as:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

Thus, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations based on the information provided:

1. The total number of heads is 180, which gives us the equation:
\[ c + d = 180 \]

2. The total number of humps is 304, with camels having 2 humps and dromedaries having 1 hump, leading to the equation:
\[ 2c + d = 304 \]

We can solve this system of linear equations. First, we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now, substituting \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we'll break down the distances traveled each day and sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:

\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

"To determine Mr. Josue's total capital after receiving funds from the banks, we start by calculating the amount received from the second bank. Given that the second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, which is $4000, the amount from the second bank is:

\[ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \]

Adding the amounts from both banks to his initial capital of $5000, we get:

\[ 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000 \]

Therefore, the total capital Mr. Josue has now is:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats each carried away 5 cats, so a total of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cats were taken away. This leaves \(50 - 20 = 30\) cats.

Next, \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran away is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18\). Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is \(30 - 18 = 12\).

Thus, the number of cats left on the rock is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To calculate the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break down the cost into different periods based on the pricing changes.

1. **First 6 months:**
   - The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for 6 months = \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \) dollars.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8):**
   - The cost is $12 per month.
   - Total cost for 2 months = \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Next 10 months (months 9 to 18):**
   - The cost is $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 10 months = \( 10 \times 14 = 140 \) dollars.

Now, we sum up the costs for all the periods:
\[
48 + 24 + 140 = 212

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\boxed{212}\) dollars."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the costs of the jeans. Let the cost of the tattered jeans be \( T \) and the cost of the jogger jeans be \( J \). From the problem, we know:

1. \( T = 28 \) dollars.
2. \( J = T - 6 \).

First, we calculate the cost of the jogger jeans:
\[ J = 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we denote the total savings as \( S \). Since Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, we have:
\[ S_J = \frac{1}{3} S \]
\[ S_T = \frac{2}{3} S \]

Given that the total savings \( S \) is $6:
\[ S_J + S_T = 6 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} S + \frac{2}{3} S = 6 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

Now, we find the individual savings:
\[ S_J = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ S_T = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is $2, and the savings from the tattered jeans is $4. Since the tattered jeans cost $28, the original cost of the jogger jeans was $22. The difference in cost between the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the number of bird feeders and the number of birds each type of feeder attracts.

First, Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more from the store, making a total of 6 bird feeders.

Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds per day. Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the store-bought feeders is:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds/feeder} = 60 \text{ birds} \]

Each of the bird feeders Lillian made herself attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, which means each of her bird feeders attracts:
\[ 20 \text{ birds/feeder} + 10 \text{ birds/feeder} = 30 \text{ birds/feeder} \]

Therefore, the total number of birds attracted by the bird feeders Lillian made herself is:
\[ 3 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds/feeder} = 90 \text{ birds} \]

Adding the birds attracted by both types of feeders gives:
\[ 60 \text{ birds} + 90 \text{ birds} = 150 \text{ birds} \]

Thus, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is:
\[

"To determine the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we'll calculate the cost of each item step by step.

1. **Bagel**: The bagel costs $4.
2. **Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the price of the bagel.
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of soup} = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. **Cake**: The cake is half the price of the bagel.
   \[
   \text{Cost of cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bagel} + \text{Cost of soup} + \text{Cost of cake}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11
\]

Therefore, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To determine the total number of cards Kenny started with, we can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let \( x \) represent the total number of cards Kenny initially had.

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards, and he gets $1.5 for each card sold. Therefore, the total money he earns from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Total money from selling cards} = \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) \times 1.5 = x \]

After selling the cards, he has $50 left, which means the total money he had initially from selling the cards is:
\[ x = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[ x = 50 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's go through the steps methodically:

1. **Determine the number of guests who would have eaten two hotdogs if everyone had only eaten one:**
   - Half of 36 guests would have eaten two hotdogs each.
   - Half of 36 is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).
   - So, 18 guests would have eaten two hotdogs each.

2. **Calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared:**
   - 18 guests would have eaten 2 hotdogs each, so \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - This means the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs.

3. **Determine the number of guests who actually wanted a second hotdog:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog.
   - Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, 4 hotdogs were left unprepared.

4. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - Out of the 40 guests, 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4.

The final answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To find the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names, we start by noting that Indras' name has 6 letters. Half of the letters in Indras' name is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Her sister's name has 4 more letters than this half, so we add 4 to 3:

\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Therefore, her sister's name has 7 letters. Adding the letters in both names together:

\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

Thus, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is:

\[
\boxed{13}

Thus, the final amount Charlotte has to pay is $132.00."
"To determine how much more money Dora needs, we start by calculating the total cost of the items she wants to buy:

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Next, we sum the money Dora has:
- Money from allowance: $2
- Money from mother: $16

Total money Dora has:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs an additional $1 to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew, we will follow a step-by-step approach using arithmetic and fractions.

1. **Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.**
2. **Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.** This means:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
3. **Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.** Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
4. **Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.** Consequently:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Prince Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To determine how much gas Josey needed, we start by calculating the amount of gas in each container. Given that 15 gallons of gas are divided equally into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \text{Gas in each container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, which translates to:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, the amount of gas needed in pints is:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down algebraically:

1. **Total Money Spent and Left:**
   George spent $5 and had 1% left, meaning he spent $4.95.

2. **Cost of Chips:**
   Each bag of chips costs $0.40. If George bought 3 bags, the total cost for chips is:
   \[
   3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Money Left for Candy Bars:**
   Subtract the cost of chips from the total spent:
   \[
   4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Candy Bars:**
   Each candy bar costs $0.75. The number of candy bars George could buy with $3.75 is:
   \[
   \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5

"To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to arrive at the theater first, we start by noting the time it takes for Wayne to drive to the theater. According to the problem, Wayne's drive takes 4 minutes.

Next, we calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater. The problem states that Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes}
\]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time it takes Wayne to drive to the theater from the time it takes Bernadette to drive to the theater:

\[
\text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} - \text{Time for Wayne's drive} = 16 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = 12 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start with the given area and length. The area of the room is 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards, which converts to 9 feet.

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]

Solving for the width:
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

"When Marcus wakes up, his house is at 40 degrees. After spending 3 hours baking in an oven that raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, the temperature increases by:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the temperature after baking is:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, causing the temperature to decrease by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. The number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals} \]

Thus, the total temperature decrease due to the window is:

\[ 3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the final temperature after the window is closed is:

\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

The house's final temperature is \(\boxed{49}\)."

   - Given that Jon won by 10 minutes, James' total time is \(170 + 10 = 180\) minutes

5. **Determine James' run time:**
   - Let \(R\) be the time James took to run.
   - James' total time is the sum of his swim, bike, and run times: \(36 + 85 + R = 180\)
   - Solving for \(R\): \(121 + R = 180\)
   - Therefore, \(R = 180 - 121 = 59\) minutes

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is \(\boxed{59}\) minutes."
"To determine the length of Movie A, we start by converting the length of Movie C from hours to minutes. Given that Movie C is 1.25 hours long, we convert this to minutes as follows:

\[ 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, the length of Movie B is:

\[ 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, we calculate the length of Movie A as:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the length of Movie A is 20 minutes."
"To determine the change Michael has after buying the hay, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs:**

"To determine how many trays Rozanne can put out, we start by calculating the total number of eggs she has. She uses 4 dozen eggs, and since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 4 dozen eggs equal \(4 \times 12 = 48\) eggs. Additionally, she has 2 loose eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is \(48 + 2 = 50\) eggs.

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses of eggnog she can make, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:
\[
\frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:

"To determine the profit, we first calculate the cost price per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[
\text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling 17 sneakers at $20 each:

\[
\text{Revenue from Monday sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
\]

The remaining sneakers sold to the department store are:

\[
48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
\]

The revenue from selling these 31 sneakers at $25 each is:

\[
\text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the revenues from both sales gives the total revenue:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total cost for 48 sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[
\text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}

"To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

Given that the super ticket costs $20 and includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1, the total cost for the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and soda separately:
\[ 21 = 15 + P - 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 21 = 13 + P \]
\[ P = 21 - 13 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

Thus, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original cost per balloon:**
   - The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   - Therefore, the cost per balloon was:
     \[
     \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the new cost per balloon after the price increase:**
   - The cost per balloon increased by $20.
   - Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
     \[
     \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - The cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - First, break down the multiplication:
     \[
     170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
     \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     \[
     170 \times 60 = 10200
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 5 = 850
     \]

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:

1. For the first segment:
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \( 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \)

2. For the second segment:
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \( 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \)

Next, we add the distances to find the total distance:
\[ 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we calculate the total time taken:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

Next, we multiply their combined daily consumption by the number of days, which is 30. Thus, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(8 \times 30 = 240\).

Therefore, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"To determine the cost of potting soil for Bob's raised beds, we first calculate the volume of one raised bed. Each raised bed measures 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Substituting the dimensions of one raised bed:

\[ V = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of potting soil needed is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags required is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

"To determine the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms, we first need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item per room and then sum them up.

1. **Sheets per room**: Each room has 2 sheets.
2. **Comforters per room**: Each room has 1 comforter.
3. **Pillow cases per room**: Each room has twice as many pillow cases as sheets. Since there are 2 sheets, there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pillow cases.
4. **Towels per room**: Each room has twice as many towels as pillow cases. Since there are 4 pillow cases, there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) towels.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of laundry per room:
- Sheets: 2
- Comforters: 1
- Pillow cases: 4
- Towels: 8

Total pieces of laundry per room = \(2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15\).

Since there are 80 rooms, the total number of pieces of laundry for 80 rooms is:
\[ 15 \times 80 = 1200 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is \(\boxed{1200}\)."
"To determine the number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we start with the initial number of shoes he has, which is 200.

Next, we account for the shoes he gains:
- On Monday, he gains 5 pairs of shoes, which is \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes.
- On Wednesday, he gains 15 pairs of shoes, which is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) shoes.
- On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes, which is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes.

Adding these gains to his initial number of shoes:
\[ 200 + 10 + 30 + 60 = 300 \text{ shoes} \]

Then, on Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes:
\[ 300 - 180 = 120 \text{ shoes} \]

"To find out how many pencils are left at the end of the year, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year:**
   - Each of the 30 students started with 10 pencils.
   - Total pencils = 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

2. **Determine the number of pencils used after two months:**
   - After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used.
   - Pencils used = 1/5 * 300 pencils = 60 pencils.

3. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months:**
   - Remaining pencils = Total pencils - Pencils used
   - Remaining pencils = 300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils.

4. **Determine the number of pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * Remaining pencils
   - Pencils left = 1/3 * 240 pencils = 80 pencils.

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

"To determine the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we start by converting the shark's length from feet to inches. Given that the shark is 10 feet long and knowing that 1 foot equals 12 inches, we calculate:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we consider the length of the remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras attached to the shark. Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. The final answer is:

\[ 10\% \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation based on the given information.

"To determine how long Jason needs to spend walking each day, we start by calculating the total number of days he will walk in three weeks. Since three weeks is equivalent to 21 days, and he plans to walk 4 days a week, we can proceed as follows:

\[
\text{Total number of days} = 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many minutes he should walk each day to accumulate a total of 240 minutes over 21 days. We do this by dividing the total minutes by the total number of days:

\[
\text{Minutes per day} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{21 \text{ days}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\text{Minutes per day} = \frac{240}{21} \approx 11.428571428571429
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, we get:

\[
\text{Minutes per day} \approx 11.43
\]

Therefore, Jason needs to spend approximately 11.43 minutes walking each day. The correct answer is:

"To determine the number of kids who are not allergic to anything, we start by applying the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both.

Given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both is calculated as:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - |A \cup B| = 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:

The total number of people going on the tour is **621**."
"To determine the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we'll break down the expenses step by step.

First, calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since each plane ticket costs $5000 and there are two tickets:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to find the hotel cost. The normal price of the hotel per day is $1500, and it is 20% more expensive during the busy weekend. Therefore, the cost per day at the hotel is:
\[ 1500 + (0.20 \times 1500) = 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]

They are staying for 3 days, so the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Finally, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

"To determine how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player compared to Gabriel, we start by calculating the number of songs each has already on their players.

Gabriel has 20 songs. Since Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, we calculate Luri's songs as follows:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Each player can store up to 100 songs. Therefore, we calculate how many more songs each can add:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ for Gabriel} \]
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ for Luri} \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:

The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate the term with \( D \):

\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( D \):

\[ D = 9 \]

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many insects Lily found. Since Lily found 7 more than David:

\[ \text{Insects found by Lily} = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, the number of insects Lily found is 16. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we start by calculating the amount of yarn each used individually and then summing these amounts.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and since there are 364 yards in a skein, she used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn, so she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Adding the amounts of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma gives:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards."
"To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie buys, we start by calculating the gifts for her friends. 

First, we calculate the gifts for the 2 friends who each want 5 gifts:
\[2 \times 5 = 10\]

Next, we calculate the gifts for the 3 friends who each want 2 gifts:
\[3 \times 2 = 6\]

Adding these together gives the total number of gifts for her friends:
\[10 + 6 = 16\]

Cherrie then decides to buy 10 more random gifts as a surprise. Therefore, the total number of gifts she buys is:
\[16 + 10 = 26\]

Thus, the total number of gifts Cherrie buys is \(\boxed{26}\)."
"To determine the length of the couch, we start with the given information:

1. The width of the chair is 3 feet.
2. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the width of the rug is:
   \[
   3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. First, we calculate twice the width of the rug:
   \[
   2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Adding 2 feet to this result gives the length of the couch:
   \[
   16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the length of the couch is 18 feet.

\[
\boxed{18}

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \). Given that Suzie bought four packs of gum in total, with two packs being strawberry gum, one pack of grape gum for $2, and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1, we can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:

\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 4 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 2 \]

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make with his budget, we need to evaluate the cost and yield of both types of wood.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24, given that each 2 x 4 costs $4:

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]

Each 2 x 4 piece yields 200 sticks, so the total number of sticks from 6 pieces of 2 x 4 wood is:

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces of wood Frederick can buy with $24, given that each 2 x 8 costs $6:

\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]

Each 2 x 8 piece yields 400 sticks, so the total number of sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood is:

\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 8 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Since 1600 sticks from 2 x 8 pieces is greater than 1200 sticks from 2 x 4 pieces, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is from the 2 x 8 pieces of wood.

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks he can make is:

\[
\boxed{1600}
\]"
"To find out the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his sled dogs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Number of Dogs:** Mario has 6 sled dogs.
2. **Legs per Dog:** Each dog has 4 legs.
3. **Total Legs:** Multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs per dog:
   \[
   6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per dog} = 24 \text{ legs}
   \]
4. **Pairs of Legs:** Since each pair of legs corresponds to one dog, the number of pairs of legs is the same as the number of dogs:
   \[
   6 \text{ pairs of legs}
   \]
5. **Cost per Pair of Snowshoes:** Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.
6. **Total Cost:** Multiply the number of pairs of legs by the cost per pair:
   \[
   6 \text{ pairs of snowshoes} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 72 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is **72 dollars**."
"To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass, we first calculate the total cost of her bus trips without the pass. Janet takes 2 bus trips each day and does this for 5 days a week, resulting in 10 bus trips per week. Each bus trip costs $2.20. Therefore, the total cost for her bus trips is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

The weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much she would save by buying the pass, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of her bus trips: \(22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00\) dollars.

Thus, Janet would save **$2.00** by buying the weekly bus pass."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start with the information that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can set up the following relationship:

Let \( S_o \) be the number of onions Sophia bought, and \( S_p \) be the number of potatoes Sophia bought. According to the problem, we have:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

First, we calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:
\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Next, we set up the equation:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

To find \( S_o + S_p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine the daily calorie deficit Andy needs to achieve his goal, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pounds Andy needs to lose:**
   Andy wants to lose 30 pounds.

2. **Determine the total number of calories Andy needs to burn:**
   Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound, for 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
   \[
   30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of days Andy has until his goal:**
   Andy's goal is on July 19th, and today is December 31st. We need to count the days from December 31st to July 19th.

   - **December:** 31 - 31 = 0 days (since December 31st is the last day of December)
   - **January:** 31 days
   - **February:** 28 days (2023 is not a leap year)
   - **March:** 31 days
   - **April:** 30 days
   - **May:** 31 days
   - **June:** 30 days
   - **July:** 19 days (up to July 19th)

   Adding these days together:

"To determine how much money Julie has left after her expenditures, we start with her initial amount of $500.

First, Julie spends 20% of $500 on clothes:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]
So, after buying clothes, she has:
\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Next, she spends 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]
Thus, after buying CDs, she has:
\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \). According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we have:

\[ H = 3L \]

We also know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write:

\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Substituting \( H = 3L \) into the second equation, we get:

\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]

Combining like terms, we find:

\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:

\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now, substituting \( L = 30,000 \) back into the equation \( H = 3L \), we get:

\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how long it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we start by understanding the painting rate of one person. Given that one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we can deduce the daily painting rate of one person.

1. **Determine the daily painting rate of one person:**
   - One person paints half a house in 5 days, so in one day, one person paints \(\frac{1}{2} \div 5 = \frac{1}{10}\) of a house.

2. **Calculate the combined daily painting rate of 5 people:**
   - If one person paints \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day, then 5 people together can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}\) of a house in one day.

3. **Determine the time required for 5 people to paint a whole house:**
   - Since 5 people can paint \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a house in one day, they will need \(2\) days to paint a whole house.

4. **Convert the time from days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day, so 2 days is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 48 hours to paint a whole house.

"Given the problem, we start by defining the variables and using the relationships provided:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, which means \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation gives us \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), solving for \( C_O \) yields \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3C_O \). Substituting \( C_O = 22 \) into this equation gives us \( C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, which means \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation gives us \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
- Total sofas: \( S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \)
- Total chairs: \( C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \)
- Total number of sofas and chairs: \( 84 + 88 = 172 \)

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had not bought the headphone set, we can set up an algebraic equation.

Let \( C \) represent the cost of one CD, and \( H \) represent the cost of the headphone set. We know that:
\[ C = 4 \]
\[ C + H = 48 \]

First, we solve for \( H \):
\[ H = 48 - C \]
\[ H = 48 - 4 \]
\[ H = 44 \]

Next, we determine how many CDs Tom could buy with the money he spent on the headphone set:
\[ \text{Number of CDs with headphone set} = \frac{H}{C} = \frac{44}{4} = 11 \]

Then, we calculate how many CDs Tom could buy with the full amount of money he had:
\[ \text{Number of CDs without headphone set} = \frac{48}{C} = \frac{48}{4} = 12 \]

Finally, the number of additional CDs Tom could have bought is:
\[ 12 - 11 = 1 \]

"Let's solve the problem step by step with a clear and concise approach.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 passengers get off the bus.
- The number of passengers who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 passengers get off the bus.
- The number of passengers who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) passengers.

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

Therefore, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve the problem using algebra, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - Let \( J \) represent Jame's current age.
   - According to the problem, in 5 years, Jame will be 27 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     J + 5 = 27
     \]
   - Solving for \( J \):
     \[
     J = 27 - 5 = 22
     \]
   - So, Jame is currently 22 years old.

2. **Determine his cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - Let \( C \) represent his cousin's current age.
   - In 8 years, Jame will be 30 years old (since \( 22 + 8 = 30 \)).
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     C + 8 = 2 \times 30 - 5
     \]
   - Simplifying the right side:
     \[
     C + 8 = 60 - 5 = 55
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = 55 - 8 = 47
     \]
   - So, his cousin is currently 47 years old.

3. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - The age difference is:
     \[
     47 - 22 = 25
     \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and using the given information. Let \( C \) represent the cost of the computer, \( M \) the cost of one monitor, and \( P \) the cost of the printer. We are given the following information:

1. The total cost of the computer, two monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. The cost of the printer is $400 less than the cost of the computer, so \( P = C - 400 \).
3. The cost of the computer is $1,100, so \( C = 1100 \).

First, substitute the value of \( C \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Next, we use the total cost equation:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
Substitute the known values of \( C \) and \( P \):
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many seashells each girl brought. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - The number of boys and girls is equal.
   - Therefore, the number of boys and girls is:
     \[
     \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys:**
   - Each boy brought 60 seashells.
   - The total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
     \[
     10 \times 60 = 600
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of seashells brought by the girls:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - The number of seashells brought by the boys is 60.
   - Four times the number of seashells brought by the boys is:
     \[
     4 \times 60 = 240
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by each girl is:
     \[
     60 + 240 = 300
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought by all the girls:**
   - There are 10 girls.
   - The total number of seashells brought by all the girls is:
     \[
     10 \times 300 = 3000
     \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"Given the problem, we can set up an algebraic equation to solve it. Let \( G \) represent the number of candies George originally had. According to the problem, George ate 5 candies and was left with 3 candies. Therefore, we can write:

\[ G - 5 = 3 \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 3 + 5 \]
\[ G = 8 \]

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George initially, we can express the number of candies Nick had as:

\[ N = 2G \]
\[ N = 2 \times 8 \]
\[ N = 16 \]

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

Thus, Anne is 8 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To find the total thickness of the four books, we will add their individual thicknesses step by step.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which makes it \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, which makes it \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, we sum the thicknesses:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

Adding these values:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

Therefore, the total thickness of the four books is \(\boxed{188}\) mm."
"To determine how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month, we start by calculating the total number of vlogs she has already produced. She made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. Adding these together gives:

\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's monthly goal is 72 vlogs. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal. The final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine how much you ended up paying, we need to calculate the total amount including the tip.

1. **Calculate the tip:**
   - The dinner bill is $50.
   - You want to add an additional 20% tip.
   - To find 20% of $50, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Tip} = \text{Bill} \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount:**
   - The total amount is the sum of the bill and the tip:
     \[
     \text{Total Amount} = \text{Bill} + \text{Tip} = 50 + 10 = 60
     \]

Therefore, you ended up paying $60.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the final amount the eldest boy has.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - The total amount of $18 is shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy's initial share is:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his initial share:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the daily savings in the first half of April as \( x \). Consequently, the daily savings in the second half of April would be \( 2x \).

Given that April has 30 days, the first half consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days.

The total savings in the first half of April would be:
\[ 15x \]

The total savings in the second half of April would be:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings would be the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know that Elvis's monthly saving target is $1125. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Elvis needs to save $25 each day in the first half of April. Consequently, in the second half of April, he needs to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Thus, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine the change Verna received, we first calculate the total cost of the fruits she bought. 

The cost of the apples is calculated as follows:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, the cost of the oranges is calculated as follows:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, the cost of the peaches is calculated as follows:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost of the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the change Verna received is $7.00."
"To determine how much more Jairus earns compared to Jenny, we start by calculating their individual earnings based on the number of tasks they each completed.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task. Since he completed 20 tasks, his total earnings are:
\[
0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task. Since she also completed 20 tasks, her total earnings are:
\[
0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:
\[
16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Jairus earns $6 more than Jenny. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the amount of money Brad gets as \( B \) dollars. Given that Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff's amount can be expressed as \( 4B \) dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, we calculate Jeff's amount as:

\[ 4B = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 80 \]"

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Daily Recommended Coffee Intake**: Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

2. **Octavia's Coffee Intake**: Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups, so she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

3. **Juan's Coffee Intake**: Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

4. **Doctor's Recommendation**: Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

5. **Reduction Calculation**: To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the recommended intake from his current intake:
   \[
   5R - 4
   \]

Since the problem does not specify the value of \( R \), we cannot determine a specific numerical answer without that information. However, if we assume \( R = 8 \) (a common daily recommended amount of coffee), then:
\[
5R - 4 = 5 \times 8 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36
\]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we start by calculating their individual weights. Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so her weight is:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so his weight is:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we find the total weight of the three friends by adding their individual weights:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To determine the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is:
\[ 180 \text{ pounds} \]"
"To determine the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to consider the initial angle of the sun from the ground and the additional angle it has moved upward.

1. **Initial Angle of the Sun from the Ground:**
   - The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.
   - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is directly above the entrance.

2. **Sun's Movement:**
   - The sun moves at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.
   - Over 10 hours, the sun will move \( 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \) upward.

3. **Final Angle Calculation:**
   - Initially, the sun is at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground.
   - After 10 hours, the sun will be 50 degrees above the tip of the pyramid.
   - Therefore, the total angle from the ground to the sun will be the sum of the initial angle and the angle the sun has moved upward:
     \[
     32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
     \]

Thus, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{82}

"To determine how much James spends on candles, we start by calculating the total number of candles needed. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, making the other son 8 years old. Therefore, the total number of candles required is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of 5 candles are required. Since each pack contains 5 candles, the number of packs needed is 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Given that each pack costs $3, the total cost for 4 packs is 4 * $3 = $12.

Thus, the amount James spends on candles is $12."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total reading time in the first week
Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 days in the first week.
\[
15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the reading time in the first week to pages
We know that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[
\frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute}
\]

Now, we convert the 105 minutes of reading time in the first week to pages:
\[
105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 3: Add the reading time in the second week
In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

### Step 4: Calculate the total reading time in two weeks
\[
140 \text{ pages (first week)} + 100 \text{ pages (second week)} = 240 \text{ pages}
\]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we start with the total number of sandwiches, which is 12. 

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Adding the sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Subtracting the total eaten from the initial number of sandwiches:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is 5."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variable \( x \) as the current age of Shiloh's nephew. Given that Shiloh is currently 44 years old, in 7 years, Shiloh's age will be 51 years. At that same time, his nephew's age will be \( x + 7 \).

The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. This relationship can be expressed with the equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the current age of Shiloh's nephew is \( \boxed{10} \)."
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we will sum the amounts given for each set of teeth lost.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Total for these three teeth: \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth.
   - Amount per tooth for the last two teeth: \(\frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50\) dollars.
   - Total for the last two teeth: \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the amounts:

\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

\[
\boxed{9.00}

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of goals scored by each teenager in terms of a variable. Let's denote the number of goals scored by Anna as \( A \).

Given:
- Richie scored 80 goals.
- Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so \( R = A + 45 \).
- Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so \( R = M + 20 \).

From the information provided:
1. Since \( R = 80 \), we can substitute this into the equation \( R = A + 45 \):
   \[
   80 = A + 45 \implies A = 80 - 45 = 35
   \]
   So, Anna scored 35 goals.

2. Next, using \( R = M + 20 \) and knowing \( R = 80 \):
   \[
   80 = M + 20 \implies M = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]
   So, Mark scored 60 goals.

Now, to find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers:
\[
\text{Total goals} = R + M + A = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is \(\boxed{175}\)."

"To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to break down his spending over the week and calculate the number of each type of action figure he buys.

First, we calculate how much Peter spends each day:
- Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days).
- Therefore, he spends \( \frac{70}{7} = 10 \) dollars each day.

Next, we calculate how much he spends on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday:
- From Sunday to Wednesday, there are 4 days.
- Each wooden action figure costs $5.
- Therefore, the total amount spent on wooden action figures is \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) dollars.
- The number of wooden action figures he buys is \( \frac{20}{5} = 4 \).

Now, we calculate how much he spends on plastic action figures from Thursday through Sunday:
- From Thursday to Sunday, there are 4 days.
- Each plastic action figure costs $2.
- Therefore, the total amount spent on plastic action figures is \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) dollars.
- The number of plastic action figures he buys is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \).

Finally, we sum the total number of action figures:
- He has 4 wooden action figures.
- He has 4 plastic action figures.
- Therefore, the total number of action figures is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven when she needs 520 degrees, we first need to understand the percentage error in the current setting. When the oven is set to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The error is:

\[ 468 - 450 = 18 \]

The percentage error is:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

This means the oven is consistently off by 4%. To find the temperature setting that would result in an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to set up the equation based on the percentage error. If \( x \) is the temperature setting, the actual temperature will be:

\[ x - 0.04x = 0.96x \]

We know that the actual temperature should be 520 degrees:

\[ 0.96x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{0.96} \]
\[ x = 541.67 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to approximately 541.67 degrees to achieve the desired 520 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:

Next, convert the duration of the second movie into minutes:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
- Adding the 5 minutes, the second movie is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes.

Now, add the durations of the two movies:
- The first movie is 90 minutes long.
- The second movie is 125 minutes long.
- Adding these together, \(90 + 125 = 215\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we start with the value of Herb's house, which is $76,000. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive, we calculate 30% of $76,000 and subtract it from $76,000.

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

\[ \text{Value of Juan's house} = 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of both houses, we add the value of Herb's house to the value of Juan's house.

\[ \text{Combined value} = 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is \(\boxed{129200}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of cups and dishes Judy initially bought. Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

Next, we need to find out how many cups and dishes her friend brought. Her friend brought 40 cups. According to the problem, her friend brought 20 more dishes than cups, so her friend brought \(40 + 20 = 60\) dishes.

Now, we calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend. The total number of cups is \(12 + 40 = 52\). The total number of dishes is \(24 + 60 = 84\).

Adding these together, the total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both Judy and her friend is \(52 + 84 = 136\).

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{136}\)."
"To find the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts, we start by calculating the discounted price of one box. The original price of one box is $100.00, and with a 10% discount, the price becomes:

\[ 100.00 - (100.00 \times 0.10) = 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

So, one box of contacts costs $90.00 after the discount. For 2 boxes, the total cost is:

\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts, so 2 boxes contain:

\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

Since Pete uses one pair of contacts per day, 180 contacts will last for:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ contacts}}{2 \text{ contacts per pair}} = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:

\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

The cost per pair of contacts is **$2.00**."
"To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we first calculate the total hours each worked.

Jill worked:

   - Total calories burned during aerobics: \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories} \)

2. **Running:**
   - Duration: 1 hour
   - Calories burned per hour: 600 calories
   - Total calories burned during running: \( 1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories} \)

3. **Total calories burned:**
   - Total calories burned during aerobics and running: \( 1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories} \)

Next, we calculate the amount of water needed based on the calories burned. Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.

4. **Water consumption calculation:**
   - Water needed per 200 calories: 100 ml
   - Total water needed for 1600 calories: \( \frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml} \)

Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 800 ml.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left-hand side:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Thus, the number of green jelly beans that are more than the number of red jelly beans is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

"To find the weight of the Mastiff, we will follow the given weights step by step:

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
   \[
   \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
   \[
   44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds}
   \]

"To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we first calculate the total cost for each platform.

For Amazon:
- The cost of the boots is $16.
- The shipping cost is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is:
  \[
  16 + 4 = 20
  \]

For eBay:
- The cost of the boots is $13.
- The shipping cost is twice that of Amazon, which is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is:
  \[
  13 + 8 = 21
  \]

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:
\[
21 - 20 = 1
\]

Thus, the boots are \(\boxed{1}\) dollar more expensive on eBay."
"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we start with the initial height of the beanstalk, which is 4 feet, and it doubles in height every day. Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk each day:

- Day 0 (initial height): 4 feet
- Day 1: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet
- Day 2: \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet
- Day 3: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet

On Day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet height of Mark's window.

Therefore, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on Day 3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms contains 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
     \[
     200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total protein intake per week:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total protein intake per week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week}
     \]

The final numerical answer is 42 grams of protein per week."
"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

Given that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Therefore, the number of hours George needs to work is:
\[ \boxed{260} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the smallest angle as \( x \) degrees. According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, which is \( 2x \) degrees, and another angle is three times the smallest angle, which is \( 3x \) degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now, we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"To find the total amount of chocolate pounds Ruiz and Marissa made together in 12 hours, we start by calculating the hourly production rates and then extend that to 12 hours.

First, Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. Therefore, his hourly production rate is:
\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Next, Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much as Ruiz in one hour. Thus, her hourly production rate is:
\[
\text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates each makes in 12 hours:
\[
\text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

Adding these totals together gives us the combined total:
\[
\text{Total chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:
\[
\boxed{1260}

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   Howard spends $8 on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's spending} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday's spending} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Spending:**
   To find the total amount spent over the three days, we sum the amounts spent each day.
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Money:**
   Howard originally had $100. To find out how much he has left after his spending, we subtract the total spending from his initial amount.
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}

"To calculate the total earnings from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we'll break it down into two segments based on the given information.

For the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.50.

Earnings for the first 4 hours:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = 60 \times 0.50 = \$30.00 \]

For the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- The price per cup was $0.60.

Earnings for the next 2 hours:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = 20 \times 0.60 = \$12.00 \]

Summing the earnings from both segments:

"To determine how many years Jeremy's tires need to be replaced, we start by calculating the total number of rotations the tires undergo in a month. Given that the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles driven, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we first find the rotations per mile:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations for 400 miles:

\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

Now, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations the tires can undergo by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Total months} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert 72 months into years:

\[ \text{Total years} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find the cost of each pump in cents, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per wash:**
   - The total cost of the shampoo bottle is $24.00.
   - The total number of washes per bottle is 120 washes.
   - Therefore, the cost per wash is:
     \[
     \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
     \]

2. **Convert the cost per wash to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, the cost per wash in cents is:
     \[
     0.20 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 20 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost per pump:**
   - Each pump gives 60 washes.
   - Each wash costs 20 cents.
   - Therefore, the cost per pump is:
     \[
     60 \text{ washes per pump} \times 20 \text{ cents per wash} = 1200 \text{ cents}

"To determine how much money Joe will have left after purchasing the outfit, we start by calculating the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts.

The original price of the shirt is $25, and with a 30% discount, the discount amount is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
Thus, the discounted price of the shirt is:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The original price of the shorts is $35, and with a 30% discount, the discount amount is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
Thus, the discounted price of the shorts is:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Adding the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts gives the total cost of the outfit:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe initially has $50. After spending $42.00 on the outfit, the amount of money he will have left is:

"To determine how much more the basketball coach spent compared to the baseball coach, we first calculate the total expenditure for each coach.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each:
\[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]
So, the baseball coach spent $27.

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each:
\[ 8 \times 14 = 112 \]
So, the basketball coach spent $112.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach:
\[ 112 - 27 = 85 \]

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{85}

"To determine how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we start by calculating the total number of flowers. Given that there are 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row, the total number of flowers is:

\[
10 \times 20 = 200
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. Since \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the flowers have bloomed, we calculate:

\[
\frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160

"To determine Ashley's internet connection speed in megabytes per hour (Mb/h), we start with her speed in kilobytes per second (kb/s), which is 20 kb/s. 

First, we convert kilobytes to megabytes:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb/s} \times 0.001 \, \text{Mb/kb} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \]

Next, we convert this speed to megabytes per hour. Since there are 3600 seconds in an hour:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed in megabytes per hour is:
\[ 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 72 \]"
"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we'll break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

First, for the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the first three days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, for the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total number of cars pulled in the remaining four days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the cars pulled during the first three days and the remaining four days gives us the total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we first need to convert his current height from inches to feet. Adam's current height is 40 inches, and since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert this to feet as follows:

\[ 40 \text{ inches} \div 12 = \frac{40}{12} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet} \]

The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet. Therefore, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{12}{3} \text{ feet} - \frac{10}{3} \text{ feet} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \]

Adam grows 2 inches per year, which is equivalent to \(\frac{2}{12} = \frac{1}{6}\) feet per year. To find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet, we divide \(\frac{2}{3}\) feet by \(\frac{1}{6}\) feet per year:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \text{ feet} \div \frac{1}{6} \text{ feet/year} = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{6}{1} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in 4 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine how much James made from his sales, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars:**

"Given the prices and relationships provided, we can solve the problem step by step using algebra.

1. **Price of a Diamond Jewel (D):**
   \[ D = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

2. **Price of a Gold Jewel (G):**
   \[ G = \frac{4}{5} \times D = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Price of a Silver Jewel (S):**
   \[ S = G - 400 = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Total Price for All Three Jewels:**
   \[ \text{Total Price} = D + G + S = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total price for all three jewels is \( 4800 \) dollars."
"To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we start with the given information:

- Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
- He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so the number of truck stamps is \(16 + 3 = 19\).
- He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so the number of rose stamps is \(19 - 9 = 10\).

Adding these together gives the total number of stamps:
\[16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45\]

Therefore, the total number of stamps Max bought is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we start by calculating the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between them. The speed of Bob is 55 miles per hour, and the speed of Tom is 70 miles per hour. The relative speed is the difference between their speeds:

\[ v_{\text{relative}} = v_T - v_B = 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The distance between Bob and Tom is 75 miles. The time \( t \) it takes for Tom to close this gap can be found using the formula:

\[ t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{relative speed}} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how many fish Tommy caught, we start with the information given:

1. Naomi caught 17 fish.
2. Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi, so we calculate Darren's fish as \(17 - 6 = 11\).
3. Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so we calculate Tommy's fish as \(11 + 3 = 14\).

Therefore, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to ensure that the cost per class does not exceed $10. Given that the total cost for 10 classes is $60, we can calculate the maximum number of classes per class as follows:

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{n} \]

For the parents' condition to be met:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means that if Manny misses 6 or fewer classes, the cost per class will be at most $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"

1. **Daily Customer Count for Jewel:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.

2. **Daily Customer Count for Julie:**
   - Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) customers per day.

3. **Weekly Customer Count for Jewel:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - Total customers processed by Jewel in a week: \( 50 \times 7 = 350 \) customers.

4. **Weekly Customer Count for Julie:**
   - Julie processes 100 customers per day.
   - Total customers processed by Julie in a week: \( 100 \times 7 = 700 \) customers.

"To determine how many miles Lynn ran, we start by noting that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Given that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, we can express Lynn's distance as:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

Substituting the distance Reggie ran:

\[ 20 = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

To find Lynn's distance, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we start by determining the cost of one apple and one orange.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we calculate the cost of one apple:
\[
\text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of one orange:
\[
\text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10
\]

Now, we need to find the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00
\]

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

So, the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet.

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for Bob to dig this volume. It is given that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"

\]

Thus, the total cost of Bill's new truck is \(\boxed{43500}\) dollars."
"To determine Tim's annual income after his promotion, we start by calculating his new monthly salary and then add the bonus.

1. **Calculate the new monthly salary:**
   - Original monthly salary: $20,000
   - Raise: 5% of $20,000 = $1,000
   - New monthly salary: $20,000 + $1,000 = $21,000

2. **Calculate the bonus:**
   - Bonus: Half a month's salary = $21,000 / 2 = $10,500

3. **Calculate the total monthly income:**
   - Total monthly income = New monthly salary + Bonus
   - Total monthly income = $21,000 + $10,500 = $31,500

4. **Calculate the annual income:**
   - Annual income = Total monthly income \(\times\) 12
   - Annual income = $31,500 \(\times\) 12 = $378,000

Therefore, Tim will make $378,000 in a year."

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is **142**."
"Given the problem, we start by defining the total earnings from green hats in the first month as \( G \). According to the problem, the sales from red hats were $400, which is half the total amount earned from selling green hats. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 400 = \frac{1}{2} G \]

Solving for \( G \):

\[ G = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, the total earnings from green hats in the first month is $800. The total earnings in the first month are the sum of the earnings from red and green hats:

\[ \text{Total first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the total earnings in the second month are:

\[ \text{Total second month} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

To find the total earnings over the two months, we add the total earnings of the first month and the second month:

\[ \text{Total two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"To determine the total cost James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Total Hired Time**: James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which totals 4 hours.

2. **Free Hour**: James gets 1 hour of free carriage time, so he only pays for 3 hours.

3. **Hourly Rates**: The first hour costs $15, and each subsequent hour costs twice the previous hour.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The first hour costs $15.
   - The second hour costs $15 * 2 = $30.
   - The third hour costs $30 * 2 = $60.

5. **Total Paid**: Sum the costs of the paid hours:
   \[
   15 + 30 + 60 = 105 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount James paid is:
\[
\boxed{105}

"To determine how much was withheld from Sally's wage, we start by calculating the total amount Sally earned this week. She began with $200 in her bank account and now has $420. The difference between these amounts is the total earnings for the week:

\[ 420 - 200 = 220 \]

Sally's weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was withheld, we subtract her weekly wage from her total earnings:

\[ 220 - 300 = -80 \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that $80 was withheld from her wage. Therefore, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"To determine the number of eggs Lori needs, we start by calculating the total number of deviled egg halves required. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests. Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves} \]

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required to make 48 deviled egg halves. This is calculated by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Next, we convert the number of whole eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of whole eggs by 12:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ whole eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen eggs} \]

Therefore, Lori will need \(\boxed{2}\) dozen eggs."

"To determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we start by calculating the total number of days required to read the entire 200-page book at a rate of 10 pages per day.

\[
\text{Total pages} = 200
\]
\[
\text{Pages per day} = 10
\]
\[
\text{Total days required} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days}
\]

Given that the deadline is in 30 days, we then find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish:

\[
\text{Deadline} = 30 \text{ days}
\]
\[
\text{Days required} = 20 \text{ days}
\]
\[
\text{Days before deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to consider both the initial cost of the plane and the monthly expenses for renting a hanger and fuel.

1. **Initial Cost of the Plane:**
   The plane costs $150,000.

2. **Monthly Rent for the Hanger:**
   James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hanger.

3. **Monthly Cost for Fuel:**
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on renting the hanger. Therefore, the monthly cost for fuel is:
   \[
   2 \times 5000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Monthly Expenses:**
   The total monthly expenses for renting the hanger and fuel are:
   \[
   5000 + 10000 = 15000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Annual Expenses:**
   To find the annual expenses, we multiply the total monthly expenses by 12 (the number of months in a year):
   \[
   15000 \times 12 = 180000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total Cost for the First Year:**
   The total cost for the first year includes the initial cost of the plane and the annual expenses:
   \[
   150000 + 180000 = 330000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}

"Given the problem, we start by defining the cooking times for rice, beans, and pork as \( R \), \( B \), and \( P \) respectively.

From the problem, we know:
1. It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice, so \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. The time to cook beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) \).

First, we calculate the cooking time for pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
\[ P + R = 50 + 30 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we calculate the cooking time for beans:
\[ B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the total cooking time for all the food:
\[ R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

The total time it took to cook all the food is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we first calculate the cost of each mixture separately.

For the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

For the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations based on the information provided:

1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now, we have the system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

Thus, the number of sheep \( S \) is 15. To verify, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, we check the number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's coffee and donut, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. Therefore, the cost of the more expensive coffee is:
\[ \$5 + (0.20 \times \$5) = \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \text{ per pound} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week. Since he uses 1 pound of coffee per day, for 7 days, he needs:
\[ 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the coffee:
\[ 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$42 \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost of everything is:
\[ \$42 + \$2 = \$44 \]

Thus, the total cost is:
\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00, and a bottle of soda for $1.00. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the cost of the other items from the total amount spent.

The cost of the chips is \(2 \times 2.00 = 4.00\).

Adding the cost of the bucket of fried chicken and the bottle of soda, we get \(4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00\).

Subtracting this total from the $20.00 spent, we find the cost of the apple pie is \(20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00\).

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To determine how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we start with the total number of newspapers delivered in a day, which is 600. We then subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from this total.

The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198, and to District C is 209. Therefore, the calculation is as follows:

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - (198 + 209) \]
\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - 407 \]
\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 193 \]

Thus, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is 193."
"To determine how many recipes John learns, we need to calculate the total class hours and then figure out how many recipes he can learn based on those hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of class hours.**

John's class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each session, and it lasts for 6 weeks.

\[
\text{Total class hours} = 4 \times 2 \times 6 = 48 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many recipes he learns.**

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class hours by the number of hours per recipe.

\[
\text{Number of recipes} = \frac{48}{1.5} = 32

"To find out how many math teachers there are, we first need to determine the number of history teachers. Given that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90
\]

Since the rest of the teachers are math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
\]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[
\text{Total sleeping time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the amount of money each person has based on the given relationships.

First, we know that Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what Aurelia has, so we calculate Kassidy's money as follows:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so we calculate Rayna's money as:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we find the total amount of money they have together:

\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Aurelia's money} + \text{Kassidy's money} + \text{Rayna's money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they share this total equally among the three of them, each person will get:

\[
\text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we start by noting the total number of good days Christina had over the 30 days, which is 12. We then account for the distribution of these good days over the three periods:

- The first 8 days had 8 good days.
- The second 8 days had 0 good days.
- The third 8 days had 0 good days.

This accounts for \(8 + 0 + 0 = 8\) good days. We are also informed that the next three days (days 29, 30, and 31) had 2 good days (1 good and 1 neutral).

Thus, the total number of good days is \(8 + 2 = 10\). Since Christina had 12 good days in total, the number of good days left in the month is \(12 - 10 = 2\).

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Let's denote the number of books Sally has as \( S \).

According to the problem, Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, which can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of books Janey has} = 2S + 3 \]

We are given that Janey has 21 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find \( S \), we need to solve this equation step by step.

First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books.

Therefore, the bamboo will be 600 inches tall in \(\boxed{12}\) days."
"To determine the total number of toys James needs, we'll break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs, meaning he has 1 toy per dog.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs 8 more toys to have one toy per dog. Therefore, he needs 8 toys initially.
3. After buying the toys, the number of dogs in the shelter becomes 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (additional dogs) = 12 dogs.
4. Since he needs 1 toy per dog, he now needs 12 toys.
5. When James comes back again, 3 dogs have gone, so the number of dogs left is 12 - 3 = 9 dogs.
6. Since he needs 1 toy per dog, he now needs 9 toys.

Adding up all the toys he needs:
- Initially, he needed 8 toys.
- After buying the toys, he needed 12 toys.
- When he came back again, he needed 9 toys.

The total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 + 9 = 29\).

"To determine by how much the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults will exceed the maximum load of the elevator, we start by calculating the total weight of the group.

First, we calculate the total weight of the 8 adults:
\[ 8 \times 80 \text{ kg} = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Next, we add Jack's weight to the total weight of the adults:
\[ 640 \text{ kg} + 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

Therefore, the total weight will exceed the maximum load by:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Given the relationships provided in the problem, we start by using the information that Katarina has 68 cookies, which is 5 less than Max. Therefore, we can express Max's cookies as follows:

\[ K = M - 5 \]
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, we know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. Thus, we can express the Cookie Monster's cookies as:

\[ M = C + 12 \]
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Additionally, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so we can express Summer's cookies as:

\[ S = M + 23 \]
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, we sum the cookies each person has to find the total number of cookies:

\[ K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 \]

Calculating the sum:

\[ 68 + 73 = 141 \]
\[ 141 + 61 = 202 \]
\[ 202 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:

\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"To find the original length of the dress, we start with the equation derived from the problem statement:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
"To determine the total time Chris took to mow his lawn, we need to consider the time taken for each half of the lawn in both ""turtle"" and ""rabbit"" modes.

First, we convert the time taken in ""turtle"" mode to minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode takes 1 hour to mow the entire lawn.
- 1 hour = 60 minutes.

Next, we convert the time taken in ""rabbit"" mode to minutes:
- ""Rabbit"" mode takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode, we calculate the time for each half:
- Time taken for the first half (in ""turtle"" mode) = 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.
- Time taken for the second half (in ""rabbit"" mode) = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we sum the times for both halves to find the total time taken:
- Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes.

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

\[
\boxed{50}

"To find out how many cookies are left in the box, we start by calculating the total number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda. Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, which is \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies baked is \(30 + 60 = 90\).

Next, we account for the cookies that Greta and Celinda eat. They eat 10 cookies, so we subtract these from the total number of cookies baked:

\[ 90 - 10 = 80 \]

Thus, the number of cookies left in the box is 80."
"Let's denote the age of one of the twins as \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets as \( Tr \).

Given:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = Tr + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \).

Simplifying the second equation:
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Substitute \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substitute \( Tr = 6 \) back into the equation \( T = Tr + 7 \):

"To solve the problem, we start by determining the cost of one candy. Given that five lollipops cost $2.00 (since each lollipop costs $0.40), and the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20, we can find the cost of one candy by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost and then dividing by the number of candies.

The cost of four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Thus, the cost of one candy is:
\[ c = \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

"To find out how many coins Rong and Neil have after ten years, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month:**
   Rong saves 20 coins per month.

2. **Determine the number of coins Neil saves per month:**
   Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:
   \[
   20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of coins each saves over ten years:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
   \[
   10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
   \]
   Rong saves:
   \[
   20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
   \]
   Neil saves:
   \[
   28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
   \]

4. **Sum the total coins saved by both Rong and Neil:**
   The total number of coins saved by both is:
   \[
   2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins}
   \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5760}

"To solve the problem, we start by calculating the cost of the vaccines. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, each costing $20.

\[
\text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we denote the cost of the heartworm check as \( x \). According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, we can write:

\[
x = 0.6 \times (\text{Total bill})
\]

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[
\text{Total bill} = 40 + x
\]

Since \( x = 0.6 \times (\text{Total bill}) \), we substitute \( x \) in the total bill equation:

\[
x = 0.6 \times (40 + x)
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0.6 \times 40 + 0.6x
\]

\[
x = 24 + 0.6x
\]

Subtract \( 0.6x \) from both sides:

\[
x - 0.6x = 24
\]

\[
0.4x = 24
\]

Divide both sides by 0.4:

\[
x = \frac{24}{0.4} = 60
\]

So, the cost of the heartworm check is $60. Now, calculate the total bill:

\[
\text{Total bill} = 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[
\text{Amount left} = 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we'll calculate the cost of each type of fruit and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - Each crate contains 5 bananas.
   - The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple, and since one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each crate contains 12 apples.
   - The price of one apple is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Each crate contains 7 oranges.
   - The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana, and since one banana costs $1.0, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - Summing the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges:
   \[
   5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0
   \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32.0}\)."
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to calculate the number of each color of square on the comforter and then sum these numbers to find the total number of squares.

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Given: 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - Given: 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Calculation: \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) blue squares.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - Given: 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Calculation: \( 18 + 6 = 24 \) green squares.

4. **White Squares:**
   - Given: 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Calculation: \( 24 - 12 = 12 \) white squares.

Next, we sum the number of each color of square to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68 \text{ squares}
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, each square has an area of 1 square foot. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is:
\[
68 \text{ square feet}
\]

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"To determine the number of additional chairs needed, we start by calculating the total number of chairs required for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, making a total of:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \text{ people} \]

Next, we know the restaurant has 8 high chairs, and it has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs} \]

Adding the high chairs and regular chairs together gives the total number of chairs currently available:

\[ 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} + 8 \text{ (high chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs currently available from the total number of people:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \text{ chairs} \]

Thus, the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we start by calculating the number of bucks, which is 50 percent of the total deer. Given there are 50 deer in the field:

\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50\% \times 50 = 0.50 \times 50 = 25 \]

Next, we determine how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points:

\[ \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8-point bucks is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total points collected by the class, we start by calculating the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam** has collected 50 points.
2. **Betty** collected 30% more points than Adam. Therefore, Betty's points are:
   \[
   50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Marta** collected 3 times more points than Tom. Since Tom has 30 points, Marta's points are:
   \[
   3 \times 30 = 90
   \]
4. **Tom** has 30 points.

Now, summing up the points collected by all students:
\[
50 + 65 + 90 + 30 = 235
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:
\[
400 - 235 = 165
\]

Thus, the class is missing \(\boxed{165}\) points to go on the trip."
"To determine the number of great grand-babies, we can use the concept of exponential growth. Starting with Great Grandma Jones, we have:

1. **Great Grandma Jones has three children.**
   - This can be represented as \(3^1\).

2. **Each of her children has three children of their own (grandchildren).**
   - Since there are 3 children, and each has 3 grandchildren, this can be represented as \(3^2\).

3. **Each of these grandchildren has three children of their own (great grand-babies).**
   - Since there are \(3^2\) grandchildren, and each has 3 great grand-babies, this can be represented as \(3^3\).

Thus, the total number of great grand-babies is \(3^3\).

Calculating \(3^3\):
\[
3^3 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27
\]

Therefore, the number of great grand-babies is 27."
"Greta's total paycheck is $2400.00. She allocates 50% of her paycheck to her retirement account, which amounts to:

\[ 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

After funding her retirement account, the remaining amount is:

\[ 2400 - 1200 = 1200 \]

Next, she uses 20% of her original paycheck for her monthly car payment, which is:

\[ 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

Subtracting the car payment from the remaining amount after retirement contributions gives:

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720.00.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of pairs of pencils in the box, we start with the total capacity of the box, which is 20 pencils. Given that 4 pencils are missing, we calculate the number of pencils currently in the box as follows:

\[
20 - 4 = 16
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box. Since each pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils in the box by 2:

\[
16 \div 2 = 8
\]

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we start by calculating the total number of fireworks in the display. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each:

\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ fireworks} \]

"To determine the capacity of Gary's truck, we start by noting the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, and Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, which means Gordy's truck can haul:

\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Given that the combined capacity of the three trucks is 11,600 pounds, we can set up the following equation to find the capacity of Gary's truck, denoted as \( G \):

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G = 11600 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 8800 + G = 11600 \]

To isolate \( G \), we subtract 8800 from both sides:

\[ G = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G = 2800 \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2800} \]"
"To determine the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of dumplings each female ate:**
   Each female ate 3 dumplings.

2. **Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:**
   There are 6 females, and each ate 3 dumplings.
   \[
   \text{Total dumplings eaten by females} = 6 \times 3 = 18

"To determine the total number of hours required for the firefighters to reach their goal of $6300, we start by noting that they have already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. This means they need to raise an additional $4200 to meet their goal.

Given that they raise an equal amount each hour, we calculate the amount raised per hour:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we find out how many more hours are needed to raise the remaining $4200:
\[ \text{Number of additional hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Adding the initial 3 hours to the additional hours gives us the total number of hours required:
\[ \text{Total number of hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal is:
\[ 9 \]

The correct answer is:

"To find the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
   - 80% of this 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Calculate 80% of 40%:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 = 32\%
     \]

2. **Determine the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total percentage of water used by Colorado City is 40%.
   - Subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes (32%) from the total percentage used by Colorado City:
     \[

"To determine the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we first calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so the production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).
- In 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so the production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).
- In 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Adding the total quarts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours:

   - Left foot tap rate: 200 taps per minute
   - Combined tap rate: \(200 + 200 = 400\) taps per minute
   - Time with arms raised: 2 minutes
   - Total taps during this period: \(400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps}\)

3. **Total number of taps:**
   - Total taps: \(1650 \text{ taps} + 800 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps}\)

Therefore, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and then subtract this from the potential damage to his car.

1. **Fine for unauthorized road maintenance:** $120
2. **Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt:** Each bucket costs $25, so 3 buckets cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Adding these costs together gives the total cost for Ron to fix the pothole:
\[ 120 + 75 = 195 \]

The potential damage to his car if the pothole is not fixed is $450. To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential damage:
\[ 450 - 195 = 255 \]

Therefore, Ron saves:
\[ \boxed{255} \]"
"To determine the number of chairs left in the restaurant, we start with the initial counts:

- The restaurant initially has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs, making a total of \(170 + 23 = 193\) chairs.

Next, we account for the chairs sent to the carpenter for repair:

- 20 normal chairs were sent for repair, leaving \(170 - 20 = 150\) normal chairs.
- 13 baby chairs were sent for repair, leaving \(23 - 13 = 10\) baby chairs.

Adding the remaining normal and baby chairs together gives us the total number of chairs left:

\[150 + 10 = 160\]

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left. The final numerical answer is 160."
"To determine the number of slices of pizza left, we start by calculating the total number of slices ordered. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Then, we calculate the slices eaten by the two remaining friends. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends, we get the total number of slices eaten:

\[ 24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices} \]

Finally, the number of slices left is the total number of slices minus the number of slices eaten:

\[ 60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is:

\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To find the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we start by noting the time taken by the cat, which is 30 minutes. The dog takes \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time the cat takes, so the time for the dog is:

\[
\text{Time for the dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the average time by adding the times taken by the cat and the dog and then dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given information: the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches, which is 10 inches more than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as \( x \) inches. The relationship can be expressed by the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

To isolate \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( 10 \) inches. 

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total number of windows Hannah smashes, we start by calculating the number of windows in the students' cars and the teachers' cars separately.

First, we calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars:
\[ 64 \text{ students' cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars:
\[ 32 \text{ teachers' cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we calculate the number of windows smashed from the students' cars:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

Therefore, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is:
\[ 112 \]"
"To find the percentage of blue spools of thread, we start by calculating the total number of spools:

Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green)
Total spools = 150

Next, we calculate the total number of blue spools:

Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue)
Total blue spools = 60

Now, we determine the percentage of blue spools:

Percentage of blue spools = (Total blue spools / Total spools) * 100
Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100

Simplifying the fraction:

\[
\frac{60}{150} = 0.4
\]

Multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage:

\[
0.4 \times 100 = 40\%
\]

Therefore, the percentage of blue spools of thread is 40%.

The final answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we proceed as follows:

1. Initially, there are 5000 people lined up.
2. By midday, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people have voted:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \text{ people voted by midday.}
   \]
3. The number of people remaining after midday is:
   \[
   5000 - 2000 = 3000 \text{ people remaining.}
   \]
4. By 16:00, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people have voted:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \text{ people voted by 16:00.}
   \]
5. The number of people who did not vote by 16:00 is:
   \[
   3000 - 2000 = 1000 \text{ people.}
   \]

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \( 1000 \)."
"To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we start by calculating the total number of pieces of gum he will chew in that period. Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so over 30 days, he will chew:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum are required to get 120 pieces. Since each pack contains 15 pieces of gum, the number of packs needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we start by calculating the total number of smores required. Each of the 9 kids wants 2 smores, and each of the 6 adults wants 1 smore. Therefore, the total number of smores is:

\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} + 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 18 + 6 = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we need to find out how many graham cracker bases are required. Since each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 smores, the number of sleeves needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Given that each box contains 3 sleeves, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

Therefore, the number of boxes of graham crackers needed is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and using the given relationships to express the ages in terms of Dora's age.

Given:
- Dora's age = 15 years
- Dora's father's age = 8 more than twice Dora's age
- Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4

First, calculate Dora's father's age:
\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, calculate Dora's mother's age:
\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:

Thus, the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying is \(\boxed{17}\) pounds."
"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we start by calculating the votes for candidate A, who got 20% of the total votes. Given there are 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the votes for candidate B, who received 50% more votes than candidate A. This means:

\[ \text{Additional votes for candidate B} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

So, the total votes for candidate B are:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, to find the votes for candidate C, we subtract the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Boris initially has 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has \(100 - 23 = 77\) apples. When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Boris's apples become \(100 - 10 = 90\) and Beck's apples become \(77 + 10 = 87\). The difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck now is \(90 - 87 = 3\).

Therefore, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we'll calculate the total water used for each type of cube and then subtract this from the initial amount of water.

First, we calculate the water used for the giant cubes:
- Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
- Total water used for giant cubes: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

Next, we calculate the water used for the medium cubes:
- Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
- Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
- Total water used for medium cubes: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

Then, we calculate the water used for the small cubes:
- Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
- Peter makes 8 small cubes.
- Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we sum the water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used: \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
- Initial amount of water: 32 ounces.
- Water left: \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine how many more books Clara has than Alice, we start by finding out how many books Steven has. Given that Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

Solving for Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books Alice has, knowing that Alice has 6 more books than Steven:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total amount of money Cecelia spent, we start by determining the cost of a half-gallon jar. Given that a gallon jar costs $5 and is $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

1. **Cost of 10-gallon jars:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 10-gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of 16 half-gallon jars:**

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the total number of students and the number of students with specific hobbies.

1. **Total number of students**: 50
2. **Students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Students who like to play basketball**: 5

The rest of the students like to either play video games or play music. Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games or play music is:
\[ 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \]

Given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, we have:
\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Since the total number of students who like to play video games or play music is 35, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play music from 35:
\[ V = 35 - M = 35 - 10 = 25 \]

Thus, the number of students who like to play video games is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Initially, Jeremy saw 12 birds. When he threw a stone, 1/3 of the birds, which is 4 birds, were scared away. This leaves 12 - 4 = 8 birds. After that, 20 more birds joined the backyard. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is 8 + 20 = 28. 

The final numerical answer is 28."
"To find the number of boys in each class, we start by determining the number of students in each class. Given that the total number of students in the two classes is 80 and each class has the same number of students, we divide 80 by 2:

\[
\text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 40 students are girls. Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we calculate 40% of 40:

\[
\text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
\]

To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:

\[
\text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
\]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."

"To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we start by summing up the total number of animals she has to groom this week. She has:

- 8 dogs
- 5 cats
- 3 birds
- 12 horses

Adding these together gives:
\[ 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \]

Melissa has 28 animals to groom over the course of the week. Since she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days, we need to divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

So, we perform the division:
\[ \frac{28}{7} = 4 \]

Therefore, Melissa will groom 4 animals each day of the week.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Mark's profit, we start by calculating the total cost of the packs he bought. He purchased 3 packs at $1800 each:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total value of the cards he received. He got one card worth $4000, another worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50:

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 cards worth $50 each} = 30 \times 50 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding these values together gives the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of the cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

"To determine the savings, we first calculate the total cost for each amusement park.

For the first amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $26, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adults is \(2 \times 26 = 52\).
- The cost for each child is $12, and there are 2 children, so the total cost for children is \(2 \times 12 = 24\).
- Therefore, the total cost for the first amusement park is \(52 + 24 = 76\).

For the second amusement park:
- The cost for each adult is $14, and there are 2 adults, so the total cost for adults is \(2 \times 14 = 28\).
- The cost for each child is $10, and there are 2 children, so the total cost for children is \(2 \times 10 = 20\).
- Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is \(28 + 20 = 48\).

The savings by choosing the second amusement park over the first is \(76 - 48 = 28\).

Thus, the amount saved is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To determine the weekly savings, we first calculate the daily savings by comparing the cost of buying tomatoes from the old vendor to the new vendor.

1. **Daily cost from the old vendor:**
   - Cost per tomato from the old vendor = $0.5
   - Number of tomatoes bought per day = 500
   - Daily cost from the old vendor = \( 500 \times 0.5 = \$250 \)

2. **Daily cost from the new vendor:**
   - Cost per tomato from the new vendor = $0.4
   - Number of tomatoes bought per day = 500
   - Daily cost from the new vendor = \( 500 \times 0.4 = \$200 \)

3. **Daily savings:**
   - Daily savings = Daily cost from the old vendor - Daily cost from the new vendor
   - Daily savings = \( 250 - 200 = \$50 \)

4. **Weekly savings:**
   - Number of days in a week = 7

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of marbles Sean has, which is given as 56. According to the problem, Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Therefore, we calculate the number of marbles Carl has as follows:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we need to determine the number of marbles Cal has. The problem states that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. Thus, we can express the number of marbles Cal has in terms of the number of marbles Sean has:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of marbles Cal has} \]

Rearranging this equation to solve for the number of marbles Cal has, we get:

\[ \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Finally, to find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have, we add the number of marbles each has:

\[ \text{Combined number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have is 336."
"To determine how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups from 54 students, we first need to understand the requirement for equal-sized groups.

Given:
- Total students: 54
- Desired number of groups: 12

We calculate the number of students per group if we form 12 groups:
\[
\text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group}
\]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to form 12 groups of equal size with 54 students. Therefore, we need to form 6 groups instead.

Next, we calculate the number of students per group if we form 6 groups:
\[
\text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group}
\]

Since 9 is a whole number, it is possible to form 6 groups of 9 students each.

To find out how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups:
\[
\text{Number of additional groups needed} = 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ groups}
\]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is 6.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months, we start by calculating the number of chairs rented in one 4-week month.

First, we calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends in one 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month: \(60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 20 \text{ days} = 1200 \text{ chairs}\).
- Total chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month: \(100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ chairs}\).

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
\[1200 \text{ chairs} + 800 \text{ chairs} = 2000 \text{ chairs}\].

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
\[2000 \text{ chairs} \times 2 = 4000 \text{ chairs}\].

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:

"To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we start with the total monthly cost of $100. Since there are 4 roommates, we divide the monthly cost by 4 to find out how much each roommate pays each month:

\[
\text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
\]

Next, to find the annual cost per roommate, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[
\text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300
\]

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we start by calculating the total number of each item he initially sent.

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses, which is \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.
- 4 dozen plates, which is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

Next, we account for the items that were returned broken:
- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

To find out how many glasses and plates are left, we subtract the broken items from the total items sent:
- Remaining glasses: \(96 - 10 = 86\).
- Remaining plates: \(48 - 6 = 42\).

Finally, we sum the remaining glasses and plates to get the total number of items Jeff has now:
- Total remaining items: \(86 + 42 = 128\).

Therefore, the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is \(\boxed{128}\)."
"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end, we will follow the steps systematically:

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 \)

Thus, by the end, Lorraine has 107 buttons. The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{107}\)."
"To find out how many matches Joey played in one week, we sum the matches played each day:

- On Monday, Joey played 2 matches.
- On Friday, Joey played 1 match.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches.

Adding these together:
\[ 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables. Let \( x \) represent the number of votes against the new regulation. Consequently, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which gives us the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

Thus, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{22}

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we will calculate the number of students for each size and then sum them up.

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - Number of students needing XS shirts = 11

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of students needing S shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of students needing M shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of students needing L shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of students needing XL shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size of shirt to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
\text{Total shirts} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75
\]

Therefore, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"To find the price after a 5% discount on a $140 item, we first calculate the discount amount:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 5\% \times 140 = 0.05 \times 140 = 7 \]

\[ \text{Price after discount} = 140 - 7 = 133 \]

Therefore, the final amount you will pay after the discount is:

\[ \boxed{133} \]"
"To determine the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we start by calculating the total number of songs across all playlists. Given that each playlist contains 300 songs and there are 20 playlists, the total number of songs is:

\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Next, we know that each song is 10 hours long. Therefore, the total number of hours for all the songs combined is:

\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is:

\[ \boxed{60000} \]"
"To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we start by calculating the number of people who think horse #2 will win. 

20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ people} \]

After those who think horse #2 will win, the remaining number of people is:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people} \]

Next, 60% of these remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ people} \]

The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. To find out how many people this is, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the remaining 40 people:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given information. Two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one-third of these Pomeranians are girls. We know there are 6 Pomeranian girls.

First, let's denote the total number of puppies Jana has as \( P \). According to the problem, the number of Pomeranian puppies is:
\[ \frac{2}{3}P \]

Since one-third of the Pomeranian puppies are girls, the number of Pomeranian girls can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = \frac{2}{9}P \]

We are given that there are 6 Pomeranian girls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation by isolating \( P \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

Thus, Jana has a total of 27 puppies. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 27 \]"
"Jayden initially had $70 from selling pictures. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. Adding this to his initial amount, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200, so the amount he still needs is $200 - $115 = $85. Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

Given:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so it needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so it needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

   - Therefore, for 4 liters of juice, the amount of oranges needed is:
     \[
     4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kilograms/liter} = 20 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges:**
   - Each kilogram of oranges costs $3.
   - Therefore, the cost for 20 kilograms of oranges is:
     \[
     20 \text{ kilograms} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, Sam would have to spend **60 dollars** to make 4 liters of juice."
"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given information:

1. In one hour, Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed.
2. Ezra read 300 books in that hour.
3. Ezra decided to read 150 more books.

First, we determine how many books Ahmed read. Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2A = 300 \]
Solving for \( A \):
\[ A = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]
So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Next, we calculate the total number of books Ezra read:
\[ 300 \text{ (initial books)} + 150 \text{ (additional books)} = 450 \text{ books} \]

Now, we find the total number of books read by both Ezra and Ahmed:
\[ 450 \text{ (Ezra's books)} + 150 \text{ (Ahmed's books)} = 600 \text{ books} \]

Therefore, the total number of books they read altogether is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"To determine Tanya's earnings for teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we'll break down the calculations step by step.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each day.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ \text{Base earnings} = 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Since she teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3 classes, she qualifies for the additional $5 per day:
\[ \text{Total earnings for Monday} = \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each day.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not qualify for the additional $5 per day since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ \text{Base earnings} = 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not qualify for the additional $5 per day, her total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \$60 \]

**Total earnings for both days:**
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total earnings for Monday} + \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \$305 + \$60 = \$365 \]

Thus, Tanya earned a total of \(\boxed{365}\) dollars for these two days of teaching."
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we start by calculating the total sales for each type of scent.

For vanilla scents:
\[ 5 \text{ vanilla scents/sale} \times 5 \text{ sales} = 25 \text{ vanilla scents} \]

For fruity scents:
\[ 2 \text{ fruity scents/sale} \times 2 \text{ sales} = 4 \text{ fruity scents} \]

Next, we find the difference between the number of vanilla scents sold and the number of fruity scents sold:
\[ 25 \text{ vanilla scents} - 4 \text{ fruity scents} = 21 \text{ more vanilla scents sold} \]

Therefore, the number of vanilla scents sold is 21 more than the number of fruity scents sold. The final answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"To determine the price per ear of corn that Bennet needs to sell to reach a total of $135, we start by calculating the revenue from the eggplants. Bennet sells 20 eggplants at $3 each, so the revenue from the eggplants is:

\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much more money Bennet needs to make to reach his goal of $135. This can be calculated as:

\[ 135 - 60 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find the price per ear of corn, we divide the remaining amount by the number of ears of corn:

\[ \frac{75}{25} = 3 \text{ dollars per ear} \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for \(\boxed{3}\) dollars."
"To determine the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we start by calculating the total available time over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we calculate the time she spends playing video games, which is one-third of the remaining time:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Subtracting the time spent on video games from the remaining time gives us the time spent playing soccer:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

"To determine how many pencils Anthony kept, we start with the initial number of pencils he had, which is 50.

First, Anthony gave half of his pencils to Brandon. Therefore, the number of pencils given to Brandon is:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
\]

After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:

\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, Anthony gave 3/5 of the remaining 25 pencils to Charlie. The number of pencils given to Charlie is:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the return trip is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back home is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the number of wheels left after Henry assembles the cars and motorcycles, we start by calculating the total number of wheels required.

First, we calculate the wheels needed for the cars:
\[ 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

Next, we calculate the wheels needed for the motorcycles:
\[ 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Given that Henry has 650 wheels, we subtract the total wheels required from the total wheels available to find the number of wheels left:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

Thus, the number of wheels left is:
\[ 276 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{276} \]"

"To determine the cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of movies in series:
\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]

Next, we find the number of non-series movies:
\[ \text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Then, we determine the number of older movies among the non-series movies:
\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

The remaining non-series movies are not older:
\[ \text{Number of non-older non-series movies} = 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for each type of movie:
- Cost for series movies: \(200 \times 6 = 1200\)
- Cost for non-older non-series movies: \(240 \times 10 = 2400\)
- Cost for older movies: \(160 \times 5 = 800\)

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400 \]

Therefore, the total cost to replace the movies is:
\[ \boxed{4400} \]"

"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we can use the information provided to set up and solve an algebraic equation.

First, let's denote the total distance to the vacation spot as \( D \).

The family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. Therefore, the distance driven is:
\[ \text{Distance driven} = 50 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, the family hiked for 1.5 hours. The average speed when hiking is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half of the driving speed is:
\[ \frac{50 \, \text{miles/hour}}{2} = 25 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
Thus, the hiking speed is:
\[ 25 \, \text{miles/hour} - 5 \, \text{miles/hour} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \]
Therefore, the distance hiked is:
\[ \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

The total distance \( D \) to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
\[ D = 300 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 330 \, \text{miles} \]

Thus, the total distance to the vacation spot is 330 miles."
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we start by calculating the points each player earns based on the given conditions.

Ava's points:
- From jumping on enemies: \(10 \times 8 = 80\)
- From collecting berries: \(5 \times 3 = 15\)
- From finishing 4 seconds slower: \(30 \times (-4) = -120\)

Total score for Ava:
\[ 80 + 15 - 120 = -25 \]

Emma's points:
- From jumping on enemies: \(10 \times (E_E - (E_E + 8)) = 10 \times (-8) = -80\)
- From collecting berries: \(5 \times (B_E - (B_E + 3)) = 5 \times (-3) = -15\)
- From finishing 4 seconds slower: \(30 \times (T_E - (T_E + 4)) = 30 \times (-4) = -120\)

Total score for Emma:
\[ -80 - 15 - 120 = -215 \]

The difference in their scores is:
\[ -25 - (-215) = -25 + 215 = 190 \]

Thus, the difference between their scores is \(\boxed{190}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by noting that two pizzas cost a total of 30 dollars each, which means together they cost 60 dollars. The total cost for all four pizzas is 64 dollars. Therefore, the combined cost of the remaining two pizzas is:

\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, each of the other two pizzas costs:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of rides they have on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
- They do this for 5 days.

So, the total number of rides on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, we calculate the number of rides they have on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) rides per day.
- They do this for 2 days.

So, the total number of rides on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given information and set up the equations based on the conditions provided.

We know that Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white. After buying more fish from the pet store, the total number of fish became 17. Let \( o \) represent the number of orange fish bought and \( w \) represent the number of white fish bought. Therefore, we have:
\[ o + w = 17 \]

After adding the new fish to his pond, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Next, substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2w + 5 + w = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now, substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

We can verify the solution:
- The total number of fish bought is \( o + w = 13 + 4 = 17 \).
- After adding the fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- The number of orange fish is indeed twice the number of white fish: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total distance Andy drives in a week:
   - Andy drives 5 miles one way.
   - He makes a round trip each day (5 miles * 2 = 10 miles/day).
   - He drives from Monday to Friday (5 days/week).
   - Therefore, the total distance driven in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days/week = 50 miles/week.

2. Calculate the amount of gas consumed in a week:
   - The car's fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon.
   - The total distance driven in a week is 50 miles.
   - Therefore, the gas consumed in a week is 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons/week.

3. Calculate the cost of the gas consumed in a week:
   - The price of gas is $3 per gallon.
   - The gas consumed in a week is 5 gallons.
   - Therefore, the cost of the gas consumed in a week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

Thus, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is $15."
"To determine the total amount of money Carrie spent for lunch, we start by calculating the value of the twenties and quarters she has.

Carrie has ten twenties, each worth $20. Therefore, the total value of the twenties is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie also has 140 quarters, each worth $0.25. Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Carrie spent all the quarters, which is $35. She also spent 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the amounts spent on quarters and twenties gives the total amount spent for lunch:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To determine the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his garden, we need to calculate the number of tomatoes and eggplants separately and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the number of tomatoes:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of eggplants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is:

\[
\boxed{142}

"To find out how many OLED TVs were sold, we start with the total sales of 40 TVs. We know that one-fourth of the sales are smart TVs and one-eighth are analog TVs. Let's calculate these first.

The number of smart TVs sold is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

The number of analog TVs sold is:
\[
\frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, to find the number of OLED TVs sold, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[
40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

Therefore, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine Jamie's total earnings for working 11 hours on last Tuesday, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and additional hours.

First, let's identify her regular hourly rate and the special hourly rate:
- Regular hourly rate: $20 per hour
- Special hourly rate: 150% of the regular hourly rate = 1.5 * $20 = $30 per hour

Next, we calculate the number of regular and additional hours worked:
- Total hours worked: 11 hours
- Regular hours: 8 hours
- Additional hours: 11 - 8 = 3 hours

Now, we calculate the earnings from the regular hours and the additional hours:
- Earnings from regular hours: 8 hours * $20/hour = $160
- Earnings from additional hours: 3 hours * $30/hour = $90

Finally, we sum the earnings from both types of hours to find the total earnings:

"To find out how much money Mike will have left after purchasing the jeans, we start by calculating the discounted price. The original price of the jeans is $40.00, and they are on sale for 25% off. The discount amount is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Discount amount} = 40.00 \times 0.25 = 10.00 \]

Subtracting the discount from the original price gives us the sale price:

\[ \text{Sale price} = 40.00 - 10.00 = 30.00 \]

Mike pays with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the sale price from the amount he paid:

\[ \text{Money left} = 50.00 - 30.00 = 20.00 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Mike will have left is:

\[ \boxed{20.00} \]"
"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of employees after three months:**
   - The company hires 20 new employees every month.
   - After three months, the number of new employees hired is \(20 \times 3 = 60\).
   - The initial number of employees is 200.
   - Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is \(200 + 60 = 260\).

2. **Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month:**
   - Each employee is paid $4000 per month.
   - The total salary paid to all employees each month is \(260 \times 4000 = 1040000\) dollars.

\]

Therefore, the total time they will be caroling is \(\boxed{540}\) seconds."
"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then their earnings for 20 hours.

First, let's find Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
1. **Initial hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, the raise:** $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, the raise:** $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Next, we calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours at each stage:
1. **Initial earnings (first 2 months):**
   \[
   10 \text{ hours/month} \times 2 \text{ months} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. **Earnings after the raise (first anniversary):**
   \[
   11.50 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 230 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up Billy's total earnings:
\[
400 \text{ dollars} + 230 \text{ dollars} = 630 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate Sally's hourly wage:
1. **Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's initial salary:**
   \[
   10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

We calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours:
\[
10.50 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 210 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
\[
630 \text{ dollars} - 210 \text{ dollars} = 420 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Billy will earn $420 more than Sally in 20 hours. The correct answer is:

"To determine how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we start by calculating the cost of the bread and the cost of the bagels separately.

First, the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf costs $2.
- Therefore, 3 loaves cost \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.

Next, the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, 2 bagels cost \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) dollars.

To find out how much more the bread costs than the bagels, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread:
- The difference is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

\]

Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's score:

\[
\text{Nikita's score} = 139 + 11 = 150
\]

Now, we add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together to find the total:

\[
\text{Total points} = 278 + 150 = 428
\]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To determine the total number of trees planted, we start by calculating the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

The school has 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

The school also has 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of trees planted by the students and teachers. Each student plants 1 tree:

"Bubbles currently has 14 stuffed animals. To achieve a 30% ratio of stuffed goats, we need to find the value of \( x \) such that \( x \) is 30% of the total number of stuffed animals after adding \( x \) goats.

Let's set up the equation:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Expanding and solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]
\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]
\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

Therefore, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats to achieve a 30% ratio of goats among all her stuffed animals. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach her goal of 30 hours, we first calculate the total hours she has already played. 

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since 2 weeks consist of \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days, the total hours played in the first 2 weeks is:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total hours played in the last week is:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the last week gives:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach her goal of 30 hours, we subtract the hours she has already played from her goal:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, Kris still needs to play \(\boxed{9}\) hours to earn the achievement."

"To find the overall pass rate for Janet's collection of results from Herbert Hoover Elementary School's annual standardized test, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's determine the pass rates for each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Pass rate} = \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \text{ or } 68\%
   \]

2. **Fourth-grade pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Pass rate} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \text{ or } 40\%
   \]

3. **Fifth-grade pass rate:**
   The fifth-grade pass rate is twice the fourth-grade pass rate:
   \[
   \text{Fifth-grade pass rate} = 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \text{ or } 80\%
   \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

   \]

Now, we sum the number of students who passed in all grades:

\[
\text{Total number of pass students} = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700
\]

The total number of students tested is:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000
\]

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \text{ or } 70\%

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we start by calculating the total number of glass chips he has. Since each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Given that it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we have:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we first calculate the total tea consumed by the students. 

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts of tea:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts of tea:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We know that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students drank. Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Thus, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many more butterscotch candies Dale needs to sell, we start with the following:

1. Dale initially ordered 100 candies.
2. He sold 150 candies, which means he ran out of his initial order and needed to order more.
3. Dale then ordered an additional 100 candies.
4. Now, Dale has a total of 200 candies (100 initial + 100 additional).

Since he has already sold 150 candies, the number of candies he still needs to sell is:
\[ 200 - 150 = 50 \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 more candies to sell all of his candy.

\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

3. For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

4. For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of petals initially:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

Rose then drops 1 flower from each type, which means she drops:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"John and DeSean bought a bag of 35 marshmallows. They each made 9 S'mores, using a total of \(9 + 9 = 18\) marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is \(18 + 3 = 21\). This leaves \(35 - 21 = 14\) marshmallows in the bag.

With 14 marshmallows remaining, and since each S'more requires one marshmallow, each of them can have \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) S'mores.

Thus, the number of S'mores each can have with the remaining marshmallows is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money used, we first need to calculate the total time played in minutes and then convert that into the number of quarters required.

The total time played is 4 hours, which is equivalent to:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time each person can play with one quarter:
- Jack can play for 20 minutes.
- Each of the two worse friends can play for half as long as Jack, which is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) minutes.
- The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is \( 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \) minutes.

Now, we sum the time played by each person:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes (Jack)} + 10 \text{ minutes (first worse friend)} + 10 \text{ minutes (second worse friend)} + 30 \text{ minutes (better friend)} = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

To find out how many quarters are needed to play for 240 minutes, we divide the total time played by the time one quarter allows:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes per quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses, we start by defining the variables based on the given relationships:

- Let \( S \) represent the amount of salt.
- Let \( O \) represent the amount of oil.
- Let \( F \) represent the amount of fragrance.
- Let \( C \) represent the amount of citrus zest.
- Let \( G \) represent the amount of sugar.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can substitute \( C \) with \( S \) and \( F \) with \( S \). Therefore, we have:
- \( O = 2S \)
- \( F = S \)
- \( C = S \)
- \( G = S \)

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation, we get:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil used, which is \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}

"To find out how much money John spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows, and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the total cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $500.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows.
- Each cow costs $1500.

\[
\text{Total cost of cows} = 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount of money John spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
4500

"To determine how many cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Number of Cars:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so Joe initially has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

2. **Cars Sold:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars. Therefore, the number of cars sold is \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

3. **Cars Given to His Mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold. Thus, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

4. **Remaining Cars:**
   - After selling 8 cars, Joe has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars left.
   - After giving away 16 cars, Joe has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars remaining.

Therefore, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is 16.

\[
\boxed{16}

"To find out how much each student raised, we start with the total amount raised by the charity, which is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations, leaving the students to raise the remaining amount. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

With 20 students working together, the amount each student raised is:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6250 \]"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we start by noting the time she spent walking each day. On the first day, she walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked for half the time of the first day, which is 4 hours.

Adding the hours from both days gives us:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{720}

"Let's denote the number of cards PJ has as \( P \). According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( P \):

\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( P \):

\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 3 \times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The cost per pound is $0.35.
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - Therefore, the cost for the weight of the book is \(4 \times 0.35 = 1.40\) dollars.
   - The cost per mile is $0.08.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - Therefore, the cost for the distance is \(20 \times 0.08 = 1.60\) dollars.
   - The total shipping cost is \(1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the refundable portion of the book's purchase price:**
   - The book cost $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - Therefore, the refundable amount is \(32 \times 0.75 = 24.00\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The total cost to Milly is the shipping cost plus the cost of the book.
   - The cost of the book is $32.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(32 + 3.00 = 35.00\) dollars.
   - The net loss is the total cost minus the refundable amount.
   - Therefore, the net loss is \(35.00 - 24.00 = 11.00\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"To determine how much money Roy has saved, we start by identifying the savings of each family member based on the given information.

First, we know Eva has saved $20.00. Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, so we calculate Anthony's savings as follows:
\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Next, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:
\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives Roy's total savings:
\[
\text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the kangaroos and the turtles, and how this affects the time it takes for the turtles to cover the same distance.

1. **Determine the total distance \( D \) traveled by the kangaroos:**
   - Given that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel the distance \( D \), and each kangaroo travels at a speed \( v \), the total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of each turtle:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - Let \( t \) be the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed in terms of the speed of the turtles and the time \( t \):
     \[
     D = 4 \left( \frac{v}{2} \right) t = 2vt
     \]
   - Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
     \[
     54v = 2vt
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

The final numerical answer is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of clay dishes each person made in terms of Kora's dishes. Given that Kora made 20 clay dishes, we can express the number of dishes made by Rory and Jada in terms of Kora's dishes.

1. **Kora's Clay Dishes**: \( K = 20 \)
2. **Rory's Clay Dishes**: Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, so \( R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 \)
3. **Jada's Clay Dishes**: Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, so \( J = 2 \times R = 2 \times 40 = 80 \)

To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together, we sum their individual counts:
\[
\text{Total} = J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140
\]

Thus, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is \(\boxed{140}\)."
"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we start by calculating the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old one. The original price is $600, and the reduction is $200, so the new price is:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we start by calculating the current milk production with the 3 cows. Each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, so:

\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

The farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The additional milk needed is:

\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the number of additional cows required to produce the additional 10 liters of milk is:

\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{5}{6} \times 12 = 10 \) millimeters

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) millimeters

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) millimeters

Now, we sum the remaining lengths of the three glue sticks:
\[ 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \]

Thus, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is \( 20 \) millimeters.

The final numerical answer is \( 20 \)."

"While on vacation in Bali, Thea bought a hat from a craftsman worth $70. She gave the craftsman four $20 bills. To find out how much change she received, we start by calculating the total amount she gave:

\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Subtracting the cost of the hat from the total amount given:

\[ 80 - 70 = 10 \]

Therefore, the change Thea received is $10."
"To determine how much money Craig has left, we start by calculating his initial amount of money. Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, so:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the squirt guns. Craig buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each:

\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of the packs of water balloons. Craig buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding the cost of the squirt guns and the packs of water balloons gives us the total amount spent:

\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Craig has leaves us with:

\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Craig has left is:

\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Given the problem, let's break it down algebraically:

1. Jack has 60 dishes, denoted as \( D = 60 \).
2. Jack has twice as many dishes as socks, so \( D = 2S \). Substituting \( D = 60 \) gives \( 60 = 2S \), solving for \( S \) yields \( S = 30 \). Thus, Jack has 30 socks.
3. Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
4. Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, we calculate the total number of items they have together:
- Jack has \( 30 \) socks and \( 60 \) dishes, totaling \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) items.
- Peter has \( 60 \) socks and \( 30 \) dishes, totaling \( 60 + 30 = 90 \) items.

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is \( 90 + 90 = 180 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of students good at math, we can use the principles of set theory. Let's denote the total number of students as \( N \), the number of students good at math only as \( M_{\text{only}} \), the number of students good at English only as \( E_{\text{only}} \), and the number of students good at both math and English as \( B \).

Given:
- \( N = 20 \)
- \( M_{\text{only}} = 5 \)
- \( E_{\text{only}} = 8 \)
- The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

First, we calculate the number of students good at both math and English:
\[ B = N - (M_{\text{only}} + E_{\text{only}}) = 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 \]

Next, to find the total number of students good at math, we add the number of students who are good at math only to the number of students who are good at both math and English:
\[ M = M_{\text{only}} + B = 5 + 7 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we first calculate the total time required for one group to perform, including the time for setup, performance, and exit. Each group takes:

- 2 minutes to get on stage
- 6 minutes to perform
- 2 minutes to exit the stage

Adding these times together gives:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes per group} \]

Next, we account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total concert time is 2 hours, which is:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtracting the intermission time from the total concert time:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we determine how many groups can fit into the remaining 110 minutes:
\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

Therefore, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we start with the formula for simple interest:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times R \times T \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% = 2.25\) (as a decimal)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

Let's compute this:
\[ 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]
\[ 675 \times 3 = 2025 \]

So, the simple interest earned over 3 years is $2025.

Next, we add the simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is:
\[ \boxed{2325} \]"
"To determine how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts without collars, we start with the given numbers:

- Total white shirts: 40
- White shirts with collars: 40 / 2 = 20
- White shirts without collars: 40 - 20 = 20
- Total floral shirts: 50
- Floral shirts with buttons: 20
- Floral shirts without buttons: 50 - 20 = 30

Now, we compare the number of floral shirts without buttons to the number of white shirts without collars:

- Floral shirts without buttons: 30
- White shirts without collars: 20

The difference is:
30 - 20 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts without collars. The final answer is 10."
"To determine the earnings from selling the eggs, we start by calculating the number of trays needed. Given that each tray holds 30 eggs and the farmer has 900 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the capacity of each tray:

\[
\frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray. Each tray is sold for $2.5, so:

\[
30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the farmer will earn \(\boxed{75}\) dollars."
"To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we start with the initial counts and subtract the goats sold.

- Initially, Farm X has 55 goats and Farm Y has 45 goats.
- Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X, leaving \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats.
- He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) goats, leaving \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats.

Adding the remaining goats from both farms, we get \(45 + 25 = 70\) goats.

Therefore, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To find the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes, we start by calculating the total number of pairs he buys in a year. Given that he buys 2 pairs of shoes each month and there are 12 months in a year, the total number of pairs he buys in a year is:

\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

Next, we know that he spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average amount he spends on each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:

\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

Therefore, the average amount James pays for each pair of shoes is:

\[ 110 \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total cost of buying 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food with the given discount, we proceed as follows:

1. **Cost of 3 baskets of green food:**
   Each basket of green food costs $25.
   \[
   3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of 3 baskets of red food with the discount:**
   Each basket of red food costs $18, but you get $2 off for each basket.
   \[
   18 - 2 = 16 \text{ dollars per basket}
   \]
   \[
   3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost:**
   Add the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food.

"To determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, we start by calculating the number of rooms to be cleaned. One-half of 90 rooms is 45 rooms.

Next, we calculate the total time required to clean these 45 rooms. Given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time in minutes is \(45 \times 20 = 900\) minutes.

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time in hours is \( \frac{900}{60} = 15 \) hours.

Therefore, the number of hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms is 15 hours."
"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we will calculate the number of homes built each year and then sum them up.

1. **First Year:**
   The town builds 12 homes.
   \[
   \text{Homes built in the first year} = 12
   \]

2. **Second Year:**
   The town builds three times the number of homes built in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Homes built in the second year} = 3 \times 12 = 36
   \]

3. **Third Year:**
   The town counts the total number of homes built in the first two years and then doubles this total.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the given relationships:

- Let \( B \) be the age of the brother.
- Let \( S \) be the age of the sister.
- Let \( M \) be the age of the mom.
- Let \( Y \) be the age of the younger person (you).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. You are three years younger than your brother: \( Y = B - 3 \).
2. You are two years older than your sister: \( Y = S + 2 \).
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

First, we express the sister's age in terms of the brother's age:
\[ S = Y - 2 \]

Next, we substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now we have:
\[ Y = B - 3 \]
\[ S = B - 5 \]

We substitute these into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now we can find \( Y \):
\[ Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, you are 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required. With 27 students and each student needing 2 glue sticks, the total number of glue sticks needed is:

\[ 27 \times 2 = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to meet this need. We divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to have enough glue sticks, we round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day, we follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   - On the first day, the amount of water is 4000 gallons.

2. **Amount of Water on the Second Day:**
   - After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles.
   - Therefore, on the second day, the amount of water is \( 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \) gallons.

3. **Amount of Water on the Third Day:**
   - On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons.
   - Therefore, on the third day, the amount of water is \( 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \) gallons.

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons."
"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we can model the situation using exponential growth. Initially, there are 10 infected people. Each day, each infected person infects 6 others. This means the number of infected people triples each day (since 1 infected person infects 6 others, and there are 10 initial infected people, the total number of new infections each day is \(10 \times 6 = 60\), and this process repeats each day).

Let's calculate the number of infected people step by step:

**Day 0 (initial state):**
- Number of infected people: 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, resulting in \(10 \times 6 = 60\) new infections.
- Total number of infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, resulting in \(70 \times 6 = 420\) new infections.
- Total number of infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, resulting in \(490 \times 6 = 2940\) new infections.
- Total number of infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"To find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we start by calculating Rafaela's total tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we multiply:

\[
40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we determine Julieta's total tips. The problem states that Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[
10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total tips gives us Julieta's total tips:

\[
800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta:

\[
800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is:

\[
\boxed{1520}

"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, which totals \(2 \times 3 = 6\) oranges. Her only son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is \(6 + 3 = 9\).

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:

\[12 - 9 = 3\]

Thus, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges. The correct answer is 3."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year.

1. **Claire's Badges:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges in a year.

2. **Amber's Badges:**
   - It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Since Claire earns a badge every month, Amber earns a badge every 2 months.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges in a year.

3. **Wendy's Badges:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges in a year.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber is \(36 - 6 = 30\).

Therefore, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

"Given that Gretchen has 70 gold coins and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can determine the number of silver coins by subtracting 30 from the number of gold coins. Therefore, the number of silver coins is:

\[ 70 - 30 = 40 \]

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

Thus, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we start by calculating the total number of burritos distributed to the students. There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos:

\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

Next, we subtract the 20 burritos that Mr. George ate from the 500 burritos distributed to the students:

\[ 500 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 480 \text{ burritos} \]

Finally, we subtract the 480 burritos distributed to the students and the 20 burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total of 600 burritos ordered:

\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 480 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 120 \text{ burritos} \]

"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we start by calculating the number of each type of car based on the given information.

1. **Red Cars:**
   The rink has 12 red cars.

2. **Green Cars:**
   The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]

3. **Blue Cars:**
   The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars to find the total number of these three types of cars:
\[
12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52
\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
75 - 52 = 23
\]

Thus, the number of yellow cars is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"Let's denote the number of books that Anne has as \( A \). According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have together is 85. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
(A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[
A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
3A + 37 = 85
\]

Subtract 37 from both sides to isolate the term with \( A \):

\[
3A = 48
\]

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( A \):

\[
A = 16
\]

Now, since Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books, we substitute \( A = 16 \) into the expression:

\[
A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28
\]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{28}

"To find the weight of the carrots, we start with the weight of the potatoes, which is 5 pounds. The sweet potatoes weigh 2 times as much as the potatoes, so the weight of the sweet potatoes is:

\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

The carrots weigh 3 pounds less than the sweet potatoes, so the weight of the carrots is:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots Daisy bought is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine how much Greg will spend on jello, we first calculate the total number of jello cups needed. Given that there are 30 kids and each kid should have 4 jello cups, the total number of jello cups required is:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we need to find out how many boxes of jello are required. Since one box of jello makes 10 jello cups, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25, so the total cost for 12 boxes is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Greg will spend on jello is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"

"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we start by calculating Madeline's and Keenan's monthly contributions based on the given information.

Given that Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 per month and Madeline pays 60% of this amount, we first calculate Madeline's monthly payment:

\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, Keenan's monthly payment is:

\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4:

For soda:
- Seven bottles cost $21.00.
- Therefore, the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

For water:
- Four bottles cost $8.00.
- Therefore, the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost for David's purchase:
- The cost for 3 bottles of soda is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
- The cost for 2 bottles of water is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
- Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Thus, the total amount David will spend is $13.00."
"To determine how much money David has left after buying 16 bolts, we start by calculating the total cost of the bolts. Each bolt costs $0.03, so for 16 bolts, the total cost is:

\[
16 \times 0.03 = 0.48
\]

David initially has $12.48. After spending $0.48 on the bolts, the amount of money he has left is:

\[
12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00
\]

Therefore, the final amount of money David has left is $12.00."
"To determine Ella's hourly rate, we divide her total earnings by the number of hours worked: \( \frac{33}{3} = 11 \) dollars per hour. 

Next, to find out how much she would earn for 12 hours of work, we multiply her hourly rate by 12: \( 11 \times 12 = 132 \) dollars.

Therefore, the amount Ella would earn after 12 hours is \( 132 \) dollars. 

The correct answer is \( \boxed{132} \)."
"Paul initially has 52 marbles. His friend gives him 28 more, making the total:

\[ 52 + 28 = 80 \]

Paul then loses \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his marbles. The number of marbles he loses is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \]

Subtracting the lost marbles from the total gives:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Paul has left is 60."

"To determine the cost Isaias incurred to buy the chickens, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell. He plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of his 300 chickens:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
\]

2. Determine the total revenue from selling these 180 chickens at $50 per chicken:
\[
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
\]

3. Since Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000, the total cost of the chickens is the total revenue minus the desired profit:
\[
9000 - 2000 = 7000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Isaias bought the chickens for is:
\[
\boxed{7000}

"To find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we start with the total number of glasses sold, which is 32. Julie sold 14 glasses. This leaves us with the number of glasses sold by Micah and Mitchell combined, which is \(32 - 14 = 18\). Since Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, we divide 18 by 2 to find out how many glasses each sold: \(18 \div 2 = 9\). 

Now, to find out how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, we subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold: \(14 - 9 = 5\).

Therefore, Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how much Iris spent at the spa, we need to calculate the cost of each service and then sum them up.

1. **Hair Service:**
   Iris spent $400 on her hair.

2. **Manicure:**
   The cost of the manicure is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the cost of the hair service.
   \[
   \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Pedicure:**
   The cost of the pedicure is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the cost of the manicure.
   \[
   \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum the costs of all the services:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is:
\[

"Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long and sells it for $2 per meter, making a total revenue of $40. She uses this $40 to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide $40 by $1.5 per meter:

\[
\frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{40 \times 2}{1.5 \times 2} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since she can only buy whole meters, she can buy 26 meters of the new rope. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[
26 \times 1.5 = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting the cost of the new rope from the total revenue gives:

\[
40 - 39 = 1 \text{ dollar}

Therefore, the amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope is \(\boxed{1}\) dollar."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining Melanie's current age. Given that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find the number of years, \( y \), from now when her age will be three times her current age. We set up the equation:

\[ 8 + y = 3 \times 8 \]
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

Solving for \( y \):

\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we first calculate the total cost of each type of item she has in her cart.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[

   \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:

Therefore, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is \(\boxed{5}\) dollars."
"To determine the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts, we start with the information that the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts and includes a 15-minute encore, summing up to a total of 65 minutes. Let's denote the usual runtime of her concerts as \( x \) minutes. 

Given that the final concert's runtime is \( 2x \) minutes, including the 15-minute encore, we can write the equation:
\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

To find \( x \), we first isolate \( 2x \) by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Therefore, the usual runtime of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we start by calculating the number of birds flying overhead. Given that there are 6 birds nesting in the bushes and 2/3 of that number are flying overhead, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
\]

Next, we calculate the number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding, so:

\[
\text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Adding the number of birds nesting, flying overhead, and feeding together gives us the total number of birds:

\[
\text{Total number of birds} = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34
\]

Therefore, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:

\[

"To determine how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we start by calculating the total number of petals for each type of flower.

First, we calculate the total number of petals on the orchids:
- Joelle has 5 orchids.
- Each orchid has 5 petals.
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies:
- Joelle has 4 African daisies.
- Each daisy has 10 petals.
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we find the difference in the number of petals between the daisies and the orchids:
\[ 40 \text{ petals (daisies)} - 25 \text{ petals (orchids)} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

"To determine the speed of a whirligig, we start by identifying the relationship between the speeds of the whirligig, thingamabob, and whatchamacallit. Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can find the speed of the thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins five times faster than a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of the whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

Thus, the speed of the whirligig is \(55\) meters per second."
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we start with the total daily expenditure and subtract the known costs of the salad and yogurt. Ellen's daily expenditure is $11, the salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $3. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

Thus, the cost of one carrot every day is $1. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings after the pay raise, we start by calculating his new hourly wage. Initially, his hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:
\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find his weekly earnings, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Thus, Mark makes $480 a week. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 480 \]"
"Given the information, Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. The payment for mowing Joe's lawn is $6, and she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times. Therefore, the total payment from mowing lawns is \( 6x \).

Since her total earnings are $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Lemonade Sales} = 80 - 6x \]

To find the exact amount from lemonade sales, we need to determine the value of \( x \). However, the problem does not provide the value of \( x \). Assuming \( x = 1 \) for simplicity (as a common assumption if not specified), the amount made from lemonade sales would be:
\[ 80 - 6 \times 1 = 80 - 6 = 74 \]

Thus, the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{74} \]"
"To find the weight of Harry, we start with Martin's weight of 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, so:

Next, Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's:

\[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]

Finally, Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's:

\[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from renting the car:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750/\text{month} \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the monthly car payment from the total earnings:

\[ \$750/\text{month} - \$500/\text{month} = \$250/\text{month} \]

Thus, John's profit on his car is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of notebooks Martha originally had as \( M \).

Given that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can express the number of notebooks Joseph had as \( 3M \).

Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ M + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Consequently, Joseph had:
\[ 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ notebooks} \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we calculate:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final numerical answer is:

"Dean starts with 30 marbles. He gives away \(\frac{1}{5}\) of them to Jamie, which is:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \text{ marbles}
\]

Additionally, he gives 10 marbles to Donald. Therefore, the total number of marbles given away is:

\[
6 + 10 = 16 \text{ marbles}
\]

Subtracting the total given away from the original number of marbles, the number of marbles left for Dean is:

\[
30 - 16 = 14 \text{ marbles}
\]

Thus, the final number of marbles left for Dean is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Given the problem, we start with the equation derived from the information provided:

\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:

\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]
\[ A = 30 \]

Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 38 \]"
"To find the total number of acres for both Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms, we start by calculating the size of Farmer Smith's farm. Given that Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, twice this size is:

\[ 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres} \]

Adding 100 acres to this amount gives the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

\[ 400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres} \]

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms combined, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

\[ 200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres} \]

Therefore, the total number of acres for both farms together is:

\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"To determine how much money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we start by calculating the number of packages he completes per hour. Given that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, we have:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of packages he completes in an eight-hour workday:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Since Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes, his total earnings for the workday are:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is:

\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"To determine how many bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme Sudoku puzzle, we start by calculating the duration of the extreme Sudoku puzzle. Given that a normal Sudoku puzzle takes 45 minutes and an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times that long, we calculate:

\[ 45 \text{ minutes} \times 4 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes. Since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour, we divide 180 minutes by 30 minutes:

\[ \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/half-hour}} = 6 \text{ half-hours} \]

Since John drinks one bottle of water every half-hour, the number of bottles of water he drinks in 180 minutes is:

\[ 6 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given information:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
- The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.
- The number of red balloons is 20.

We can set up the equation based on the total pieces of bologna:
\[ 2R + 3Y = 58 \]

Given that \( R = 20 \), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[ 2(20) + 3Y = 58 \]
\[ 40 + 3Y = 58 \]

Next, we isolate \( 3Y \) by subtracting 40 from both sides:
\[ 3Y = 58 - 40 \]
\[ 3Y = 18 \]

Then, we solve for \( Y \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[ Y = \frac{18}{3} \]
\[ Y = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow balloons is \( 6 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To determine how many tune-ups Jon needs, we start by calculating the total distance he drives in a month. Jon drives 100 miles each day for 30 days, so the total distance is:

\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

Given that his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide the total distance by 1000 to find the number of tune-ups:

\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 3 \]"
"To determine the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days, we can calculate as follows:

- On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
- On Wednesday, he works twice the time he worked on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
- On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than he did on Wednesday, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Adding these together, the total number of hours Bruce works is \(5 + 10 + 8 = 23\) hours.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 23."
"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we first need to calculate the total amount of money they spent on the items they bought. Let's break down the costs:

1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[ \text{Amount each received} = \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Kira bought a total of 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges, which sums up to 14 pieces of fruit. After Lola ate 2 pieces, the number of pieces left is 14 - 2 = 12 pieces.

"To find the total number of students participating in various sports, we start by calculating the number of students playing each sport:

1. **Tennis**: There are 6 students playing tennis.
2. **Volleyball**: Since there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis, the number of volleyball players is:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ students}
   \]

Next, we sum the number of students playing tennis and volleyball:
\[
6 \text{ (tennis)} + 12 \text{ (volleyball)} = 18 \text{ students}
\]

Now, we consider the students playing soccer:
- There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so the total number of students playing soccer is:
\[
16 + 22 = 38 \text{ students}
\]

Since each student only participates in one group, we add the number of students playing tennis, volleyball, and soccer to find the total number of students:
\[
18 \text{ (tennis and volleyball)} + 38 \text{ (soccer)} = 56 \text{ students}
\]

Thus, the total number of students is:
\[
\boxed{56}

"To calculate the profit from selling lollipops, we start by determining the total number of lollipops sold. Given that each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops, the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Then, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

Finally, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."

"To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we start by calculating the total number of slices Abby and Josh can eat together in one day. Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, which is 4 slices a day. Therefore, together they eat:

\[ 2 \text{ slices (Abby)} + 4 \text{ slices (Josh)} = 6 \text{ slices per day} \]

Given that the loaf of bread has 24 slices, the number of days the loaf will last is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices per day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

Thus, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days."
"Martha collects shells every month, starting from her 5th birthday and continuing until her 10th birthday. To find out how many months she has been collecting shells, we calculate the difference in years and convert it to months:

- From age 5 to 10 is 5 years.
- Since there are 12 months in a year, 5 years is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) months.

Since she collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is:

\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of cups of mint tea in each row. Let's break it down step by step.

Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea. She uses 15 cups to brew cinnamon tea, leaving her with:
\[ 27 - 15 = 12 \]
These 12 cups are equally divided between chamomile and mint tea, so she brews:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
cups of each (chamomile and mint).

Since she divides these 27 cups into 3 rows, each row contains:
\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]
cups of tea. Given that the cups in each row are equally divided between chamomile and mint tea, each row contains:
\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]
cups of mint tea.

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we start by analyzing the time and resources involved in each trip.

Given:
- The sloth takes 4 hours to complete one trip down to the ground and back up to the tree.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

First, we calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:
\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many berries the sloth can pick up per trip to meet the requirement of collecting 24 berries in 8 hours. Since the sloth makes 2 trips in 8 hours, the number of berries picked up per trip is:
\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Thus, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we start by calculating the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool contains 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water is removed from the tank over 6 days, given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. The total amount of water removed in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we start by calculating the total amount spent on popcorn and candy. Colby spent $8 per tub of popcorn and had 2 tubs, and $2 per box of candy and had 4 boxes. Therefore, the total spent on popcorn and candy is:

\[ 2 \times 8 + 4 \times 2 = 16 + 8 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we subtract the amount spent on popcorn and candy from his total monthly budget of $150:

\[ 150 - 24 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Since it is the last day of the month and it is a Friday, Colby can only see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday. Each movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday costs $10. Therefore, with $126 remaining, the number of additional movies he can see is:

\[ \left\lfloor \frac{126}{10} \right\rfloor = 12 \text{ movies} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find the total calories from the mini pastries, we start by calculating the calories in a mini version of each pastry.

For the mini cinnamon rolls:
- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories.
- A mini cinnamon roll has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal cinnamon roll.
- Therefore, a mini cinnamon roll has \( \frac{600}{3} = 200 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 200 mini cinnamon rolls.
- The total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls are \( 200 \times 200 = 40000 \) calories.

For the mini blueberry muffins:
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories.
- A mini blueberry muffin has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the calories of a normal blueberry muffin.
- Therefore, a mini blueberry muffin has \( \frac{450}{3} = 150 \) calories.
- Andrew bakes 300 mini blueberry muffins.
- The total calories from the mini blueberry muffins are \( 300 \times 150 = 45000 \) calories.

Adding the total calories from both types of pastries:
- Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls: 40000 calories.
- Total calories from mini blueberry muffins: 45000 calories.
- The combined total calories are \( 40000 + 45000 = 85000 \) calories.

\[ 31 \text{ (building blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48 \text{ toys} \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls were in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:

\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 14 \]"
"Given the equations derived from the problem statement:

1. \( P + Pa + J = 100 \)
2. \( Pa = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = Pa + J \)

We substitute \( Pa \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[ P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \]

Next, we substitute \( P \) and \( Pa \) into the first equation:
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
\[ 4J = 80 \]
\[ J = 20 \]

Now, we find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, the age of Peter is \( 50 \) years old."
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons. Including Maria's 1 water balloon, the total number of water balloons at the start is \(8 + 1 = 9\).

Her mom then gave each person 3 more water balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional water balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding the initial total to the additional balloons, the total number of water balloons is \(9 + 15 = 24\).

Therefore, the total number of water balloons the girls had is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"To determine the number of new tables needed, we start by calculating the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale. 

1. Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes of stuff:

   10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already:
   \[
   10 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. Adding these together gives the total number of boxes:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes}

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be the cost of the 24-hour option minus the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option.
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we start by calculating the hay requirement for each type of livestock.

Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay. With 15 goats, the total hay needed for the goats is:
\[
15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, each sheep needs:
\[
2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

With 12 sheep, the total hay needed for the sheep is:
\[
12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}

"John's total earnings for the week are calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has:

\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

After depositing 100 dollars in the bank, he has:

\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

The cost of 5 pencils, each costing 10 dollars, is:

\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money gives:

\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

With 100 dollars left, the number of 25 dollar pens he can buy is:

29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles}
\]

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she has:

\[
900 \text{ bottles} - 58 \text{ bottles} = 842 \text{ bottles}
\]

Thus, the number of bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself is:

\[
\boxed{842}

"To determine the total charge for the job, we need to sum up the fixed visit fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. The fixed visit fee is $40.
2. The labor cost is $35 per hour for 2.25 hours, which is calculated as \(35 \times 2.25 = 78.75\).
3. The cost of parts is $60.

Adding these together:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

Therefore, Patty charged:
\[ \boxed{178.75} \]"
"To determine how much money James was out, we start by calculating the total cost of the 10 CDs before the discount. Each CD costs $15, so the total cost is:

\[ 10 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$150 \]

Next, we apply the 40% discount to the total cost:

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$150 = 0.40 \times \$150 = \$60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:

\[ \$150 - \$60 = \$90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The cost of these 5 CDs is:

\[ 5 \text{ CDs} \times \$15 \text{ per CD} = \$75 \]

The amount of money James makes from selling these 5 CDs is $40. Therefore, the net loss from selling these CDs is:

\[ \$75 - \$40 = \$35 \]

Thus, the total amount of money James was out is:

\[ \$35 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{35}
\]"
"To calculate Jen's total earnings from selling her root crops, we proceed as follows:

1. **Yams Earnings**: Jen has 6 yams, each sold at $1.5. Therefore, the total earnings from yams are:
   \[
   6 \times 1.5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Sweet Potatoes Earnings**: Jen has 10 sweet potatoes, each sold at $2. Therefore, the total earnings from sweet potatoes are:
   \[
   10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Carrots Earnings**: Jen has 4 carrots, each sold at $1.25. Therefore, the total earnings from carrots are:
   \[
   4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total earnings:
\[
9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Jen will earn **$34** if she sells everything."
"To determine the total time James took to swim across the lake, we will break down the problem step by step using algebraic methods.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half the initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]"
"To find out how many loaves of bread the bakery has, we start with the information that the bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had last Friday. Given that Sam had 70 loaves, we can calculate the number of loaves the bakery has as follows:

\[ \text{Bakery loaves} = 7 \times 70 - 40 \]

First, we calculate \( 7 \times 70 \):

\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, we subtract 40 from 490:

\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

Therefore, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 450 \]"
"Jasmine starts with 15 stickers. She loses 7, leaving her with:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we'll break down the calculation into two parts: the commission from the New York Times and the commission from the Wall Street Journal.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each New York Times.
- Commission per New York Times = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.
- Total commission from New York Times = 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each Wall Street Journal.
- Commission per Wall Street Journal = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal = 10 * $1.20 = $12.

Finally, we sum up the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal = $3 + $12 = $15.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To determine Leo's age, we start with the information provided:

1. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old. Therefore, Marcus's age is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years.
2. Marcus is half of Leo's age. If Marcus is 21 years old, then Leo's age is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
42"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the points scored by Azibo as \( A \). According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so Bahati's points are \( A + 20 \). Additionally, Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so Dinar's points are \( A + 20 - 10 = A + 10 \).

The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ A + 20 + A + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Next, we solve for \( A \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
\[ 3A + 30 - 30 = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

Thus, Azibo scored 5 points. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total number of pages in the book, we start by understanding the given information:

- The book is 1.5 inches thick.
- Each inch of paper contains 100 pages when stacked.
- Each page is printed on both sides of the paper.

First, we calculate the number of pages in 1 inch of paper:
\[
1 \text{ inch} = 100 \text{ pages}
\]

Next, we extend this to 1.5 inches:
\[
1.5 \text{ inches} = 1.5 \times 100 \text{ pages} = 150 \text{ pages}
\]

Since each page is printed on both sides, the total number of pages in the book is:
\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, he worked for 16 hours. Converting this time into minutes gives us 960 minutes. Since he staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can determine the total number of reports he stapled by calculating how many 15-minute intervals fit into 960 minutes. This is done by dividing 960 by 15, which equals 64 intervals. Multiplying the number of intervals (64) by the number of reports stapled per interval (30) gives us the total number of reports stapled, which is 1920. Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1920."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to account for her total sleep time, the time she spent sleepwalking, and the time she woke up early.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Calculate the time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Calculate the time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual at 5:55 a.m.
   - The usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Calculate the total time she was awake:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is \( 7 \text{ hours and } 55 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Converting this to minutes: \( 7 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 420 \text{ minutes} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 475 \text{ minutes} \).

5. **Calculate the total time spent sleepwalking and waking up early:**
   - Total time awake: 475 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Time waking up early: 5 minutes
   - Total time not sleeping: \( 23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes} \).

6. **Calculate the actual sleep time:**
   - Total sleep time: 480 minutes
   - Time not sleeping: 28 minutes
   - Actual sleep time: \( 480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{452}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of measuring cups Jonathan has. Given that he has two dozen measuring cups, and knowing that one dozen equals 12, we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons Jonathan has. According to the problem, he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. Therefore, the number of measuring spoons is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \]

Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, so the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Now, we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining. This is the sum of the measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we start by calculating the initial number of occupied beds. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of these beds are occupied, we can calculate the initial number of occupied beds as follows:

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

This means the initial number of unoccupied beds is:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Next, we need to account for the patients admitted over 2 weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day and there are 14 days in 2 weeks, the total number of patients admitted is:

\[
\text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

Adding these admitted patients to the initial number of occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900
\]

Finally, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100
\]

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"To determine how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we start with the total number of emails she sends each day, which is 16. Out of these, 7 are work emails, leaving us with:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 9 emails are sent to her family. According to the problem, two-thirds of the remaining emails are to her family. Therefore, the number of emails sent to her family is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

After sending emails to her family, the number of emails left is:

\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of these remaining emails are sent to her boyfriend. Thus, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend each day is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we start by finding Shawna's age. Given that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate Shawna's father's age, knowing that he is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old. The final answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, given that Courtney's reported number of 48 is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]

Performing the division:

\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Given the problem, we have the relationships between the number of balls carried by Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey. Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 4J \) balls.

We are informed that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we can follow these steps:

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: The pirates dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: The pirates dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, resulting in a net increase of \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

By the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

4. **Fourth Day**: The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the total number of holes by the end of the third day should be:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Therefore, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and understanding the relationships given in the question. Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins received as \( C \).

Given that Amora and Lainey each received 70 corn chips, and Collins received 15 more than either of them, we can express the number of corn chips Collins received as:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We sum the number of corn chips each person received:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Calculating the sum:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To determine the cost of the travel tickets, we start with the cost of the supplies, which is $400. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. 

First, we calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, we add this amount to the cost of the supplies to find the total cost of the travel tickets:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon caught by Stan.
- Let \( X \) be the number of Pokemon caught by Alex.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

First, substitute \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the third equation:

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Now, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now, find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[
S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, find \( X \):

\[
X = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Verify the total:

\[
X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is \( \boxed{147} \)."
"Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can deduce the number of episodes. Since \( M = 20 \) minutes per episode, the number of episodes \( E \) is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) episodes.

To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode:
\[ \text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes."
"To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled in each segment of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ \boxed{446} \]"
"To determine the total number of brownies Greta had left over, we'll start by calculating the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies eaten.

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office, she received half a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Summing these up gives the total number of brownies received:
\[
12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
\]

Next, we account for the brownies eaten during the party. The party-goers ate 1 1/2 dozen brownies:
\[
1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
\]

Subtracting the eaten brownies from the total gives the number of brownies left:
\[
66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten brownies)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
\]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"To find the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister, we start by calculating each individual's age. Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so:

\[ \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age:

\[ \text{Sister's age} = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years} \]

Adding these ages together gives the total age of the three family members:

\[ \text{Total age} = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the total age of all three family members is 30 years."

   - Total time for synthetic gut: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) minutes

2. **Polyester String Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time for polyester string: \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time for hybrid sets: \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \) minutes

Now, we sum the times for all the racquets:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is:
\[ \boxed{227} \]"

"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we start with the number of players on Carlton's team, which is 13. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, so we add 7 to 13 to find the number of players on Zeke's team:

\[ \text{Number of players on Zeke's team} = 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Next, we add the number of players on both teams to get the total number of players:

\[ \text{Total number of players} = 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the total number of wooden slats Robert will need, we start by calculating the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substituting the given dimensions:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Given that Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Mrs. Harrington initially bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals 4 boxes. Therefore, she kept \(12 - 4 = 8\) boxes for herself.

Since she kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the oranges, the number of boxes she kept is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3\) boxes. Consequently, the number of boxes she sold is \(12 - 3 = 9\) boxes.

Given that each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is \(9 \times 20 = 180\) oranges.

Thus, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of states in the USA as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of states in India is \( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \).

The total number of states in both countries is the sum of the states in the USA and India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \left( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{2S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3S}{2} + 4 \]

Without a specific value for \( S \), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume the USA has 50 states, then:
\[ S = 50 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{150}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 75 + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together, assuming the USA has 50 states, is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we first calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to earn is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Thus, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books. The final numerical answer is:

5"
"To solve the problem algebraically, let's define the number of cherries Richard has as \( R \). Given that Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can express Robert's cherries as \( R + 10 \). We also know that Robert has 30 cherries, so we can set up the equation:

\[ R + 10 = 30 \]

Solving for \( R \):

\[ R = 30 - 10 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

So, Richard has 20 cherries. The total number of cherries is 60, and since Robert has 30 cherries, the number of cherries Jerry has can be found by subtracting the cherries of Richard and Robert from the total:

\[ \text{Cherries Jerry has} = 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \]

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ \text{Difference} = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine Sunny's total earnings over the two days, we will calculate the number of boxes sold and then the total revenue from each type of baked good.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

**Total boxes sold:**
- Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Apple pie: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

**Earnings calculation:**
- Price per box of gingerbread: $6
- Total earnings from gingerbread: 25 * $6 = $150

- Price per box of apple pie: $15
- Total earnings from apple pie: 21 * $15 = $315

**Total earnings:**
- Total earnings: $150 (gingerbread) + $315 (apple pie) = $465

Therefore, the total amount Sunny earned for the two days is **$465**."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside over 8 days.
2. Determine the total amount of sunscreen she will need.
3. Calculate how many 8-ounce bottles are required to cover the total amount of sunscreen needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside.**

Pamela spends 4 hours outside each day for 8 days:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of sunscreen she will need.**

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour. Therefore, for 32 hours:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many 8-ounce bottles are required.**

Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen. To find out how many bottles are needed for 32 ounces:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final numerical answer is:

"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, which means the red car costs 60% of the price of the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we can calculate the cost of the red car as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of the red car} = 60\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.60 \times 100 = \$60 \]

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the cost of the red car to the cost of the blue car:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$100 + \$60 = \$160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is \$160."
"Given the problem, we start by noting Emil's current age \( E = 19 \). We need to find the current ages of his dad and his brother, \( D \) and \( B \) respectively, under the conditions provided.

First, we determine the number of years until Emil turns 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

When Emil is 24, his dad's age will be \( D + 5 \) and his brother's age will be \( B + 5 \). According to the problem, at that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]

Additionally, at that time, Emil will be twice the age of his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ B = 7 \]

Now, we find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we start by calculating the beads given by each person:

- Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
- Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
- Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total number of beads:

\[
20 \text{ (mother)} + 30 \text{ (sister)} + 40 \text{ (friend)} = 90
\]

Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To find out how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we first calculate the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days. On Thursday, he caught 3 pounds. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of crawfish:
\[3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving to find the number of servings:
\[\frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}\]

Therefore, the number of servings Joe has is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To find out how many students are leaving early, we start by calculating the number of football players. Given that 20% of the 30 students are football players:

\[ 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, there are 6 football players. This leaves us with:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

students who are not football players. Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

Adding the football players to the cheerleaders or band members, we get:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the total number of students leaving early is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we start by noting that Sophie's boots are size 5. Since Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, Charlie's boots are size 25.

The total size of the boots worn by both Charlie and Sophie is:
\[ 5 + 25 = 30 \]

The average size of the shoes is then calculated by dividing the total size by 2:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers required to fill her flower bed.

Each flower occupies 1 foot of space, and there is a 1.5-foot space between each pair of flowers. Let \( n \) be the total number of flowers needed. The equation representing the total space occupied by the flowers and the spaces between them is:
\[ n \text{ flowers} \times 1 \text{ foot/flower} + (n-1) \text{ spaces} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/space} = 111 \text{ feet} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ n + 1.5(n-1) = 111 \]
\[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n = 112.5 \]
\[ n = \frac{112.5}{2.5} \]
\[ n = 45 \]

So, Pat needs 45 flowers in total. Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, she needs to buy:
\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ flowers} \]

Each flower costs $6, so the total cost for the flowers is:
\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store is:
\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we start by calculating the daily consumption of Edgar's brother. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we have:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's daily consumption} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

Next, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's weekly consumption} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

Therefore, the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week is:

\[ 63 \]"
"To find out how much Katherine will spend on filling all 5 hanging baskets, we first calculate the cost for one basket and then multiply by 5.

For one basket:
- The cost of 3 petunias at $3.00 each is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.
- The cost of 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each is \(2 \times 2.5 = 5\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for one basket is \(9 + 5 = 14\) dollars.

For 5 baskets, the total cost is \(5 \times 14 = 70\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount Katherine will spend is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we first calculate the total soil used for the sunflowers and carnations.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we first calculate her monthly savings for shoes:

\[
\text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500
\]

Next, we determine her total savings for the year:

\[
\text{Yearly savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000
\]

Given that each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we can now find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year:

\[
\text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6
\]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To determine the total time Emily needs to peel and saute 90 shrimp, we'll break down the tasks separately and then sum the times.

First, we calculate the time required to peel 90 shrimp. Given that Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time required to saute 90 shrimp. The problem states that Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To saute 90 shrimp, we need to find out how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:

\[
\text{Number of sets of 30 shrimp in 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set takes 10 minutes, the total time to saute 90 shrimp is:

\[
\text{Time to saute 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ sets} \times 10 \text{ minutes/set} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we add the time to peel and the time to saute to find the total time:

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and saute 90 shrimp is **45 minutes**."
"To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to calculate the net effect of the cooling and warming processes.

1. **Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling on low: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling on high: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: 6 degrees.
- Cooling on high: 12 degrees.
- Warming up: 4 degrees.

Net change in temperature:
\[ 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the room warms up by 14 degrees, it is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature. Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the key information provided:

1. Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
2. Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
3. Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

First, we calculate the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the second time:
\[ \text{Bill's age for the second sighting} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old} \]

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, the time between the first and second sightings is 75 years. Therefore, the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time is:
\[ 90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we'll sum up the checks for each category:

1. **Electric Bill Check**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month.
   - Number of electric bill checks per year: \(12 \text{ checks}\)

2. **Gas Bill Check**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month.
   - Number of gas bill checks per year: \(12 \text{ checks}\)

3. **Church Check**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month.
   - Number of church checks per year: \(2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}\)

4. **Pest and Lawn Service Check**: Buford writes a check quarterly (every 3 months).
   - Number of pest and lawn service checks per year: \(4 \text{ checks}\)

Now, we sum up all the checks:

\[
12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \text{ checks}
\]

Therefore, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is \(\boxed{52}\)."
"To determine the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day, we start by defining the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are equally split between flights to France and flights to Germany. This means:

- The number of flights to Greece is \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
- The number of flights to France is \( \frac{1}{4}F \).
- The number of flights to Germany is \( \frac{1}{4}F \).

We are also informed that the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day is:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Given this, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \)."
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl:

- Tobias howls for 20 seconds per howl.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds per howl.
- Igneous howls for as long as the combined duration of Tobias and Chikote, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds per howl.

Next, we sum the durations of all three wolves:
- Combined duration: \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

Finally, we convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes:
- \(120\) seconds is equivalent to \(120 \div 60 = 2\) minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"To determine how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we start by calculating the total amount of money he received from his parents. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice that amount, which is $12. Adding these amounts together, we get:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find Wilfred's age, we start with the total age of the children, which is 20 years. We know the ages of Akbar and Alessandro: Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old. Let's denote the ages of Helene and Wilfred as \( H \) and \( W \) respectively.

First, we set up the equation for the total age:
\[
A + A_s + H + W = 20
\]
Substituting the known ages:
\[
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
\]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[
7 + H + W = 20
\]
Subtracting 7 from both sides:
\[
H + W = 13
\]

Next, we use the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is:
\[
\text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]
Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[
H = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Now, substituting \( H = 10 \) into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[
10 + W = 13
\]
Solving for \( W \):
\[
W = 13 - 10 = 3
\]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we first calculate the total amount Walter has collected so far:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we add the $200 given by Walter's friend to the total collected so far:

- Total collected so far: $2000
- Amount given by Walter's friend: $200

Total amount donated by everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

- Amount donated by everyone else: $2200
- Lawyer's contribution: 3 * $2200 = $6600

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we start by calculating the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we start by understanding the distribution of slices. Given that each adult's slice is twice as big as each child's slice, we can denote the volume of each child's slice as \( x \). Consequently, the volume of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).

Since there are 4 children and 2 adults, the total volume of the watermelon can be expressed as:
\[ 4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total volume \( V \) of the watermelon is \( 8x \).

Next, we calculate the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \). The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is:
\[ \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

Therefore, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we first calculate the total time spent on inpatients and appointments.

He spends 20 minutes per inpatient and has 9 inpatients:
\[ 9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]
Converting 180 minutes to hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he spends 30 minutes per appointment and has 10 appointments:
\[ 10 \text{ appointments} \times 30 \text{ minutes per appointment} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]
Converting 300 minutes to hours:
\[ 300 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Adding the time spent on inpatients and appointments:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Given that Doctor Jones spends a total of 9 hours at the clinic, the time left for updating his records is:
\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we first calculate the total time required for all the steps:

- Making the cake batter: 20 minutes
- Baking the cake: 30 minutes
- Cooling the cake: 2 hours = 120 minutes
- Frosting the cake: 10 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 180 minutes into hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete all the steps. She wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest start time, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is:
\[ 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we start by determining the total cost per session. The fixed cost to rent the studio is $25, and the variable cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars. Therefore, the total cost per session is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the total number of sessions in a month. The studio is rented 3 days a week, and assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions per month is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) sessions.

Finally, the total earnings per month are the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is \(40 \times 12 = 480\) dollars.

Thus, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are \(\boxed{480}\) dollars."
"To determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we start by solving for the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes and each of Martha's boxes.

Given:
- Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.
- Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.

First, we find the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
\[
4p = 64 \implies p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Next, we find the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes:
\[
7m = 56 \implies m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we calculate the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Therefore, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To determine the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we start with the initial population of 50 porcupines. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Adding the babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines after a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]"
"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Pool:**
   The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given the dimensions:
   - Length = 25 feet
   - Width = 14 feet
   - Depth = 4 feet

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet}
   \]

2. **Convert Volume to Gallons:**
   The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed:
   \[
   \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Cost:**
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is \(\boxed{826}\)."
"To determine the total number of sticks, we start by identifying the number of each color of stick:

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. **Yellow Sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Next, we sum the number of sticks of each color to find the total number of sticks:
\[ 9 \text{ (red)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (yellow)} = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we first calculate the distance each person traveled.

For Matteo:

   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
   \]

7. **Female students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total female students:**
   \[
   \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Therefore, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we start by calculating the laps each person can run:

- Bethany can run 10 laps.
- Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey runs \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
- Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn runs \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
- Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn runs \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run: \(10 - 5 = 5\).

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final answer is 5."
"To determine the remaining capacity of the tank, we'll calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days.

### Day 1:
- Wanda fills \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity:
  \[
  \text{Wanda's contribution} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumps \( \frac{3}{4} \) of what Wanda pumped:
  \[
  \text{Ms. B's contribution} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Total water pumped on Day 1:
  \[
  \text{Total on Day 1} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### Day 2:
- Wanda pumps \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on Day 1:
  \[
  \text{Wanda's contribution on Day 2} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumps \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on Day 1:
  \[
  \text{Ms. B's contribution on Day 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Total water pumped on Day 2:
  \[
  \text{Total on Day 2} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}

"To find the initial charge of the power bank, we start with the equation derived from the given conditions. The power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour for the first 5 hours, and then 7% of its remaining charge each hour for the next 3 hours, ending with 28% of its initial charge.

First, we calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the charge loses 7% each hour:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \]

Given that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%, we set up the equation:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

We know:
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.656 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]

Thus:
\[ 0.656 \times 0.817 \approx 0.534 \]

So:
\[ 0.534 \times C = 0.28 \]
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.534} \approx 0.524 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 52.4\% \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52.4\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car, we first calculate the amount she needs to save. 

20% of $10,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate Janet's weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we start by calculating the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these costs together gives the total spent so far:
Total spent = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend initially. After purchasing the fruits, the remaining money is:
Remaining money = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. The number of plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75 is:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is 3. The correct answer is 3."
"To determine how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we start by calculating the total number of pieces of sweets in the box. Since there are 15 packs and each pack contains 60 pieces, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs given to her friends is:

\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

These 13 packs are to be divided equally among her 10 friends. Therefore, each friend receives:

\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[ 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

Thus, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we use the formula for compound growth:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 + r)^t \]

Given:
- Initial price \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- Annual growth rate \( r = 0.05 \)
- Time \( t = 3 \) years

Substituting the values:

\[ P(3) = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculating \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P(3) = 120 \times 1.157625 \]
\[ P(3) \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P(3) \approx 139 \]

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately **$139**."
"To determine the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, we start with the total number of pictures and the distribution into albums.

Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures into 8 albums. We know that 3 albums are for selfies only and 2 albums are for portraits only. This leaves us with 3 albums that are for other categories.

Given that the 3 albums for other categories are evenly split between selfies and portraits, we can assume each of these 3 albums contains an equal number of pictures. Since the total number of pictures is 72 and there are 8 albums, each album contains:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Now, we distribute the pictures into the albums:
- **Selfies**: 3 albums
- **Portraits**: 2 albums
- **Other categories**: 3 albums

Since each album contains 9 pictures:
- **Selfies**: \( 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \)
- **Portraits**: \( 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \)

Adding the selfies and portraits together:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \text{ pictures} \]

However, this total (45) does not match the given total of 72 pictures. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the distribution. Given the problem's context, it's more likely that the 3 albums are split in a way that maintains whole numbers. Let's assume the simplest distribution where 2 albums are for selfies and 1 album is for portraits (or vice versa).

If 2 albums are for selfies and 1 album is for portraits:
- **Selfies**: \( 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ selfies} \)
- **Portraits**: \( 1 \text{ album} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 9 \text{ portraits} \)

Adding the selfies and portraits together:
\[ 18 \text{ selfies} + 9 \text{ portraits} = 27 \text{ pictures} \]

Thus, the total number of selfies and portraits is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information. Let \( x \) represent the number of large stuffed animals sold. Consequently, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \).

Given that each small stuffed animal costs $4 and each large stuffed animal costs three times that amount, we have:
\[ S = 4 \]
\[ L = 3S = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

The total earnings from the sales can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = (x \times L) + (2x \times S) \]
\[ 120 = (x \times 12) + (2x \times 4) \]
\[ 120 = 12x + 8x \]
\[ 120 = 20x \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

Since \( x \) represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 2x \), we have:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \).

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we leverage the fact that the prices are proportional. We start by calculating the price per sandwich for the packages with known quantities and prices.

For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
\[
\text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
\]

For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
\[
\text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
\]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistently $1.5. Therefore, for the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 100% or 1.00 (since he would have to turn it in if he doesn't get an extension)

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario: 60% (since 60% of the time he doesn't get an extension and thus has to turn it in)

The total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:

\[ 0.50 + 0.60 = 1.10 \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 1, we need to normalize this to a percentage:

\[ \frac{1.10}{2} = 0.55 \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ 0.55 \times 100 = 55\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine how many tickets each graduate will receive, we start by calculating the total number of seats that are already accounted for. This includes 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, which sums up to 1250 seats.

Next, we subtract the accounted seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are left for graduates and their guests:
\[ 6000 - 1250 = 4750 \]

Now, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive:
\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate will receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"
"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we'll follow a step-by-step approach using the given relationships:

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[
\boxed{450}
\]"
"To determine how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we start by calculating the total hours she spends on jury duty:

\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate her total earnings from the jury duty:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate her total parking expenses:

\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the expenses from her earnings gives her net earnings:

\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find her net earnings per hour, we divide her net earnings by the total hours spent:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

Thus, Melissa makes \(\boxed{2}\) dollars per hour after expenses."
"To determine the total amount Ted spent, we start by calculating the cost of the books and the pencils separately.

First, the cost of the books:
\[ 3 \text{ books} \times 16 \text{ dollars/book} = 48 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the cost of the pencils:
\[ 3 \text{ pencils} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pencil} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total expenditure:
\[ 48 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Ted spent is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles needed:**
   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet.
   - The number of bottles is calculated by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Determine the time to set off each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle, he will go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The time to go from one bottle to the next is 5 seconds.
   - Since there are 7 intervals, the total time is:
     \[
     7 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 35 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{35}\) seconds."
"To determine how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make, we start by calculating the total number of apples in two boxes. Given that each box contains 40 apples, the total number of apples in two boxes is:

\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of eight apples can be made from these 80 apples. This is done by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Therefore, the number of packs of apples Uncle Franky can make is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine how much money Amor will have left after her purchases, we start by calculating the total cost of the cheese she buys. 

First, we calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
\[
\text{Cost of Parmesan cheese} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 11 \text{ dollars/pound} = 22 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
\[
\text{Cost of mozzarella cheese} = 3 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of the cheese:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 22 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she will have left after her purchases, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
\[
\text{Money left} = 50 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"To determine how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the income he lost while in college, we need to calculate the total amount he borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had worked the entire time.

First, we calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his 4 years of college:
\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, we calculate his post-college income, which is triple his original income:
\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, we determine the total income he would have earned if he had worked for 8 years (4 years in college and 4 years after college):
\[ 75,000 \times 8 = 600,000 \]

The total amount he needs to earn to repay the loans and the income lost while in school is:
\[ 600,000 - 200,000 = 400,000 \]

To find out how long it would take him to earn $400,000 at his post-college income of $75,000 per year, we divide the total amount needed by his annual income:
\[ \frac{400,000}{75,000} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \]

Since Jim cannot work a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number, which means it would take him 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the income lost while in school.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs, we start by calculating the dimensions of each piece of fabric required. Given that the bed measures 6 feet in length and 8 feet in width, each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Thus, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

The area of one piece of fabric is calculated as:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric required is:
\[ \text{Total Area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we will calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   The number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters on Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17
   \]
   First, calculate one-fifth of 425:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
   \]
   Then add 17:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday:**
   The number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters on Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5
   \]
   First, calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then add 5:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

4. **Total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209
   \]
   Adding these numbers together:
   \[
   425 + 102 = 527
   \]
   \[
   527 + 209 = 736
   \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is \(\boxed{736}\)."

"To find out how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **First Race:** He lost $5.
2. **Second Race:** He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, he won \(2 \times 5 + 1 = 11\) dollars.
3. **Third Race:** He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost:
- First race: $5
- Second race: -$11 (since it's a win)
- Third race: -$16.5 (since it's a loss)

Total amount lost: \(5 - 11 - 16.5 = -22.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[
\text{Average amount lost per race} = \frac{-22.5}{3} = -7.5
\]

Therefore, the average amount lost per race is \(-7.5\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{-7.5}

"To find the total population in South America, we start by calculating the total number of cities. Given that there are 26 countries and each country has 5 cities, the total number of cities is:

\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Each city has a population of 1000 people. Therefore, the total population in South America is:

\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the total population in South America is:

\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their growth over the summer, we start by converting Xavier's initial height to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, Xavier's initial height of 4 feet is:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Xavier grew 3 inches, so his current height is:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and he grew 2 inches, so his current height is:

\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

The difference in height between Cole and Xavier is:

\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is \(\boxed{1}\) inch."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the amount taken by the first person as \( x \). According to the problem, the second person took \( x + 80 \) and the third person took \( 2(x + 80) \). The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = 420 \]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we start by calculating the total number of days the painters worked. Given that the painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day for 3 weeks, and knowing there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days worked is:

\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days} \]

Each painter worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by all 4 painters is:

\[ 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days} \]

Since this is the total for all 4 painters, the number of hours each painter worked is:

\[ \frac{7.875}{4} = 1.96875 \text{ days} \]

To convert this into hours, we multiply by 8 (since there are 8 hours in a day):

\[ 1.96875 \times 8 = 15.75 \text{ hours} \]

Thus, each painter put in 15.75 hours of work. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 15.75 \]"
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

Given:
- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We set up the equation:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To combine the terms involving \( x \), we convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[
2x = \frac{4x}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we start with the initial price of $20,000 in 2007 and apply the depreciation rate of 21% per year. The price of the car after each year can be calculated using the formula for exponential decay:

\[
\text{Price after } n \text{ years} = P \times (1 - r)^n
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the initial price ($20,000),
- \( r \) is the annual depreciation rate (0.21),
- \( n \) is the number of years from 2007 to 2010, which is 3 years.

Let's calculate the price step by step:

1. **2007 to 2008:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21) = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800
   \]

2. **2008 to 2009:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2009} = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12522
   \]

3. **2009 to 2010:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2010} = 12522 \times 0.79 = 9830.18
   \]

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is $9830.18.

\[
\boxed{9830.18}

"To find the number of Spanish books in the library, we start by calculating the number of English books. Since half of the 50 books are written in English:

\[
\text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]

Next, we calculate the number of German books, which is 10% of the total number of books:

\[
\text{Number of German books} = 10\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
\]

To find the number of Spanish books, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:

\[
\text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of Spanish books is 20.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To determine how many kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we start with the total distance from San Diego, California to New York City, New York, which is approximately 1955 kilometers. Bernice has already driven 325 kilometers.

The remaining distance can be calculated by subtracting the distance already driven from the total distance:

\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 1955 \text{ km} - 325 \text{ km} = 1630 \text{ km} \]

Therefore, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers."
"To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we start by calculating the total number of cups she drinks in that period. Given that Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day, over 30 days she drinks:

\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we convert the total number of cups into gallons. Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, the number of gallons Ingrid drinks in 30 days is:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days is \( 15 \) gallons."
"Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step to find the final number of people on the train.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train. Twice that number, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) people, board the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]
   So, there are 110 people on the train at the final stop.

The total number of people on the train at the final stop is:

"To find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we'll add up the costs of each item she purchased:

1. The tank top costs $10.
2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. The athletic socks originally cost $8, but with a $2 off coupon, they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, we sum these amounts:
\[ 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55 \]

Therefore, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear.

The final answer is \(\boxed{55}\)."
"To determine the cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we start by calculating the number of tiles needed. Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 ft, which means each tile covers an area of \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).

Given that the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, the number of tiles required is 200. Each tile costs $12. Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 200 \times 12 = 2400
\]

Thus, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400.

\[

"To determine how much James pays for insurance in a year, we start by calculating the increased monthly cost due to the accident. The normal monthly cost is $120, and the cost is 60% more due to the accident. Therefore, the increased monthly cost is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Increased monthly cost} = 120 + (120 \times 0.60) = 120 + 72 = 192 \]

Next, to find the annual cost, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ \text{Annual cost} = 192 \times 12 = 2304 \]

Thus, James pays $2304 a year for the insurance.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{2304} \]"
"To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we'll follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the number of loads for the twin beds:**
   - Greg has 4 twin beds.
   - Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the twin beds is:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ twin sets}}{2 \text{ twin sets per load}} = 2 \text{ loads}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of loads for the king size bed:**
   - Greg has 1 king size bed.
   - Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
   - Therefore, the number of loads needed for the king size bed is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ king set}}{1 \text{ king set per load}} = 1 \text{ load}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of loads per week:**
   - Total loads per week = Loads for twin beds + Loads for king size bed
   - Total loads per week = 2 loads + 1 load = 3 loads

4. **Calculate the total number of loads per year:**
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.
   - Total loads per year = Loads per week × Weeks per year
   - Total loads per year = 3 loads/week × 52 weeks/year = 156 loads

Therefore, the total number of loads of laundry Greg does in a year is:
\[

"To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, each fed 60 grams twice a day, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total daily consumption of cat food:
   - Each cat consumes \(60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams/day}\).
   - For 3 cats, the total daily consumption is \(120 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day}\).

2. Determine the number of days 720 grams of cat food will last:
   - Divide the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption: \(720 \text{ grams} \div 360 \text{ grams/day} = 2 \text{ days}\).

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the number of slices Jake ate. Given that Becky ate 10 slices and she ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Becky's slices} = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]
\[ 10 = \text{Jake's slices} + 3 \]
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 \]
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 7 \]

Next, we find out how many slices Silvia ate. The problem states that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake:

\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times \text{Jake's slices} \]
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 \]
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 14 \]

Now, we calculate the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia. Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas:

\[ \text{Total slices} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

To find the total slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia, we add the slices each of them ate:

\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} \]
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 10 + 7 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total slices eaten} = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of slices they ate is:

\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's denote the time Donovan's part took as \( D \) minutes. Consequently, Betsy's part took \( D + 18 \) minutes. The total time for the meal is the sum of the times for both parts, which is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Next, we isolate \( D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2D = 80 \]

Then, we solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, we calculate Betsy's part as follows:

\[ D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit, we need to sum up the individual costs:

1. **Cost of the cast**: $200
2. **Cost of the visit**: The doctor charges $300 per hour for a 30-minute visit, which is half an hour. Therefore, the cost is:
   \[
   \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Cost of the painkillers**: The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers. The total cost is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Cost of parking**: The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. The total cost is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up all these costs:
\[
200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of the doctor's visit is:
\[
\boxed{482}
\]"
"To determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, we start by calculating the number of emails that require a response each day. Given that 20% of the 80 emails do not require a response, it follows that 80% of the emails do require a response.

\[
\text{Number of emails requiring a response per day} = 80 \times 0.80 = 64
\]

Next, to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week, we multiply the number of emails requiring a response per day by 5:

\[
\text{Number of emails requiring a response in a 5-day work week} = 64 \times 5 = 320
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{320}
\]"
"To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we sum the number of classes for each day:

- Tuesday: Twice as many as Monday, which is \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes
- Wednesday: Three times as many as Monday, which is \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes
- Thursday: 30 classes
- Friday: 25 classes

Now, we add these numbers together:
\[
32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247
\]

Therefore, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is \(\boxed{247}\)."
"To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we first sum the scores of all the tests. The scores from the first 3 tests are 100, 100, and 100, and the score from the 4th test is 80. Adding these together gives:

\[ 100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380 \]

Next, we count the number of tests, which is 4. To find the average score, we divide the total sum of the scores by the number of tests:

\[ \text{Average score} = \frac{380}{4} = 95 \]

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"To determine the number of pizzas left, we start by calculating the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
\[ \text{Pizzas left by glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, we calculate the number of pizzas ordered by the football team, which is twice the number ordered by the glee club:

\[ \text{Pizzas ordered by football team} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:

\[ \text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
\[ \text{Pizzas left by football team} = 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Finally, we find the total number of pizzas left by adding the pizzas left by both the glee club and the football team:

\[ \text{Total pizzas left} = 6 + 8 = 14 \]

Thus, the number of pizzas left is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine the total cost of mailing the coupons, we start by calculating the number of big coupons Anthony wants to send. Given that he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he plans to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, and he is sending 700 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, and he is sending 1400 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"
"To find out how many meatballs were in the sub sandwiches that remained, we start by calculating the number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is:

\[ 10 - 3 = 7 \]

After Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, the number of remaining sandwiches is:

\[ 7 - 4 = 3 \]

Then, Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches, making the total number of sandwiches:

\[ 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Therefore, the final number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:

\[ 24 \]

The correct answer is 24."
"To solve the problem, we start with the total number of trucks dispatched, which is 20. A quarter of these trucks had mechanical failures, so the number of trucks with mechanical failures is:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:

\[
20 - 5 = 15
\]

Each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the 15 successful trucks is:

\[
15 \times 20 = 300
\]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter under the promotion, we need to consider the following:

1. Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
2. The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off,"" meaning for every 2 pounds purchased, Dennis pays for only 1 pound.

First, calculate the number of sets of 2 pounds Dennis needs to buy:
\[
\text{Number of sets} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
\]

For each set of 2 pounds, Dennis pays for 1 pound:
\[
\text{Cost per set} = 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$4.00
\]

Since Dennis needs 3 sets:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ sets} \times \$4.00 \text{ per set} = \$12.00
\]

Therefore, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To determine the total cost for Kayla's birthday party, we start by calculating the total number of guests invited:

- Kayla's classmates: 25
- Girls in her dance class: 7
- Family members: 13
- Total guests invited: \(25 + 7 + 13 = 45\)

Next, we account for the 4 people who could not attend:

- Guests who could not come: 4
- Guests who will attend: \(45 - 4 = 41\)

The base rental fee for the theater is $125 for up to 20 guests. For the additional guests beyond the initial 20, there is an additional fee of $6 per guest:

- Number of guests beyond the initial 20: \(41 - 20 = 21\)
- Additional fee for these guests: \(21 \times 6 = 126\)

Adding the base fee and the additional fee gives us the total cost:

- Total cost: \(125 + 126 = 251\)

Thus, the total cost for Kayla's birthday party is \(\boxed{251}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by determining how much money Maggie and Riza each have left after spending a portion of their initial amounts.

Maggie initially had $60 and spent a quarter of it:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
Thus, the amount left with Maggie is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Riza initially had $60 and spent one-third of it:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
Thus, the amount left with Riza is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

Adding the amounts left with Maggie and Riza gives:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[ \boxed{85} \]"
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we start by calculating the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a week. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week, it eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Adding the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week gives:
\[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas in total, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 250 pieces. Then, he completed another 500-piece puzzle, placing an additional 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final numerical answer is 750."
"To determine the total cost of the roses, we calculate the cost for 15 roses at $2 each:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny initially has five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

The difference between the total cost and the amount Jenny has is the change she needs:

\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since quarters are worth $0.25 each, the number of quarters she will receive as change is:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Therefore, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money Terry makes, we'll calculate the revenue from each item separately and then sum them up.

First, the revenue from the milkshakes:

"To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, let's break down the schedule step by step:

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves in 10 minutes, so it arrives in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.
   - The second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed in the station.
   - The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves in 60 minutes (30 + 30).
   - The third train arrives in 60 + 60 = 120 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves in 120 minutes.
   - The fourth train arrives in 120 + 20 = 140 minutes.

Paul needs to board the fourth train, which arrives at 140 minutes after the first train arrives. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, Paul will wait for the fourth train for 140 - 10 = 130 minutes.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect the remaining toothpicks, we start by calculating the number of toothpicks she still needs. Melanie has already saved 120 toothpicks, and she needs a total of 200 toothpicks. Therefore, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:

\[ 200 - 120 = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Thus, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we first calculate the total cost if she bought the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

The cost of each banana is $0.80. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches. Each bunch costs $3.00, and she buys 10 bunches. Therefore, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

The amount of money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually is:

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation based on the given conditions. Let \( S \) represent the amount of fence Sam gets. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, which gives us the equation:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by subtracting 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Then, we solve for \( S \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"

"To determine Marcel's earnings from selling bicycles, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of each type of bike sold:
- **Trekking bikes:** Half of the total bikes sold are Trekking bikes.
  \[
  \text{Number of Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
  \]
- **BMX bikes:** 15% of the total bikes sold are BMX bikes.
  \[
  \text{Number of BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
  \]
- **MTB bikes:** The rest of the bikes sold are MTB bikes.
  \[
  \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105
  \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from each type of bike:
- **Trekking bikes:** Each Trekking bike is sold for $450.
  \[
  \text{Total earnings from Trekking bikes} = 150 \times 450 = 67500
  \]
- **BMX bikes:** Each BMX bike is sold for half the price of an MTB bike, which is $250.
  \[
  \text{Total earnings from BMX bikes} = 45 \times 250 = 11250
  \]
- **MTB bikes:** Each MTB bike is sold for $500.
  \[
  \text{Total earnings from MTB bikes} = 105 \times 500 = 52500
  \]

Finally, we sum the total earnings from all types of bikes:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250
\]

Therefore, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"To determine how many bales of hay are left in the field after a 6-hour day, we need to calculate the net effect of the farmer making bales and the truck picking up bales.

1. **Calculate the number of bales made by the farmer in 6 hours:**

"To determine the height the ball reaches on its second bounce, we start with the initial height from which the ball is dropped. Given that each story is 24 feet high and the ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, the initial height is:

\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

On the first bounce, the ball reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its initial height:

\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

For the second bounce, the ball again reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce:

\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is:

\[ 32 \text{ feet} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To determine the earnings from selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of bags sold:**
   - Each bag contains 10 apples.
   - Total apples sold = 2000.
   - Number of bags = Total apples / Apples per bag = 2000 / 10 = 200 bags.

2. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Price per bag = $5.
   - Total earnings = Number of bags * Price per bag = 200 * 5 = $1000.

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples at $5 per bag.

The final numerical answer is:
1000"
"To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops, we start by understanding the sequence of events and the fractions of meat that were consumed or left behind.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, leaving \(\frac{x}{2}\) kilograms.
2. The velociraptors then scavenged half of what was left, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}\) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms of meat, which is \(\frac{x}{4}\) kilograms.

Given that the Allosaurus ate \(\frac{x}{4}\) kilograms, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]

To find \(x\), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 4:

\[
x = 270 \times 4
\]

\[
x = 1080
\]

Therefore, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1080}

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to analyze the sequence of events and calculate the probability step by step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 sodas.
   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - This leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken.

2. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.

3. **Ellen's Friend's Turn:**
   - Ellen's friend now has to choose 1 soda from the remaining 4 sodas (2 shaken and 2 unshaken).

We need to calculate the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The total number of sodas left is 4.
   - The number of shaken sodas left is 2.
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

5. **Expressing the Probability as a Percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100.

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. **Speed of the first train:**
   - The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.

2. **Speed of the second train:**
   - The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train.
   - Therefore, the speed of the second train is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

3. **Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - For the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:**
   - For the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Total distance = Distance traveled by the first train + Distance traveled by the second train
   - Total distance = \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is 270 miles."

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given information and translating it into mathematical terms. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of these large jellyfish change color under UV light. When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. We need to find the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as \( T \).

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
2. A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \) jellyfish change color.
3. According to the problem, when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

The final numerical answer is \( \boxed{90} \)."

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we start by calculating her annual savings. Given that she saves 20% of her annual salary of $100,000, her annual savings are:

\[
\text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
\]

Next, we need to find out how much she needs to save for her retirement. She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary in retirement, which amounts to:

\[
\text{Annual living expenses in retirement} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
\]

Since she plans to save for 20 years, the total amount she needs to save for retirement is:

\[
\text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
\]

To find out how many years she needs to work to save \$800,000, we divide the total retirement savings needed by her annual savings:

\[
\text{Number of years needed} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
\]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

"To determine the total number of students in the school, we start with the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. We can express this relationship with the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), the total number of students, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} = \frac{240 \times 100}{40} = \frac{24000}{40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, to find the number of girls, we note that 60% of the students are girls (since 100% - 40% = 60%). Therefore, the number of girls is:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Thus, the number of girls in the school is:

\[ \boxed{360} \]"

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the relationship between the distances walked by Sofie and Brian over a period of 7 days. Given that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, we can calculate her total distance over 7 days as follows:

\[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

The problem states that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Sofie's total distance} = 2 \times \text{Brian's total distance} \]

Substituting the known value for Sofie's total distance:

\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times \text{Brian's total distance} \]

To find Brian's total distance, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Brian's total distance} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in a 10-hour shift.

First, we calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, we calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, we find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 12 toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 8 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. Therefore, the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we start with Kory's dog which weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weights of Elijah's dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, adding Kory's dog to Elijah's total:
\[ \text{Total weight of both dogs} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"To determine the number of stickers Seth originally had, we can set up the problem algebraically.

Let \( S \) represent the number of stickers Seth initially had.

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. Therefore, Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total. Therefore, \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).

To find \( S \), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{S}{4} = 16
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4 gives:
\[
S = 16 \times 4 = 64
\]

Thus, Seth originally had 64 stickers. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}

"John packs M&M in small bags to eat. He buys 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each. If an ounce of M&M has 30 M&M in it, how many small bags can he make if he puts 10 M&M in each small bag?

First, calculate the total weight of the M&Ms:
\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, determine the total number of M&Ms:
\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Finally, calculate the number of small bags he can make if he puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag:
\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, the number of small bags John can make is:
\[ 90 \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we start by calculating half of the Earth's circumference. The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that distance is:

\[
\frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
\]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:

\[
\frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days}
\]

Therefore, the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth is 50 days."
"To find the speed of the fastest car, we start with the given information:

1. The average car can go 120 miles per hour.
2. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, the speed of the 2nd fastest car is:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

3. The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. Therefore, the speed of the fastest car is:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is 750 miles per hour."
"To solve the problem, let's use algebraic reasoning:

1. **Determine Liam's age two years ago:**
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.
   - Two years ago, Liam's age was \( 16 - 2 = 14 \) years old.

2. **Set up the relationship between Liam's and Vince's ages:**
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince.
   - Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago.

3. **Formulate the equation:**
   - Two years ago, Liam's age was 14, and this was twice Vince's age.
   - Therefore, \( 14 = 2V \).

4. **Solve for Vince's age two years ago:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]
   - So, Vince was 7 years old two years ago.

5. **Determine Vince's current age:**
   - Since two years have passed since then, Vince's current age is:
     \[
     7 + 2 = 9
     \]

Thus, Vince is currently 9 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables for the number of eggs painted by each person. Let \( A \) represent the number of eggs painted by Arnold and Madeline, and \( S \) represent the number of eggs painted by Sarah. Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, we have \( A = A \).

Given that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, we can express this as:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 9 \) into the equation \( A + S = 22 \):
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ A = 13 \]

Thus, Arnold and Madeline each painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Therefore, the number of eggs Camden painted more than Arnold is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8. This means he can make 25 groups. Each group of 8 crayons will go into one box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. The total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces (since each crayon weighs 1 ounce). Adding the weight of the boxes, which is 200 ounces, gives a total weight of 400 ounces. Converting this total weight into pounds (since there are 16 ounces in a pound), we get:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds. The correct answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"To determine how much John makes, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the length of logs John can make from the tree:**
   - The tree is 80 feet long.
   - He can make logs from 80% of the tree.
   - Therefore, the length of logs = \( 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \).

2. **Determine the number of 4-foot logs from the 64 feet of logs:**
   - Each log is 4 feet long.
   - Number of logs = \( \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \).

3. **Calculate the number of planks from the 16 logs:**
   - He cuts 5 planks from each log.
   - Number of planks = \( 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \).

4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the planks:**
   - Each plank is sold for $1.2.
   - Total revenue = \( 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \).

Therefore, John makes **$96**."
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we start by determining the brother's salary. Given that Valerie earns half of what her brother earns, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

Given Valerie's salary is $5000, we solve for the brother's salary:

\[ 5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times \text{Combined salary} \]

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} \]

\[ \text{Total amount} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we start by analyzing the time spent on each segment of her walk.

Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, which is 2 miles long. Given that her speed on the beach is \( v \) miles per minute, we can express her speed as:
\[ v = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

On the sidewalk, her speed is twice that on the beach, so her speed on the sidewalk is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Since the sidewalk segment is 1 mile long, the time spent on the sidewalk is:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the time spent on both segments gives the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Jane has saved $32 out of her $60 goal. To reach her goal, she needs to save an additional $28. Since she saves $4 each week, it will take her \( \frac{28}{4} = 7 \) more weeks to save the remaining amount. Therefore, the number of additional weeks required is 7."

\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To determine the initial number of marbles Bob has, we start with the equation derived from the problem statement:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from both sides:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

Given that Bob initially has 36 marbles, if he loses 10 of them, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"To determine the minimum temperature \( T \) of the second mug of water such that the average temperature of the water in Donny's water bottle is at least 40 degrees, we start with the equation for the average temperature:

\[
\frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
\frac{28 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5 to clear the denominator:

\[
28 + T \geq 200
\]

Subtracting 28 from both sides:

\[
T \geq 172

"To find the total number of animals on Melanie's farm after three weeks, we start with the initial count of animals and add the animals brought in over the period.

Initially, the farm has:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ chickens} = 70 \text{ animals} \]

Over three weeks, which is 21 days, Milkie Cows Limited brings in:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

And Broilers Limited brings in:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Adding these to the initial count:
\[ 70 \text{ initial animals} + 420 \text{ cows} + 210 \text{ chickens} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[ 700 \]"
"To determine the cost per bagel after applying the discount, we start by calculating the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Each pack costs $10.00, so for 4 packs, the total cost is:

\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we apply the 10% discount to the total cost of $40.00. The discount amount is:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the final cost:

\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how many bagels Russell gets with the 4 packs. Since each pack contains 9 bagels, the total number of bagels is:

\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find the cost per bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

Thus, the cost per single bagel is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine how many potatoes Gomer ate, we start by calculating the number of scoops he consumed. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be expressed as:

\[
23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. This is calculated as:

\[
3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops}
\]

Given that it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can set up a proportion to find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. The proportion is:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ potatoes}
\]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we'll break the problem into two parts based on the number of eggs he eats each day.

1. **First 30 days:**
   Chester eats 3 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs in the first 30 days} = 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

2. **Next 30 days:**
   Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
   \[
   \text{Total eggs in the next 30 days} = 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

3. **Total eggs over 60 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total eggs} = 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert total eggs to dozens:**
   Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs,
   \[
   \text{Total dozens of eggs} = \frac{240 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20 \, \text{dozen}

"To determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of green jellybeans, which is given as 17.
2. Calculate the number of red jellybeans, which is twice the number of green jellybeans. Therefore, the number of red jellybeans is \(2 \times 17 = 34\).
3. The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60.
4. Subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans to find the number of blue jellybeans. This calculation is \(60 - (17 + 34) = 60 - 51 = 9\).

Thus, the number of blue jellybeans is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of lemons collected from one tree in one year:**
   \[
   \text{Lemons per tree per year} = 6
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of lemons collected from all trees in one year:**
   \[
   \text{Total lemons per year} = \text{Number of trees} \times \text{Lemons per tree per year}
   \]
   Given that Tim grows 5 trees:
   \[
   \text{Total lemons per year} = 5 \times 6 = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of lemons collected in a decade:**
   A decade is 10 years. Therefore, we multiply the total lemons collected in one year by 10:
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = \text{Total lemons per year} \times 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = 30 \times 10 = 300
   \]

Thus, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:
\[
\boxed{300}

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio of men to women, which is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of parts in the ratio is 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

Given that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84, we can determine the number of women on the bus. Each part of the ratio represents an equal share of the total passengers. Therefore, the number of women is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of women} = \left(\frac{9}{14}\right) \times 84 = 9 \times 6 = 54
\]

Next, we are told that 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop. To find the number of women remaining on the bus, we subtract the number of women who alighted from the initial number of women:

\[
\text{Number of women remaining} = 54 - 20 = 34
\]

Thus, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we start by calculating the number of sunflowers sold per day. 

First, we find the number of bouquets sold per day:
\[ \text{Number of bouquets sold per day} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Next, we calculate the number of sunflowers in these bouquets:
\[ \text{Sunflowers in bouquets per day} = 7 \times 12 = 84 \]

Then, we find the number of sunflowers sold from the sunflowers alone:
\[ \text{Sunflowers sold from sunflowers per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Adding these together gives the total number of sunflowers sold per day:
\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold per day} = 13 + 84 = 97 \]

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:
\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold after 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291 \]

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is \(\boxed{291}\)."
"To determine how much money Adam loses, we start by calculating the number of rocks he can buy with $100. Each rock costs $5, so:

\[
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

Adam buys 20 rocks and then sells 60% of them. The number of rocks he sells is:

\[
\text{Number of rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12
\]

The revenue from selling these 12 rocks at $7 each is:

\[
\text{Revenue from selling 12 rocks} = 12 \times 7 = 84
\]

Adam's initial investment was $100, and he sells 12 rocks for $84. Therefore, the money left after selling the rocks is:

\[
\text{Money left} = 100 - 84 = 16
\]

The amount of money Adam loses is the difference between his initial investment and the money left:

\[
\text{Money lost} = 100 - 84 = 16
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"To determine the probability that both tickets are winners, we start by identifying the probabilities for each ticket individually.

1. **Probability of winning the first ticket:**
   The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   P(\text{Winning first ticket}) = 0.20
   \]

2. **Probability of winning the second ticket:**
   The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of winning the second ticket is:
   \[
   P(\text{Winning second ticket}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
   \]

3. **Probability that both tickets are winners:**
   Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:
   \[
   P(\text{Both tickets are winners}) = P(\text{Winning first ticket}) \times P(\text{Winning second ticket})
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   P(\text{Both tickets are winners}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. **Expressing the probability as a percentage:**
   To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
   \]

Thus, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
\[
\boxed{12\%}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the information provided:

- Let \( C \) represent the number of seashells Carlos collected.
- Let \( J \) represent the number of seashells Jim collected.
- Let \( R \) represent the number of seashells Carrey collected.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Jim collected 27 seashells, so \( J = 27 \).
2. Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so \( J = C + 5 \). Substituting \( J = 27 \), we get \( 27 = C + 5 \). Solving for \( C \), we find \( C = 22 \).
3. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so \( C = 2R \). Substituting \( C = 22 \), we get \( 22 = 2R \). Solving for \( R \), we find \( R = 11 \).

The total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ C + J + R = 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Thus, each person got 20 seashells. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to sum the carrots he eats on weekdays and the carrots he eats on weekends.

First, let's calculate the total for the weekdays:
- Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday.
- There are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Therefore, the total carrots eaten on weekdays is \(4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots}\).

Next, let's calculate the total for the weekend:
- Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday.
- There are 2 days in the weekend.
- Therefore, the total carrots eaten on the weekend is \(5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots}\).

Now, we sum the carrots eaten on weekdays and the weekend:
- Total carrots eaten in a week = Carrots eaten on weekdays + Carrots eaten on the weekend
- Total carrots eaten in a week = \(20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots}\).

Thus, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 30.

The final answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find the total time of the cassette, we start by calculating the duration of the second song. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. Therefore, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes and add it to the original 5 minutes.

First, calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, add this to the original 5 minutes:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 8 minutes long.

Next, add the durations of both songs to find the total time of the cassette:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
"To calculate Linus's profit, we follow these steps:

1. **Determine the selling price of one mobile device:**
   - Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount.
   - Therefore, the selling price is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the mobile devices Linus bought:**
   - Last Monday, he bought 2 devices.
   - Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices.
   - Total cost is \(2 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 40 + 80 = 120\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the mobile devices:**
   - Total number of devices sold is \(2 + 4 = 6\).
   - Total revenue is \(6 \times 40 = 240\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.
   - Profit is \(240 - 120 = 120\) dollars.

Therefore, the profit Linus was able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is \(\boxed{120}\) dollars."
"To determine the length of Carl's cane, we start by finding the height of Ned. Given that Isabel is 7 feet tall and Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, we calculate Ned's height as follows:

\[ \text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Therefore, we can calculate Carl's height as:

\[ \text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, we find the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2:

\[ \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet."
"To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce, we start by calculating the total number of bottles required to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people. Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle, so 100% of a person's daily energy demand is covered by 5 bottles. Therefore, for 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:

\[ 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles} \]

Next, we need to find out how many more bottles are required by subtracting the current production from the total required:

\[ 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles} \]

Thus, Hortex would need to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7300}
\]"
"To determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we start by calculating the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:

- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
\[ 1 + 2 = 3 \]

To find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we use the following formula:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately \( 66.67\% \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 66.67 \]"
"To determine the number of tax reports received on Wednesday, we start with the total number of reports received last week, which is 5168. We then subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday.

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

"Abraham initially owns 80 square meters of unused land.

1. **First Sale:**
   He sold half of his land for $50.
   \[
   \text{Area sold in the first sale} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   The price per square meter for the first sale is:
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

2. **Second Sale:**
   He sold another 1/4 of his land for $30.
   \[
   \text{Area sold in the second sale} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   The price per square meter for the second sale is:
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

3. **Remaining Land:**
   After the first and second sales, the remaining land is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining area} = 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   Abraham sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from remaining land} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Revenue:**
   Summing up the revenue from all sales:
   \[

   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is **140 dollars**."
"To determine Geb's age, we start with the given information: Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley, and Haley is 26 years old. We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:

\[ G = \frac{1}{2}H - 10 \]

Substituting Haley's age (\( H = 26 \)) into the equation:

\[ G = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 - 10 \]

First, calculate half of Haley's age:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

Then, subtract 10 from this value:

\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of face masks used per outing:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - Therefore, for each outing, he uses 2 face masks.

2. **Calculate the number of face masks used per day:**
   - Tyrion goes out three times a day.
   - For each outing, he uses 2 face masks.
   - Therefore, the number of face masks used per day is:
     \[
     3 \text{ outings/day} \times 2 \text{ face masks/outing} = 6 \text{ face masks/day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of face masks used in 2 days:**
   - If Tyrion uses 6 face masks per day, then in 2 days, he will use:
     \[
     6 \text{ face masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ face masks}
     \]

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the lengths of the ropes in terms of a variable. Let's denote the length of the yellow rope as \( Y \) centimeters. According to the problem, the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so we can express the length of the blue rope \( B \) as:
\[ B = Y - 7 \]

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can express the length of the red rope \( R \) as:
\[ R = 4B \]

The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( B \) in terms of \( Y \) into the combined length equation, we get:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Since \( B = Y - 7 \), we substitute \( B \) in the equation:
\[ 5(Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5Y - 35 + Y = 37 \]
\[ 6Y - 35 = 37 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we can find the lengths of the blue and red ropes:
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Given the problem, we start by defining the initial amounts of money given to Ronnie and Rissa. We know that Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given three times as much, which is $15.

Let \( x \) be the amount of money each of them gave to their little sister. After giving \( x \) to their sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money. Therefore, we can write the equation for Rissa's remaining money as:
\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 15 - 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

Now, we know that each of them gave \( x = 3 \) dollars to their little sister. Therefore, the amount of money left with Ronnie is:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of money left in Ronnie's money is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total, and it is divided such that half is yellow, we have 6 pints of yellow paint. Since the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, let's denote the amount of each of these paints as \( R \). Therefore, we have:

\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the term with \( R \):

\[ 3R = 6 \]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( R \):

\[ R = 2 \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used is \( 2 \) pints. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"

"To determine the number of students not on varsity, we start by calculating the number of girls and boys on varsity.

- One-third of the 12 girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

- One-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we find the number of girls and boys not on varsity.

- Number of girls not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

- Number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of students not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

Thus, the number of students not on varsity is:

"To determine how many face masks Johnny bought, we start with the number of face masks Mike bought, which is 5. Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

First, we calculate thrice the number of face masks Mike bought:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Next, we add 2 to this amount to find out how many face masks Johnny bought:
\[ 15 + 2 = 17 \]

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks. 

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we start by identifying the number of teeth drilled and capped. The dentist drills 4 teeth and caps 7 more teeth than he drills, making the total number of teeth capped \(4 + 7 = 11\). Therefore, the total number of teeth fixed is \(4 + 11 = 15\).

Next, we calculate the percentage of teeth fixed by using the formula for percentage:
\[
\text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
\]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[
\text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To calculate the refund amount, we start by determining the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon, so the total cost is:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much milk passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk he purchased. The amount of milk returned is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned. Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the refund amount is:

\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus received in refunds is:

\[
\boxed{5600}

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the given conditions. Let \( C \) represent Colin's current age and \( W \) represent Wendy's current age.

From the first statement, ""Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now,"" we can write:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement, ""In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now,"" we can write:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we solve the first equation for \( W \):
\[ W = 5C + 35 \]

Next, we substitute \( W = 5C + 35 \) into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35) \]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5C + 35 \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) and 35 from both sides:
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Thus, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

To verify, we substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
\[ W = 5(20 + 7) \]
\[ W = 5 \times 27 \]
\[ W = 135 \]

2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)
\[ 20 + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]
\[ 45 = 45 \]

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that Colin's current age is indeed \( 20 \).

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we start by calculating the total number of books he can purchase with $27,000. Given that he can buy 100 books for $500, we first find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy with $27,000:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

This means he can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Therefore, the total number of books he can buy is:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Next, we need to distribute these 5400 books equally among the 3 schools:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

Thus, Bob can buy 1800 books per school. The final answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"
"Let's carefully recount the sequence of events to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial apples**: Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 2

2. **First interaction**:
   - Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 1 (remaining apple)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1 (pocketed apple) + 1 (thrown apple) = 2

3. **Second interaction**:
   - Newton picked up the remaining apple, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 0 (all apples thrown)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 2 (pocketed apples) + 1 (thrown apple) = 3

4. **Third interaction**:
   - Newton picked up all the remaining apples (6 more apples fell out of the tree).
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 3 (pocketed apples) + 6 (picked up apples) = 9

Therefore, Newton brought home 9 apples.

"To find the total cost of the coal Ali ordered, we start by determining the number of 50 kg bags in 850 kg of coal. This is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is \(\boxed{306}\) dollars."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we'll calculate the total slices consumed by her 6 friends and then figure out how many whole pizzas are required.

First, let's calculate the total slices of cheese pizza consumed:
- Each friend eats 6 slices of cheese pizza.
- There are 6 friends.
- Therefore, the total slices of cheese pizza consumed is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) slices.
- Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is \(\frac{36}{12} = 3\) pizzas.

Next, let's calculate the total slices of pepperoni pizza consumed:
- Each friend eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza.
- There are 6 friends.
- Therefore, the total slices of pepperoni pizza consumed is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) slices.
- Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \(\frac{24}{8} = 3\) pizzas.

Adding the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas together:
- Cheese pizzas needed: 3
- Pepperoni pizzas needed: 3
- Total pizzas needed: \(3 + 3 = 6\)

Therefore, Kate needs to buy \(\boxed{6}\) pizzas."
"To determine the total miles Sam ran this week, we sum the miles he ran on each day:

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. Therefore, for these three days, the total is:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}
  \]

- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. Therefore, for these two days, the total is:
  \[
  5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}
  \]

Adding these totals together gives:
\[
9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}

"To determine how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for his production rate and the rate at which the snowballs melt.

1. **Rate of Snowball Production:**
   Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Rate of Snowball Melt:**
   2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. In one hour (60 minutes), the number of 15-minute intervals is:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 4 \text{ intervals}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of snowballs that melt in one hour is:
   \[
   2 \text{ snowballs/interval} \times 4 \text{ intervals} = 8 \text{ snowballs}
   \]

3. **Net Snowball Production per Hour:**
   The net number of snowballs Jay produces in one hour is:
   \[
   20 \text{ snowballs} - 8 \text{ snowballs} = 12 \text{ snowballs}
   \]

4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs:**
   To find out how many hours it takes to produce 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net production rate:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."
"Given that John is currently 28 years old and he was twice as old as Jim when the show came out, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \text{John's age when the show came out} = 2J \]
\[ \text{John's current age} = 28 \]

Since the difference in their ages is constant over time, we can write:

\[ 28 = 2J + \text{constant} \]

However, since we are only interested in the age difference and not the exact time when the show came out, we can directly solve for \( J \) using the fact that John's current age is twice Jim's age at that time:

\[ 2J = 28 \]

Solving for \( J \):

\[ J = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Thus, Jim is currently 14 years old. 

The final numerical answer is:

14"
"Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice, her sister ate 1 more than her, and her brother ate 1 more than her sister. To find out how many slices of apple they all ate, we can calculate as follows:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
- Her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices eaten is \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).

Therefore, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is 6."
"To determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, let's trace the bandage usage and orders step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 + 100 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used \(81 - 78 = 3\) bandages more than they needed to reach 78 bandages.

Since they had 81 bandages after ordering and using 25, and they ended up with 78, it means they used 3 more bandages than necessary. This confirms the calculations.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{62}
\]"
"To determine the total cost for May's haircut and color, we need to break down the problem into two parts: the cost of the hair color and the cost of the haircut.

1. **Cost of the Hair Color:**
   - The cost for the hair color is given as $40.

2. **Cost of the Haircut:**
   - May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so the length of hair cut is \(10 - 8 = 2\) inches.
   - The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch.
   - Therefore, the cost of the haircut is \(2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars/inch} = 60 \text{ dollars}\).

3. **Total Cost:**
   - Adding the cost of the hair color and the cost of the haircut, we get \(40 + 60 = 100\) dollars.

Thus, the total cost for May's haircut and color is \(\boxed{100}\) dollars."
"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we'll break down the calculation step by step.

First, we calculate Jen's daily earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Daily earnings = 7.5 hours/day * $1.5/hour = $11.25/day

Next, we calculate her weekly earnings:
- Jen works 6 days a week.

Weekly earnings = $11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.50/week

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, we calculate her total earnings for the month:
- Total earnings for April = $67.50/week * 4 weeks = $270.00

Additionally, Jen receives an extra $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she did not incur any absences for April, she will receive this bonus for 4 weeks:
- Total attendance bonus for April = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40.00

Finally, we add her total earnings for the month and her total attendance bonus:
- Total amount Jen will receive = $270.00 + $40.00 = $310.00

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{310}

"To calculate Jason's earnings, we'll sum the earnings from each task he completed over the two-week period.

1. **Earnings from doing laundry:**
   Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from laundry} = 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room:**
   Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} = 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Earnings from taking the trash out:**
   Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out each week. Since he took the trash out twice in the two-week period:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from taking the trash out} = 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:**
   Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher each time. Since he emptied the dishwasher 6 times:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher} = 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Jason earned is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we start by calculating the blood volume of one shark. Given that a whale has 40 gallons of blood and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we calculate the blood volume of one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, to find the total blood volume for ten sharks, we multiply the blood volume of one shark by ten:

\[ \text{Total blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"

4. **Evening Entry:** 3 times the number of people who came in first, which is \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people

Now, we add all these numbers together:

\[ 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 \]

Therefore, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is:

\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"To determine the total number of pens Alain has, we start by calculating the number of red pens. Given that Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and each pack contains 5 pens, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we calculate the number of packs of black pens. Since she bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens, the number of packs of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack of black pens also contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Adding the number of red pens and black pens together gives the total number of pens:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the cost per bottle of scotch. Given that John buys 10 bottles for a total of $600, the cost per bottle of scotch is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost per bottle of cognac, which is 50% more than the cost of scotch:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as scotch, he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

The total cost for the cognac is then:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the cost of the scotch and the cognac gives us the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2400}

"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means he planted \(2 \times 20 = 40\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, so he planted \(20 + 10 = 30\) White Oak trees.
   - On the second day, he planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. This means he planted \(40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50\) Lodgepole Pine trees.

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - The total number of White Oak trees planted over the two days is \(20 + 30 = 50\).
   - The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days is \(40 + 50 = 90\).
   - Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(50 + 90 = 140\).

The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is \(\boxed{140}\)."

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes, and then find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes.

1. **Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:**
   - There are 66 fish in total.
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes:**
   - Total number of fish = 66
   - Number of fish with red stripes = 22
   \[
   \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20

When her sister steals one of the palettes, which contains 4 colors, the number of colors left is:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[\frac{6}{2} = 3\]

Subtracting these used colors from the remaining total gives:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"Given that Mattison is 60 inches tall, and his two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, the total height of the house is:

\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison is, so the height of the first floor is:

\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is the sum of the heights of the first and second floors, the height of the second floor is:

\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas, which is 40% of the total 700 shells.
   \[
   \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280
   \]

2. Subtract the shells found by Alphas from the total to find the remaining shells.
   \[
   \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420
   \]

3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders, which is 60% of the remaining 420 shells.
   \[
   \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252
   \]

4. Subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells to find the number of shells found by team Gogetters.
   \[
   \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 420 - 252 = 168
   \]

Therefore, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is 168."
"To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we start with the information that the average distance all four dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. This means the total distance walked by all four dogs is:

\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

We know the distances for the first three dogs:
- The first dog needs to walk 1 mile.
- The second dog needs to walk 4 miles.
- The third dog needs to walk 3 miles.

Adding these distances together gives:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find the distance the fourth (and last) dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance walked by all four dogs:
\[ 12 - 8 = 4 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. The correct answer is:

4 miles"
"To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we start by calculating the loan amount he gets. The loan is 40% of the value of his house, which is $250,000.

\[
\text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

Next, we determine how much John uses to pay off his debts, which is 60% of the loan amount.

\[
\text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

To find out how much money John has leftover, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount.

\[
\text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

Therefore, the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is **$40,000**."
"To determine Deandre's earnings, we first calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. The weights of the tunas are 56 kg, 46 kg, and 26 kg. Adding these weights together gives:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these tunas. Given that each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, the total cost is:

\[ 128 \text{ kg} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kg} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars after selling all the tunas."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. The cost price of the magazines is $72.

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99
   \]

   So, the selling price is $99.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
   \]

   Substitute the values:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27
   \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To find the total amount of water removed by the dehumidifier, we need to calculate the water removed each day for each setting and then sum these amounts over the specified periods.

1. **Low setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes 1 liter of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the low setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the low setting: \( 1 \text{ liter/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 3 \text{ liters} \).

2. **Medium setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day on the medium setting as on the low setting.
   - Therefore, the medium setting removes \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the medium setting for 3 days.
   - Total water removed on the medium setting: \( 2 \text{ liters/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ liters} \).

3. **High setting:**
   - The dehumidifier removes twice as much water per day on the high setting as on the medium setting.
   - Therefore, the high setting removes \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \) liters of water per day.
   - Brian ran the dehumidifier on the high setting for 5 days.
   - Total water removed on the high setting: \( 4 \text{ liters/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ liters} \).

Now, we sum the total water removed over all settings:
\[
3 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} + 20 \text{ liters} = 29 \text{ liters}
\]

Thus, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is \(\boxed{29}\) liters."
"To determine how many balloons were thrown, we start with the total number of balloons initially filled, which is 10 packs times 30 balloons per pack, giving us 300 balloons. By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons remained unused. Therefore, the number of balloons thrown is calculated by subtracting the remaining balloons from the total number of balloons:

\[
300 - 12 = 288
\]

Thus, the number of balloons thrown is \(\boxed{288}\)."

1. The first medicine amount is 14 mL.
2. The second medicine amount is 3 times the first medicine amount, which is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) mL.
3. The total amount of medicine in one dose is \(14 + 42 = 56\) mL.
4. The total amount of medicine in 8 doses is \(8 \times 56 = 448\) mL.

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is \(\boxed{448}\) mL."
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we start by determining the capacity of Ali's class, which is given as 120 students.

Next, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes, which is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class. Therefore:

\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Adding the capacities of Ali's class and John's classes gives us the combined capacity:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}

"To determine how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Stephen will return to his sister.
2. Determine the total amount Stephen will pay over the first 11 months.
3. Subtract the amount paid over the first 11 months from the total amount to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Stephen will return.**

Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. The interest amount is:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]
So, the total amount Stephen will return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount Stephen will pay over the first 11 months.**

Stephen will pay $25 per month for the first 11 months. The total amount paid over these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.**

The amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he will return minus the amount he has already paid over the first 11 months:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the length of the shorter piece as \( x \) feet. Consequently, the length of the longer piece is \( 4x \) feet, given that it is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.

The total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, which is 40 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece is 4 times the length of the shorter piece:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the information provided. Let \( C \) represent the number of cupcakes and \( B \) represent the number of brownies. According to the problem, we have:

1. \( B = 3C - 2 \)
2. The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 10, so \( C + B = 10 \).

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ C + 3C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Thus, Carly made 3 cupcakes. To verify, if \( C = 3 \), then:
\[ B = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \]
The total number of treats is:
\[ C + B = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

This confirms that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:

\]

Next, we apply the 20% discount for getting both services together:
\[
20\% \text{ of } 75 = 0.20 \times 75 = 15
\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost:
\[
75 - 15 = 60
\]

Karen also wants to add nail art to each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total, and each nail art service costs $3:
\[
10 \times 3 = 30

- Let \( K \) represent the number of paintings Kim has.
- Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Shelley has \( K + 8 \) paintings.
- Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings.

We can set up the equation based on the information about Samantha:
\[ K + 8 - 12 = 27 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ K - 4 = 27 \]

To solve for \( K \), we add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ K = 27 + 4 \]
\[ K = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the final price of the toy after the price changes in November, December, and January, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price in December:**
   - The original price in November is $40.
   - The price increased by 80% in December.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Adding this increase to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72
     \]
   - Therefore, the price in December is $72.

2. **Calculate the price in January:**
   - The price in December is $72.
   - The price decreased by 50% in January.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72:
     \[
     0.50 \times 72 = 36
     \]
   - Subtracting this decrease from the December price:
     \[
     72 - 36 = 36

   - Therefore, the price in January is $36.

The final price of the toy after it was discounted in January is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"To determine the total amount of money Charlie makes for the day, we'll break down the calculations step by step.

First, we calculate the earnings from the standard lessons:
- Charlie has 4 lessons at a standard rate of $80 per hour.
- Therefore, the total for the standard lessons is:
  \[
  4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Next, we calculate the earnings from the lessons given to veterans:
- The reduced rate for veteran lessons is 25% off the standard rate, which means the rate is 75% of $80.
- The reduced rate is:
  \[
  80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour}
  \]
- Charlie has 2 lessons at this reduced rate.
- Therefore, the total for the veteran lessons is:
  \[
  2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both types of lessons to find the total amount of money Charlie makes for the day:
\[
320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is \(\boxed{440}\)."
"To find Sally's mean score, we first sum all her quiz scores: \(50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60\).

Let's add these step by step:
\[
50 + 80 = 130
\]
\[
130 + 80 = 210
\]
\[
210 + 60 = 270
\]
\[
270 + 40 = 310
\]
\[
310 + 90 = 400
\]
\[
400 + 100 = 500
\]
\[
500 + 70 = 570
\]
\[
570 + 60 = 630
\]

The sum of all the scores is \(630\). Since there are 9 scores, we calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the number of scores:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{630}{9} = 70
\]

Therefore, Sally's mean score is \(\boxed{70}\)."

"To find the number of novels Regina has written this year, we start with the information that 9 novels are 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year. This can be represented as:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} x \]

To solve for \( x \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ 9 \times 4 = 3x \]
\[ 36 = 3x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 3 to isolate \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{36}{3} \]
\[ x = 12 \]

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we start by calculating the total distance he travels in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

First, calculate the total time spent traveling in hours:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

Next, calculate the total distance traveled:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

Now, determine the percentage of the total distance (6000 km) that this distance represents:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is:
\[ 60\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to account for all the grapes used and eaten. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Grapes eaten by Madeline:** Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. **Grapes used by her brother:** Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, which is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. **Grapes remaining after her brother:** The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes. Therefore, the number of grapes remaining is the total number of grapes at the beginning minus 36.
4. **Grapes used to make pies:** Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Thus, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.
5. **Total grapes at the beginning:** Since the remaining grapes after her brother used his share are used to make the pies, we can set up the equation: \(\text{Total grapes at the beginning} - 36 = 48\). Solving for the total number of grapes at the beginning, we get \(\text{Total grapes at the beginning} = 48 + 36 = 84\).

Thus, the total number of grapes at the beginning is \(\boxed{84}\)."
"To determine the number of teachers at school on the day in question, we start with the total number of teachers, which is 82. Out of these, 13 were sick, so we subtract the sick teachers from the total:

\[ 82 - 13 = 69 \]

Next, we add the number of substitute teachers, which is 9, to the remaining teachers:

\[ 69 + 9 = 78 \]

Therefore, the number of teachers at school that day is 78."
"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we start by calculating the weekly cost of ingredients.

First, we identify the costs:
- The cost of pasta is $1.00 per box.
- The cost of cheddar cheese is $3.00.
- The cost of gruyere cheese is twice the cost of cheddar cheese, which is \(2 \times 3.00 = 6.00\) dollars.

Next, we sum these costs to find the total weekly cost:
\[
1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
\]

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the weekly cost is $10.00.

To find the annual cost, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year (52 weeks):
\[
10.00 \times 52 = 520.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:
\[
\boxed{520.00}

"To determine the percentage of their day, on average, that the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we start by calculating the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time in minutes is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert this total time into hours, knowing that there are 60 minutes in an hour:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total cleaning time}}{\text{Workday time}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

Therefore, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms. This result indicates that the custodian works more than one full workday in the given 5 days, which is not practical. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{250\%} \]"
"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we first calculate the total capacity of one bookcase. The bookcase has four shelves: two middle shelves each holding 10 books, one bottom shelf holding twice as many books as a middle shelf, and one top shelf holding 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.

1. **Capacity of the middle shelves:**
   - Each middle shelf holds 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves.
   - Total capacity of the middle shelves = \(10 \times 2 = 20\) books.

2. **Capacity of the bottom shelf:**
   - The bottom shelf holds twice as many books as a middle shelf.
   - Total capacity of the bottom shelf = \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.

3. **Capacity of the top shelf:**
   - The top shelf holds 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
   - Total capacity of the top shelf = \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

4. **Total capacity of one bookcase:**
   - Sum of the capacities of all shelves = \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

5. **Number of bookcases needed:**
   - Elly has 110 books.
   - Number of bookcases needed = \(\frac{110}{55} = 2\).

Therefore, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all of her books. The final answer is:
\[

"To determine Rose's profit, we start by calculating the total cost of the eggs she bought. Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and each dozen costs $2.40. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of eggs Rose has, which is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total selling price is:

\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining hats after removing red hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Number of blue hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **Number of white hats**: Subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20

"To find the cost per stick of beef jerky in cents, we start by calculating the discounted price of the bag. The original price is $18.00, and with a $3.00 discount, the price becomes $15.00. Since the bag contains 30 sticks, we divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick in dollars:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

To convert this cost into cents, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents per stick} \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky in cents is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we start by calculating the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct:

\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test. The total number of questions on both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to answer 70% of these 110 questions correctly:

\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes, we start with the given information and set up the equations accordingly. Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes and \( B \) represent the number of blueberry cubes. According to the problem, we have:

1. \( B = 5S - 4 \)
2. \( S + B = 116 \)

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):
\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is \( 96 \)."

The number of marbles Brendan ended up with is 7."
"To determine the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we'll follow a step-by-step approach using the given ratios.

1. **Calculate the number of customers needed:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - To sell 15 cars, the number of customers required is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 8 customers.

2. **Calculate the number of telephone calls needed:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - To get 8 customers, the number of telephone calls needed is:
     \[
     8 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 200 \text{ calls}

     \]

2. **Number of Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each.
   - Half of 8 rooms is:
     \[
     \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ rooms}
     \]
   - For the 4 rooms with 4 small candles each:
     \[
     4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ candles per room} = 16 \text{ small candles}
     \]
   - For the 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each:
     \[
     4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ candles per room} = 20 \text{ medium candles}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

Adding these to the initial total:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Thus, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"To determine the number of lemons Tim needs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total lemon juice required:**
   - Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice.
   - Therefore, the total lemon juice needed is:
     \[
     4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Account for the extra, twice as tart lemonade:**
   - Tim needs to make an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the other gallons.
   - This extra gallon also requires 1 cup of lemon juice.

3. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed for the extra tart lemonade:**
   - Since the extra lemonade is twice as tart, it still requires 1 cup of lemon juice.

4. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed for all lemonade:**
   - The total lemon juice needed is:
     \[
     4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups}
     \]

5. **Determine the number of lemons needed:**
   - Each cup of lemon juice requires 6 lemons.
   - Therefore, the total number of lemons needed is:
     \[
     5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons}
     \]

Thus, Tim will need \(\boxed{30}\) lemons."
"To determine the total amount of dog food needed in a week, we start by calculating the daily consumption for both German Shepherds and Bulldogs.

First, we calculate the daily consumption for the German Shepherds:
- There are 3 German Shepherds.
- Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day.

\[
\text{Daily consumption for German Shepherds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we calculate the daily consumption for the Bulldogs:
- There are 2 Bulldogs.
- Each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day.

\[
\text{Daily consumption for Bulldogs} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, we add the daily consumption of both breeds to find the total daily consumption:

\[
\text{Total daily consumption} = 15 \text{ kg} + 6 \text{ kg} = 21 \text{ kg}
\]

To find the weekly consumption, we multiply the total daily consumption by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):

\[
\text{Weekly consumption} = 21 \times 7 = 147 \text{ kg}
\]

Thus, the total amount of dog food needed in a week is:

\[
\boxed{147}

"To find the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm, we first calculate the total number of legs contributed by each type of animal.

For the 2-legged animals:
- There are 10 animals, each with 2 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 2-legged animals is \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.

For the 4-legged animals:
- There are 15 animals, each with 4 legs.
- Therefore, the total number of legs from the 4-legged animals is \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs.

Adding these together gives the total number of legs:
- Total number of legs = \(20 + 60 = 80\) legs.

To find the number of pairs of legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
- Number of pairs of legs = \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) pairs.

Thus, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To determine the number of red blocks in the tower, we start with the given information:

- The number of blue blocks is 4.
- The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks, which is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).
- The total number of blocks is 32.

We can express the total number of blocks as the sum of the blue, yellow, and red blocks:

\[ \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} + \text{Number of red blocks} = \text{Total number of blocks} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 4 + 8 + R = 32 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 12 + R = 32 \]

To find \( R \), we subtract 12 from both sides:

\[ R = 32 - 12 \]

\[ R = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of red blocks is 20."
"To determine how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the net distance traveled after his journey.

First, we calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- Elvis drove west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, we calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- Elvis drove east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

To find the net distance from his starting point, we subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final numerical answer is:
54"
"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we will calculate the depreciation year by year, starting with the initial value of $9000.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."
"To determine the number of pink candies, we start by identifying the quantities of each color of candy in the bag. We know the total number of candies is 232. The number of red candies is given as 54. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, which means there are \(2 \times 54 = 108\) orange candies. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, which means there are \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\) yellow candies.

Next, we calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
54 \text{ (red)} + 108 \text{ (orange)} + 27 \text{ (yellow)} = 189
\]

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[
232 - 189 = 43
\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"To determine the total cost Helen paid for her trip, we'll break down the expenses step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of one night at the hotel:
\[ \text{Cost of one night at the hotel} = \$80 \]

Next, we find the cost of one bus trip, which is 10% of the hotel cost:
\[ \text{Cost of one bus trip} = 10\% \times \$80 = 0.10 \times \$80 = \$8 \]

Since Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ \text{Total cost for hotel} = 3 \times \$80 = \$240 \]

For the bus trips, Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:
\[ \text{Total cost for bus trips} = 7 \times \$8 = \$56 \]

Adding the total costs for the hotel and the bus trips gives us the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

Therefore, the final amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"

   \]

2. **Total cost for 10 jars:**
   \[
   44 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 440 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Revenue from selling 10 jars:**
   \[
   50 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Profit:**
   \[
   500 \text{ dollars} - 440 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the profit Tim makes selling 10 jars is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we calculate the value of each type of coin and sum these values.

1. **Quarters:**
   - Justin has 32 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - Total value of quarters = \( 32 \times 0.25 = 8 \) dollars.

2. **Dimes:**
   - Justin has 95 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes = \( 95 \times 0.10 = 9.50 \) dollars.

3. **Nickels:**
   - Justin has 120 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels = \( 120 \times 0.05 = 6 \) dollars.

4. **Pennies:**
   - Justin has 750 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies = \( 750 \times 0.01 = 7.50 \) dollars.

Now, we sum the values of all the coins:
\[ 8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31.00 \]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31.00}\)."
"To determine how much money Janet has left after her expenditures, we start by summing up her total expenses:

- Ice cream: $3.50
- Movie tickets: $7.50 each for two, so $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
- Bracelet: $8.50

Adding these expenses together:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract her total expenses from the $40:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

Therefore, Janet has $13.00 left."
"To determine Josh's earnings over 2 weeks, we start by calculating his daily earnings. Since he services 3 cars a day and gets paid $4 per car, his daily earnings are:

\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 12 \text{ dollars/day} \]

Next, we find out how many days he works in a week. He works every day except Sunday and Wednesday, so he works:

\[ 7 \text{ days/week} - 2 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ days/week} \]

Thus, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 12 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Finally, to find his earnings over 2 weeks, we multiply his weekly earnings by 2:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Josh makes in 2 weeks is:

\[ 120 \]"
"Randy initially has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. After eating 1 oatmeal, 1 chocolate chip, and 1 sugar cookie for an early day snack, he has:

- Oatmeal cookies left: \(9 - 1 = 8\)
- Chocolate chip cookies left: \(4 - 1 = 3\)
- Sugar cookies left: \(5 - 1 = 4\)

For lunch, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies, leaving him with:

- Oatmeal cookies: \(8 - 2 = 6\)

Then, he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, reducing the sugar cookies to:

- Sugar cookies: \(4 - 2 = 2\)

Finally, he bakes 4 more cookies of each type for dinner, resulting in:

- Oatmeal cookies: \(6 + 4 = 10\)
- Chocolate chip cookies: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
- Sugar cookies: \(2 + 4 = 6\)

Adding these up, the total number of cookies Randy has now is:

- Total cookies: \(10 + 7 + 6 = 23\)

Therefore, the final number of cookies Randy has is 23."
"To determine how much money Matthew would earn, we need to calculate the earnings from each half of his collection separately and then sum them up.

1. Matthew has a total of 12 unique toy soldiers.
2. Half of his collection is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) toy soldiers.
3. The other half is also \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) toy soldiers.

Next, we calculate the earnings from each half:

- For the first half (6 toy soldiers at $5 each):
  \[
  6 \text{ toy soldiers} \times \$5 \text{ per toy} = \$30
  \]

- For the second half (6 toy soldiers at $7 each):
  \[
  6 \text{ toy soldiers} \times \$7 \text{ per toy} = \$42
  \]

Finally, we add the earnings from both halves to find the total amount Matthew would earn:
\[
\$30 + \$42 = \$72

"To determine how many weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation:**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = \( 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \).

2. **Determine the net change in the number of holes per day:**
   - Nate's dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate fills 9 holes per day.
   - Net change per day = \( 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \).

3. **Calculate the total number of days required to fill all the holes:**
   - Total holes = 84.
   - Net change per day = 3 holes.
   - Total days required = \( \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \).

4. **Convert the total number of days into weeks:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total weeks required = \( \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \).

Thus, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we start by calculating the enrollment at Butler High School. Given that Butler High School enrolls an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School, and Norman High School enrolls 4000 students, we calculate:

\[
\text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Next, we find the difference in enrollment between Norman High School and Butler High School:

\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1000}

"To determine the number of chocolate chip cookies made by the Adams family, we start with the total number of cookies, which is 7995. We then subtract the number of rainbow cookies (2595) and oatmeal cookies (3075) from this total.

First, we calculate the sum of the rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
\[ 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies:
\[ 7995 - 5670 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2325 \]"
"To solve the problem using algebra, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( T \) be the number of test tubes gathered,
- \( B \) be the number of beakers gathered,
- \( P \) be the number of Petri dishes gathered.

From the problem, we know:
1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, so \( T = 16 \).
2. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so \( T = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).
3. Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so \( P = 14 + 2 = 16 \).
4. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, so \( B = 7 \).
5. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

We can set up the equation for the total number of items gathered:
\[ T + B + P = 29 \]

Substituting the values of \( T \), \( B \), and \( P \):
\[ 8 + 7 + 16 = 29 \]

This confirms that the total number of items gathered is indeed 29. Since Dr. Grumpus requested 37 items (16 test tubes + 7 beakers + 14 Petri dishes) and Igor gathered 29 items, the number of items Igor lost is:
\[ 37 - 29 = 8 \]

However, since Igor gathered 7 beakers and lost a total of 6 items, the number of beakers he lost is:
\[ 7 - (29 - 16 - 14) = 7 - 1 = 1 \]

Thus, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we start by calculating the total number of screws needed for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:

\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:

\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the total number of eggs in both baskets, we start with the information given:

- The first basket contains 10 eggs.
- The second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, which means it contains \(2 \times 10 = 20\) eggs.

Adding the eggs from both baskets together, we get:
\[10 + 20 = 30\]

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30. The correct answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we start by calculating the individual contributions:

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each person to find the total amount raised:

\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

Adding these amounts together:

\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480
\]
\[
1480 + 700 = 2180
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:

\[
\boxed{2180}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and relationships given in the question. Let's denote Vanessa's speed as \( V \) miles per minute. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron's speed is \( 2V \) miles per minute.

Given that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes and ran a distance of \( 32V \) miles (since \( D_A = 2V \times 16 = 32V \)), we need to find out how long Vanessa took to run 4 miles.

Since Vanessa's speed is \( V \) miles per minute, the time she took to run 4 miles is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4}{V} \]

We know that Aaron's speed \( 2V \) allows him to run 32 miles in 16 minutes. Since the total distance they ran together is the same, we can use the relationship directly to find \( V \). However, we don't need to find \( V \) explicitly to determine the time Vanessa took. We already have the expression for the time Vanessa took, which is \( \frac{4}{V} \).

Given that \( V = 8 \) miles per minute (as derived from the relationship \( A = 2V \) and \( A \times 16 = 32V \)), we substitute \( V \) into the time equation:
\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5 \text{ minutes} \]

Converting 0.5 minutes to seconds, we get:
\[ 0.5 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ seconds} \]

Thus, Vanessa took 30 seconds to complete her part of the race. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we start by calculating the required line for the existing 200 feet of dock. Given that 3 feet of line is needed for every foot of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the 6 feet of new line that the caretaker already has from the total required line:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy an additional 594 feet of line. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 594 \]"
"To determine the weekly revenue for Tom's restaurant, we'll follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Reservations per night**: The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
2. **Reservations per day**: Since the restaurant operates 2 days a week, the number of reservations per day is:
   \[
   \frac{6 \text{ reservations/night}}{2 \text{ nights/day}} = 3 \text{ reservations/day}
   \]
3. **Reservations per week**: Over 7 days, the total number of reservations is:
   \[
   3 \text{ reservations/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]
4. **Cost per reservation**: Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine, making the total cost per reservation:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]
5. **Total weekly revenue**: Multiplying the number of reservations per week by the cost per reservation gives:
   \[
   21 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 315 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{315}

"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we start with the cost price of $80 for 50 watermelons. The vendor made a 25% profit on this cost price.

First, calculate the profit amount:
\[ \text{Profit} = 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \]

Next, add the profit to the cost price to find the total selling price:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

Finally, to find the selling price per watermelon, divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2."
"To determine the age of John's youngest son in 3 years, let's break down the information step by step using algebraic reasoning:

1. **James's Current Age**: Since Dora will be 12 in 3 years, Dora is currently 9 years old. James is twice as old as Dora, so James is currently \(2 \times 9 = 18\) years old.
2. **John's Current Age**: John was 19 when James was born, and since James is 18 years old now, John is \(18 + 19 = 37\) years old.
3. **Youngest Son's Current Age**: The youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.
4. **Youngest Son's Age in 3 Years**: In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Thus, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we start by calculating the number of oranges each can peel in one minute.

- Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an orange.
- Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so in one minute, she peels \(\frac{1}{4}\) of an orange.

Next, we calculate the number of oranges each can peel in 60 minutes (one hour):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20\) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \(60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15\) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \(20 - 15 = 5\).

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To determine the total cost Mark incurred, we start by calculating the discounted price of the radiator. The original price of the radiator is $400, and he gets it at 80% off. This means he pays 20% of the original price.

First, we calculate 20% of $400:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is $80. Next, we calculate the cost of hiring the mechanic. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install the radiator.

The total cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator after the discount to the cost of hiring the mechanic:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given information:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

Let \( C \) represent the number of chickens and \( K \) represent the number of cows. We can set up the following system of equations based on the information provided:

\[
C + K = 20
\]
\[
2C + 4K = 70
\]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:

\[
C + 2K = 35
\]

Now we have the simplified system of equations:
\[
C + K = 20
\]
\[
C + 2K = 35
\]

To eliminate \( C \), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[
(C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20
\]
\[
C + 2K - C - K = 15
\]
\[
K = 15
\]

Substituting \( K = 15 \) back into the first equation:

\[
C + 15 = 20
\]
\[
C = 5
\]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To determine how many slices of pizza each person can have, we start by calculating the total number of pizza slices available. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we need to share these 56 slices equally among Henry and his 3 friends, making a total of 4 people. Therefore, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Thus, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
