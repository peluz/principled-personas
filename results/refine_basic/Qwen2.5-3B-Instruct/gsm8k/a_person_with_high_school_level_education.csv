"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so that leaves her with:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \text{ eggs} \]

Then, she uses 4 eggs to make muffins, so now she has:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

These 9 eggs are what she sells at the farmers' market. She sells each egg for $2, so she makes:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"To figure out how many bolts of fiber are needed for the robe, we need to add up the blue and white fiber.

- The robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- It needs half as much white fiber as blue fiber, so it needs \(2 / 2 = 1\) bolt of white fiber.

Now, we add the blue and white fiber together:
- Blue fiber: 2 bolts
- White fiber: 1 bolt

So, the total number of bolts needed is:
\[2 + 1 = 3\]

Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is 3."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Josh buys a house for $80,000 and spends $50,000 on repairs. So, the total cost is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

The repairs and work make the house worth 150% more. To find out how much more, we calculate 150% of $130,000:
\[ 150\% \text{ of } 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the new value of the house is:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

To find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract the original cost from the new value:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

So, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

James runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters long. So, if he runs 3 sprints, he runs:
\[ 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters} \]
He does this 3 times a week, so the total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ 180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week} \]

So, the total number of meters James runs in a week is 540 meters."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Wendi has 20 chickens, and she gives each chicken 3 cups of feed every day. So, the total amount of feed she needs for the whole day is:

\[ 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

In the morning, she gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total feed given in the morning and afternoon is:

\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

To find out how much feed is left for the final meal, we subtract the feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed for the day:

\[ 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

So, Wendi needs to give 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. The first glass costs $5. Every second glass costs only 60% of $5, which is $3.

So, for every pair of glasses:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs $3.
- The total cost for one pair is $5 + $3 = $8.

Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, he will have 8 pairs of glasses. So, the total cost will be:
\[ 8 \text{ pairs} \times \$8 \text{ per pair} = \$64 \]

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay \(\boxed{64}\) dollars for the 16 glasses."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step:

1. We know Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so:
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Charleston} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so:
   \[
   \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 2 \times 80 = 160
   \]
4. To find the total number of sheep in all three cities, we add the number of sheep in Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse:
   \[
   \text{Total Sheep} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
   \]

So, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is 260.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{260}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. She can download 2 GB per minute normally. First, we need to find out how much of the file she downloads before the Windows update.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB per minute, it takes \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes to download 80 GB.

2. **Windows update and restart:**
   - This takes 20 minutes.

3. **Restarting the download:**
   - After the restart, she has to start downloading the remaining 120 GB (200 GB - 80 GB).
   - At a rate of 2 GB per minute, it takes \( \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) minutes to download the remaining 120 GB.

Now, we add up all the time:
- Time for the first 40% download: 40 minutes
- Time for the Windows update and restart: 20 minutes
- Time for the remaining download: 60 minutes

Total time = \( 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 \) minutes.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"Okay, let's break down John's journey step by step to find out how far he is from home after 4 hours.

1. **First Segment:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance covered: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John spends 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - Distance covered: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 0 \text{ mph} = 0 \text{ miles}\).

3. **Third Segment:**
   - John drives for 0.5 hours at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance covered: \(0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\).

4. **Fourth Segment:**
   - John drives for the remaining time at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Total time remaining: \(4 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).
   - Distance covered: \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles}\).

Now, let's add up all the distances:
\[180 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} + 15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 315 \text{ miles}\]

So, after 4 hours, John is 315 miles from home. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{315}\)"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Eliza gets paid $10 for every hour she works. But for any hours she works over 40, she gets paid an extra 20% because it's overtime. This week, she worked 45 hours.

First, we calculate how much she earns for the first 40 hours:
- She works 40 hours at $10/hour, so that's 40 * $10 = $400.

Next, we calculate her overtime pay for the extra 5 hours:
- Her overtime rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour.
- For 5 hours at $12/hour, she earns 5 * $12 = $60.

Now, we add the regular pay and the overtime pay to find her total earnings:
- Total earnings = $400 (regular pay) + $60 (overtime pay) = $460.

So, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

In the first month, the program got 60 downloads.

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times the first month, so:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ downloads} \]

In the third month, the downloads were reduced by 30%. So, we need to find 30% of 180 and subtract that from 180:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 180 = 0.30 \times 180 = 54 \]
\[ 180 - 54 = 126 \text{ downloads} \]

Now, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the downloads from each month:
\[ 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 \]

So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 366. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{366} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out the total cost of the pastries Toula bought.

First, we calculate the cost of the donuts:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts.
- Each dozen costs $68.
- So, the cost for the donuts is \(3 \times 68 = 204\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes.
- Each dozen costs $80.
- So, the cost for the mini cupcakes is \(2 \times 80 = 160\) dollars.

Then, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes.
- Each dozen costs $55.
- So, the cost for the mini cheesecakes is \(6 \times 55 = 330\) dollars.

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total:
- Total cost = cost of donuts + cost of mini cupcakes + cost of mini cheesecakes
- Total cost = \(204 + 160 + 330 = 694\) dollars.

So, the total cost is \(\boxed{694}\) dollars."
"To figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree, we need to look at the costs and the money he makes each year.

First, let's see the costs:
- The tree costs $90 to plant.
- Each year, the tree gives him 7 lemons, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. So, the money he makes from selling lemons each year is \(7 \times 1.5 = 10.5\) dollars.
- The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

So, the net profit each year is the money he makes from lemons minus the cost to water and feed the tree:
\[10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \text{ dollars per year}\]

Now, we need to find out how many years it will take for the net profit to cover the initial cost of $90. We can set up the equation:
\[7.5 \times \text{number of years} = 90\]

To find the number of years, we divide 90 by 7.5:
\[90 \div 7.5 = 12\]

So, it will take 12 years for Carlos to start making money from his lemon tree. The answer is 12 years."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Melanie starts with some vacuum cleaners. Let's call the number of vacuum cleaners she starts with \( x \).

1. She sells a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sells \( \frac{x}{3} \) and has \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) left.

2. Then she sells 2 more at the red house. Now she has \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) left.

3. At the orange house, she sells half of what's left. So, she sells \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \). After this, she has:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - 2 - \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x}{3} + 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{2x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 6
\]
\[
x = 18
\]

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have a dance class with 20 students. First, we need to find out how many students are in contemporary dance. 20% of 20 students is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in contemporary dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these 16 students are in jazz dance. 25% of 16 students is:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students} \]

So, 4 students are in jazz dance. This leaves us with:

\[ 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ students} \]

The remaining 12 students must be in hip-hop dance. To find out what percentage 12 students are of the total 20 students, we use the formula:

\[ \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, 60% of the students are in hip-hop dance. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"To figure out which purchase will give the merchant the most profit, we need to calculate how much the jewelry and electronic gadgets will be worth after the market increases.

First, let's look at the jewelry:
- The jewelry is worth $5,000.
- The market for jewelry is expected to go up by 2.5%.
- To find out how much the jewelry will be worth after the increase, we calculate 2.5% of $5,000 and add it to the original price.
- 2.5% of $5,000 is $5,000 * 0.025 = $125.
- So, the jewelry will be worth $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.

Now, let's look at the electronic gadgets:
- The electronic gadgets are worth $8,000.
- The market for electronic gadgets is expected to go up by 1.2%.
- To find out how much the electronic gadgets will be worth after the increase, we calculate 1.2% of $8,000 and add it to the original price.
- 1.2% of $8,000 is $8,000 * 0.012 = $96.
- So, the electronic gadgets will be worth $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.

Now we can see the profit from each:
- Profit from jewelry = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.
- Profit from electronic gadgets = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96.

Since $125 is more than $96, the merchant should buy the jewelry to get the most profit.

So, the answer is that the merchant should buy the jewelry, and the profit would be $125."
"Okay, let me explain this in a simpler way.

We have two trains that travel in two different directions over two days. On the first day, they each travel 80 miles west. On the second day, they each travel 150 miles north.

To find out the total distance each train has traveled, we need to add the distances from both days together.

So, the total distance is:
\[ 80 \text{ miles (west)} + 150 \text{ miles (north)} = 230 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles."
"Okay, let me break it down simply for you.

Jill gets paid $20 per hour as a teacher and $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach. She works 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach. She works 50 weeks a year.

First, let's calculate how much she earns from teaching:
- She works 35 hours a week and there are 50 weeks in a year, so she works 35 * 50 = 1750 hours a year.
- She gets paid $20 an hour, so her annual teaching pay is 1750 * $20 = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate how much she earns from coaching:
- She works 15 hours a week and there are 50 weeks in a year, so she works 15 * 50 = 750 hours a year.
- She gets paid $30 an hour, so her annual coaching pay is 750 * $30 = $22,500.

Now, we add her teaching and coaching pay to find her total annual salary:
- Her total annual salary is $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning. There are 7 days in a week, so she uses:
\[ 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:
\[ 21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs} \]

Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen} \]

So, Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks. The final answer is:
\[ 7 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Marissa has already hiked 4 miles in 1 hour and then 2 more miles in another hour. So, she has spent 2 hours hiking so far. She wants to hike a total of 12 miles and her goal is to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

To find out how much time she has left to hike, we subtract the time she has already spent from the total time she wants to spend:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Time already spent} = 2 \text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Remaining time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Now, we know she has 1 hour left to hike the remaining distance. She has already hiked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles), so the remaining distance is:
\[ \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

To find out the speed she needs to hike the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to hike the remaining 6 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour to achieve her goal. The correct answer is:
\[ 6 \text{ miles per hour} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We start with 10 liters of orange drink. Two-thirds of this drink is water, so we calculate the amount of water in the orange drink:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, we have 15 liters of pineapple drink, and three-fifths of this drink is water:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters} \]

Now, we add the water from both drinks together:
\[ 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

But then we spill 1 liter of the orange drink, so we subtract that from the total volume:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

The total amount of water remains the same, which is 15.67 liters. To find out how much water is in the remaining 9 liters, we use the total amount of water:
\[ \frac{15.67}{9} \approx 1.74 \text{ liters per liter} \]

So, the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters is:
\[ 9 \times 1.74 = 15.67 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is:
\[ \boxed{15.67} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Samantha is 31 years old now.
2. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Raymond is 31 - 6 = 25 years old now.
3. Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. That means his son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for clarity.

Billy had 8 customers on Tuesday. Here's how many DVDs each group of customers bought:

- The first 3 customers each bought 1 DVD. So, \(3 \times 1 = 3\) DVDs.
- The next 2 customers each bought 2 DVDs. So, \(2 \times 2 = 4\) DVDs.
- The last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs, so that's \(3 \times 0 = 0\) DVDs.

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold:
\[3 + 4 + 0 = 7\]

So, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday. The final answer is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"To figure out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time the candle burns and then use the rate of melting.

1. Calculate the total time the candle burns:
   - From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a span of 4 hours.

2. Determine the rate of melting:
   - The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.

3. Calculate the total decrease in length:
   - Since the candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour, over 4 hours, the total decrease in length will be:
     \[
     2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm}
     \]

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To find the original price of the book, we know that Kyle paid $19.50 after a 25% discount. This means he paid 75% of the original price. Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

So, we have:
\[ 0.75P = 19.50 \]

To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:
\[ P = \frac{19.50}{0.75} \]

Now, let's do the division:
\[ P = 26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26.00.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of the items Marie ordered except for the boxes of pizza:
- The chicken meal costs $12.
- The 5 packs of milk cost $3 each, so that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) dollars.
- The 4 apples cost $1.50 each, so that's \(4 \times 1.50 = 6\) dollars.

Now, let's add these costs together:
\[
12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

Marie paid a total of $50. So, the cost of the boxes of pizza is:
\[
50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes Marie ordered, we divide the total cost of the pizza by the cost per box:
\[
\frac{17}{8.50} = 2
\]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"To find out how much Mishka spent in total, we need to add up the cost of the shorts, pants, and shoes she bought.

First, let's calculate the cost of the shorts:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
- Each pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- So, the total cost for the shorts is 3 * $16.50 = $59.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
- Each pair of pants costs $22.50.
- So, the total cost for the pants is 3 * $22.50 = $67.50.

Then, let's calculate the cost of the shoes:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $42.
- So, the total cost for the shoes is 3 * $42 = $126.00.

Now, we add up the total costs:
- Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00

Adding these amounts together:
- Total cost = $59.50 + $67.50 + $126.00 = $253.00

So, Mishka spent a total of $253.00 on all the clothing items.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{253}

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. She buys cartons that have 15 servings each and cost $4.00. We need to find out how much she spends on ice cream after 60 days.

First, let's see how many servings she eats in 60 days. Since she eats one serving a night, in 60 days she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many cartons she needs. Each carton has 15 servings, so we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

Each carton costs $4.00, so for 4 cartons, she will spend:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16 on ice cream. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Henry's trip is 60 miles long. He stops after 20 miles, so that's his first stop. Now, we need to find out where his second stop is. The second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the trip is 60 miles, 15 miles before the end would be 60 - 15 = 45 miles from the start.

Now, to find out how many miles he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop. So, 45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles.

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops. The answer is 25 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, so it's $66. Adding these together, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $33 + $66 = $99.

The problem states that the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. So, if we let the cost of the boots be \( B \), then we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the boots cost $104. 

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, and their total age is 162. So, if we let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), we can write the equation:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

This simplifies to:

\[18x = 162\]

To find \(x\), we divide both sides by 18:

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now we know that Darrell's age is \(7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's age is \(11 \times 9 = 99\).

To find out how old Allen will be 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

So, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we have the first friend's guess, which is 80 jelly beans.

The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.

The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we add these guesses together and then divide by the number of guesses, which is 3.

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans. The correct answer is 80."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

John takes care of 10 dogs, and each dog needs 0.5 hours a day. So, to find out how many hours he spends on one dog in a day, we multiply the number of dogs by the time it takes to take care of each dog:

\[ 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the hours he spends on one dog in a day by 7 to find out how many hours he spends in a week:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs. The correct answer is 35 hours."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's say the number of silver coins is \( S \). Then the number of gold coins would be \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is the sum of silver and gold coins, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Now, divide by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we add 30 to the number of silver coins to find the number of gold coins:
\[ 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The final answer is:
\[ 70 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we first find half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. Then we add 5 to this number to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final answer is 23."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the first 20 minutes, he scores 4 points. In the next 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.

First, we know he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% more than 4 points.

25% of 4 points is:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point} \]

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points} \]

Now, to find the total points he scored, we add the points from both 20-minute segments:
\[ 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Mike scored is 9."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Terry eats 2 yogurts every day. If yogurts are sold in packs of 4 for $5.00, we need to find out how many packs Terry will buy in 30 days and then calculate the total cost.

First, let's see how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
\[ 2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts} \]

Now, since yogurts are sold in packs of 4, we need to find out how many packs of 4 are in 60 yogurts:
\[ \frac{60 \, \text{yogurts}}{4 \, \text{yogurts/pack}} = 15 \, \text{packs} \]

Each pack costs $5.00, so the total cost for 15 packs is:
\[ 15 \, \text{packs} \times 5 \, \text{\$/pack} = 75 \, \text{\$} \]

So, Terry spends $75 on yogurt over 30 days. The correct answer is \(\boxed{75}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John sells each of his 13 lego sets for $15. So, the total money he gets from selling the lego sets is:
\[ 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John buys 8 video games, each costing $20. So, the total cost for the video games is:
\[ 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the video games, John has $5 left. So, the money he has left after buying the video games is:
\[ 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

But we know he actually has $5 left, so the $35 he has left is the money he had initially, which is the total amount he made from selling his lego sets.

Since he started with 13 lego sets and sold all of them, he still has:
\[ 13 - 13 = 0 \text{ lego sets} \]

So, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John runs a total of 60 miles in a week. He runs for 3 days, and on the first day, he runs for 3 hours. The other two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is 1.5 hours each day.

So, the total time he runs in a week is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how fast he runs, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

So, John's running speed is 10 miles per hour. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. We also know that skipping speed is half of her running speed. So, if she skips at 3 miles per hour, her running speed must be twice that, which is 6 miles per hour.

Next, we need to figure out how much time she spends running and walking. She spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is 6 hours, we can calculate the time spent on each activity:
- Time spent running = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \) hours
- Time spent walking = \( \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \) hours

Now, let's calculate the distance she covers by running and walking:
- Distance running = Running speed × Time spent running = 6 miles/hour × 2 hours = 12 miles
- Walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, so it's \( \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \) miles per hour. Distance walking = Walking speed × Time spent walking = 1.5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 6 miles

So, the total distance she can travel in 6 hours is the sum of the distances she covers by running and walking:
- Total distance = Distance running + Distance walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles

Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 18 miles. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old. Ben's iPhone is twice as old as Suzy's, so Ben's iPhone is 2 years old. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's, so Brandon's iPhone is 4 times 2, which is 8 years old.

So, Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old. The answer is:

\[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, we calculate:

\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:

\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

So, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it with the javelin.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"

Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

After the guests had their pieces, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces the guests took, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces:

\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces remaining} = 26 \text{ pieces taken} \]

So, the number of pieces taken by the guests is 26.

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that each serving of chips has 50 calories because the total calories in the bag (250 calories) divided by the number of servings (5) gives us 50 calories per serving.

Next, you've already consumed 1800 calories. To find out how many more calories you can consume, we subtract the calories you've already eaten from your daily target:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many servings of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. Since each serving has 50 calories, we divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Each serving is 50 grams, so to find out how many grams you can eat, we multiply the number of servings by the grams per serving:

\[ 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

So, you can eat 200 grams of chips. The correct answer is:

\[ 200 \text{ grams} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Charlie can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax. To make 20 candles, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost for 2 pounds of beeswax and the wicks is $20.00.

If he sells each candle for $2.00, then for 20 candles, he would make:
\[ 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the net profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue:
\[ 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is $20.00.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. So, we need to find out how many more articles that is. 

First, we calculate 2/5 of 5 articles:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \]

So, on Tuesday, she wrote 2 more articles than on Monday, which means she wrote:
\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles} \]

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles} \]

Now, we add up all the articles she wrote over the three days:
\[ 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles} \]

Each article takes 4 hours to write. So, the total time spent writing is:
\[ 26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 104 hours. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Candice started with 80 Post-it notes. She used some of them to put on coffee cups and had 23 left. We know she put one on each of 220 cups, so she used 220 Post-it notes. Now, to find out how many she bought at the store, we need to add the 220 she used to the 23 she had left, and then subtract that from the 80 she started with.

So, we do:
\[ 80 - 220 + 23 = 23 \]
But we need to find out how many she bought, so we rearrange it:
\[ 80 - 23 = 57 \]
Then we add the 220 she used:
\[ 57 + 220 = 277 \]

But wait, we need to find out how many she bought, not how many she had after using some. So, we need to subtract the 23 she had left from the total she started with:
\[ 80 - 23 = 57 \]

So, she bought 57 Post-it notes. But the options given are 163, 140, 220, and 23. The correct number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased is 163.

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we divide the total amount spent by the cost of one blue tie:

\[ \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5 \]

So, John bought 5 blue ties. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought:

\[ \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie. So, the cost of one red tie is:

\[ \text{Cost of one red tie} = 40 + (0.50 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60 \]

Now, to find out how much he spent on the red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of one red tie:

\[ \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \]

Finally, to find out the total amount John spent on ties, we add the cost of the blue ties and the cost of the red ties:

\[ \text{Total spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800 \]

So, the total amount John spent on ties is $800. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have a piece of wire that is 4 feet long. First, we need to convert this length into inches because the pieces are measured in inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the total length in inches as follows:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we need to find out how many 6-inch pieces we can get from 48 inches of wire. We do this by dividing the total length by the length of each piece:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} \div 6 \text{ inches/piece} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire. The final answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out the total number of units in the building. The building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units. So, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

\[ 15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units} \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, we calculate 3/4 of 120 units:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units} \]

Now, to find out how many units are unoccupied, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

\[ 120 \text{ units} - 90 \text{ units} = 30 \text{ units} \]

So, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

First, we know that Lloyd's chickens lay 252 eggs every day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can find out how many dozens of eggs he gets each day by dividing 252 by 12. 

\[ 252 \div 12 = 21 \text{ dozens} \]

Next, we know that Lloyd sells each dozen for $2. So, to find out how much he makes in a day, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.

\[ 21 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ dollars per dozen} = 42 \text{ dollars per day} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week, which is 7.

\[ 42 \text{ dollars per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 294 \text{ dollars per week} \]

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week. The correct answer is \(\boxed{294}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM at 10 miles per hour. That's 3 hours of travel time because 4 PM - 1 PM = 3 hours.

Now, he travels back at 6 miles per hour. We need to find out how long it takes him to travel back the same distance he went out.

The distance he traveled out is 10 miles per hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

Now, to find out how long it takes to travel back 30 miles at 6 miles per hour, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to travel back is:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it takes him 5 hours to get back.

The final answer is:

"Uriah needs to remove 30 comic books, and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound. So, the total weight of the comic books he removes is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

He needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, the remaining weight to be removed is:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of each toy:

\[ \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys} \]

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out which day the mechanic earned more money.

On Thursday:
- The mechanic repaired 6 truck tires, and each tire costs $60. So, the total for truck tires is \(6 \times 60 = 360\) dollars.
- The mechanic also repaired 4 car tires, and each tire costs $40. So, the total for car tires is \(4 \times 40 = 160\) dollars.
- Adding these together, the total revenue on Thursday is \(360 + 160 = 520\) dollars.

On Friday:
- The mechanic repaired 12 car tires, and each tire costs $40. So, the total for car tires is \(12 \times 40 = 480\) dollars.
- The mechanic didn't repair any truck tires, so the total for truck tires is \(0\) dollars.
- Adding these together, the total revenue on Friday is \(0 + 480 = 480\) dollars.

Now, to find out how much more money the mechanic earned on Thursday compared to Friday, we subtract the Friday revenue from the Thursday revenue:
\[ 520 - 480 = 40 \]

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the animal shelter. Now, their mother tells them that their other two cats, Patchy and Trixie, have had kittens too. Patchy had three times as many kittens as the adopted ones, so that's 3 times 7, which is 21 kittens. Trixie had 12 kittens.

So, to find out the total number of kittens, we add the adopted kittens, Patchy's kittens, and Trixie's kittens together:
7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy's) + 12 (Trixie's) = 40 kittens.

Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is 40."

"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many boxes can be added to the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit. Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. **Find the maximum weight the truck can carry:**
   The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The truck and the driver together weigh 3755 pounds. So, the weight the truck can carry for the boxes is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine how many boxes can fit:**
   Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can fit in 1245 pounds, we divide 1245 by 15:
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Stephen ordered groceries that cost $40.00. The delivery person added a 25% fee to the total, which is $40.00. To find out how much that fee is, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00 \]

So, the delivery fee is $10.00. Now, we add this fee to the original $40.00:

\[ 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \]

Then, Stephen added a $4.00 tip. We add this tip to the $50.00:

\[ 50.00 + 4.00 = 54.00 \]

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries is $54.00. 

The correct answer is **$54.00**."

So, the total number of raspberries is 187. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{187} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 25 oranges in total. Out of these, 1 is bad and 2 are sour. So, we can subtract these from the total to find out how many are either good or unripe.

First, let's find out how many oranges are unripe. The problem states that 20% of the oranges are unripe. So, we calculate 20% of 25:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

So, there are 5 unripe oranges. Now, we know there are 1 bad orange and 2 sour oranges. Adding these up:

\[ 1 \text{ (bad)} + 5 \text{ (unripe)} + 2 \text{ (sour)} = 8 \]

Now, we subtract this from the total number of oranges to find out how many are good:

\[ 25 - 8 = 17 \]

So, the number of good oranges is 17. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out the total cost of the brooch before insurance. Janet spends $500 on the material and $800 on the jeweler to make it. So, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

This means the total cost before insurance is $1300.

Next, Janet has to pay 10% of this total cost as insurance. To find 10% of $1300, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 1300 = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

So, the cost of insurance is $130.

Now, to find the total amount Janet paid, we add the cost of the brooch and the insurance cost together:

\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid is $1430.

The final answer is $1430."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Marcy gets a pension of $50,000 per year for the first 20 years of her work. So, for 20 years, she gets:
\[ 20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000 \text{ dollars} \]

After 20 years, she starts getting 5% of her total pension as her pension. The total pension she had after 20 years is $1,000,000. So, 5% of $1,000,000 is:
\[ 0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, for the next 10 years, she gets $50,000 per year from the 21st year to the 30th year. Adding the $50,000 she gets each year for 10 years to the $50,000 she gets each year for the first 20 years, we get:
\[ 50,000 + 50,000 = 100,000 \text{ dollars per year} \]

So, after 30 years, Marcy's annual pension is $100,000. The correct answer is:

"To find out the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break it down into two parts: the first half of the year and the second half of the year.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first half of the year. There are 6 months in the first half, and the service charges $140 per month. So, we multiply $140 by 6:

\[ 140 \times 6 = 840 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, for the second half of the year, the service charges are 10% less than the initial amount. So, we first find 10% of $140:

\[ 0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we subtract this 10% from the initial amount to get the reduced charge for the second half:

\[ 140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we calculate the cost for the second half of the year by multiplying $126 by 6:

\[ 126 \times 6 = 756 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the costs of the first and second halves of the year to find the total amount paid:

\[ 840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $1596. 

The correct answer is: **1596**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sophia's car needs 4 gallons of gas to travel 100 miles. So, we can figure out how many miles she can drive per gallon of gas. If 4 gallons take her 100 miles, then 1 gallon would take her 100 / 4 = 25 miles.

Now, her car's tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. If she can drive 25 miles on 1 gallon, then on 12 gallons, she can drive 25 * 12 = 300 miles.

So, the number of miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas is 300 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV. He then reads for half that time, which is 1 hour. So, in one session, he spends a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/session × 3 sessions/week = 9 hours.

Now, we need to find out how many hours he spends in 4 weeks. So, 9 hours/week × 4 weeks = 36 hours.

Therefore, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 36 hours.

The final answer is: 36 hours."
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Each school sends:
- 5 girls' players
- 5 boys' players
- 1 coach for the girls' team
- 1 coach for the boys' team

So, each school sends a total of:
\[ 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12 \text{ people} \]

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools is:
\[ 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ people} \]

So, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 175 diamonds.
2. The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the diamonds. So, we calculate the rubies as:
   \[
   175 - 35 = 140
   \]
3. The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we calculate the emeralds as:
   \[
   2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, to find the total number of gems, we add the diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:
\[
175 + 140 + 280 = 605
\]

So, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 605. 

The final answer is \(\boxed{605}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We know there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls. So, the number of boys is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

Now, the total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, which is \(120 + 60 = 180\).

We are also told that there are 5 students for every teacher. So, to find out how many teachers there are, we divide the total number of students by 5. That means \(180 \div 5 = 36\).

So, the number of teachers is 36."
"Bailey receives $5 each week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she gets from her allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. To find out how much she started with, we subtract the total allowance from the total amount she has:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60. The correct answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"Okay, let me break it down for you in a simpler way.

Judy teaches 5 dance classes every day on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so she teaches:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 25 \text{ classes} \]

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students she teaches on weekdays is:
\[ 25 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 375 \text{ students} \]

She charges $15.00 per student, so her earnings from the weekdays are:
\[ 375 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$5625.00 \]

On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes, and each class has 15 students, so the total number of students she teaches on Saturday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 120 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from Saturday are:
\[ 120 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$1800.00 \]

Now, to find out her total earnings for the week, we add her earnings from weekdays and Saturday:
\[ \$5625.00 + \$1800.00 = \$7425.00 \]

So, Judy makes \$7425.00 in one week. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7425} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, so we calculate:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

So, the second recipe has 40 instructions. Now, to find out the total number of instructions for both recipes, we add the instructions from both:

\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

Therefore, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total from selling brownies and cheesecakes.

First, let's calculate the money from the brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.

So, the money from brownies is:
\[ 43 \text{ brownies} \times 3 \text{ dollars per brownie} = 129 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the money from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.

So, the money from cheesecakes is:
\[ 23 \text{ slices} \times 4 \text{ dollars per slice} = 92 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the money from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total money Tommy raises:
\[ 129 \text{ dollars} + 92 \text{ dollars} = 221 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Tommy raises is:
\[ \boxed{221} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Shiela bought 5 cell phones, each costing $150. So, the total cost of the cell phones is:
\[ 5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, there's a 2% interest on each cell phone. To find the total interest, we calculate:
\[ 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the interest to the total cost of the cell phones:
\[ 750 + 15 = 765 \text{ dollars} \]

Shiela has to pay this amount over 3 months. So, to find out how much she pays each month, we divide the total amount by 3:
\[ \frac{765}{3} = 255 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Shiela will pay \(\boxed{255}\) dollars each month for 3 months."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Artie has three types of flowers: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He rounds the prices to the nearest dollar because he has no change today. Here are the rounded prices:
- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds to $3.00
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds to $2.00
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds to $2.00

Now, let's calculate how much he makes from each type of flower:
- For marigolds, he sells 12 pots at $3.00 each. So, \(12 \times 3.00 = 36.00\).
- For petunias, he sells 9 pots at $2.00 each. So, \(9 \times 2.00 = 18.00\).
- For begonias, he sells 17 pots at $2.00 each. So, \(17 \times 2.00 = 34.00\).

Now, we add up all the money he makes:
\[36.00 + 18.00 + 34.00 = 88.00\]

So, the total amount Artie will make is $88.00. The correct answer is \(\boxed{88.00}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the top level (level 4) has 16 square feet. Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

So, for the next level down (level 3):
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \text{ square feet} \]

For the level below that (level 2):
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \text{ square feet} \]

And for the bottom level (level 1):
\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \text{ square feet} \]

Now we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2 square feet
- Level 2: 4 square feet
- Level 3: 8 square feet
- Level 4: 16 square feet

To find the average, we add these square feet together and divide by the number of levels:
\[ 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of levels} = 4 \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

So, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.5} \]"
"To figure out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food she will need and then see how many 110-cup bags that is.

First, let's calculate the dog food needed for the first 180 days:
- The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food per day for 180 days.
- So, the total for the first 180 days is \(1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups}\).

Next, we need to calculate the dog food needed for the rest of the year. There are 365 days in a year, so after the first 180 days, there are \(365 - 180 = 185 \, \text{days}\).
- For the remaining 185 days, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food per day.
- So, the total for the remaining 185 days is \(2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups}\).

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total dog food needed for the year:
- Total dog food needed = \(180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups}\).

Each bag of dog food contains 110 cups. To find out how many bags Cecilia will need, we divide the total cups by the cups per bag:
- Number of bags needed = \(550 \, \text{cups} \div 110 \, \text{cups/bag} = 5 \, \text{bags}\).

So, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year. The answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, to find out how much laundry David does, we divide 400 by 4:

\[ 400 \div 4 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

Next, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond does. The problem says Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. So, we take half of 400:

\[ 400 \div 2 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount David does from the amount Raymond does:

\[ 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds. 

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"To figure out how much Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in different ways.

First, let's look at buying 18 flowers in packages of 3. Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50. To get 18 flowers, we need:
\[ \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ packages} \]
So, the total cost is:
\[ 6 \times 2.50 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's look at buying 18 flowers in packages of 2. Each package of 2 flowers costs $1. To get 18 flowers, we need:
\[ \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ packages} \]
So, the total cost is:
\[ 9 \times 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2: $9.00

Vincent saves more money by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2. The amount saved is:
\[ 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Vincent saves \(\boxed{6.00}\) dollars."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

John needs to pay $100 for grooming his new dog. The groomer offers a 30% discount for new customers. To find out how much John has to pay after the discount, we first need to calculate 30% of $100.

30% of $100 is calculated as:
\[ 100 \times \frac{30}{100} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

So, the discount amount is $30. Now, we subtract this discount from the original cost:
\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, after the discount, John has to pay $70 for grooming his dog.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We start with 24 liters of water.
2. Two girls each get 1/6 of the 24 liters. So, each girl gets:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]
   Since there are two girls, they together get:
   \[
   4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
   \]
3. Then, a boy gets 6 liters of water.
4. Now, we add the water the girls and the boy got together:
   \[
   8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
   \]
5. To find out how much water is left, we subtract the total water taken from the initial amount:
   \[
   24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
   \]

So, the amount of water left is 10 liters. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Charlie starts with 10 stickers. Then he buys 21 more stickers and gets 23 more for his birthday. So, we add these up:

\[ 10 + 21 + 23 = 54 \]

Charlie then gives 9 stickers to his sister. So, we subtract those 9 stickers:

\[ 54 - 9 = 45 \]

Next, Charlie uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. So, we subtract those 28 stickers:

\[ 45 - 28 = 17 \]

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Grace weighs 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. First, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract 2 pounds from 500 to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

To find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{623} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each bush has 25 roses. So, the total number of roses is:
\[ 3 \text{ bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses} \]

Each rose has 8 thorns. So, the total number of thorns is:
\[ 75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns} \]

So, the total number of thorns is 600."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the team played 22 games in total. Let's say they lost \( L \) games. According to the problem, they won 8 more games than they lost, so they won \( L + 8 \) games.

The total number of games played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost:
\[ L + (L + 8) = 22 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

So, they lost 7 games. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, we add 8 to the number of games they lost:
\[ 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games. The correct answer is 15."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Gene goes on 4 vacations each year. He started vacationing when he was 23 years old and is now 34 years old. To find out how many vacations he has been on, we subtract his starting age from his current age and then divide by the number of vacations he takes each year.

So, \(34 - 23 = 11\) years. Since he goes on 4 vacations each year, we divide 11 by 4. But since each vacation is a separate quilt block, we just need to know how many vacations he has had, which is 11.

Therefore, Gene has 11 quilt blocks in total.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

The alarm rang 4 times the first time it went off.
The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, so that's \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, so that's \(12 \div 2 = 6\) times.

Now, we add them all up:
\[4 + 12 + 6 = 22\]

So, the alarm rang a total of 22 times. The correct answer is \(\boxed{22}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Sylvie gets a monthly salary of $600. The company gives a 10% raise every year for the first 5 years if you stay that long. Sylvie just finished her 5th year, so she gets a raise.

1. First, we calculate the raise:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]
   So, her new salary after the first year is:
   \[
   \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]

2. Next year, she gets another 10% raise on her new salary:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66
   \]
   So, her new salary after the second year is:
   \[
   \$660 + \$66 = \$726
   \]

3. The year after that, she gets another 10% raise on her new salary:
   \[
   10\% \text{ of } \$726 = 0.10 \times 726 = \$72.60
   \]
   So, her new salary after the third year is:
   \[
   \$726 + \$72.60 = \$798.60
   \]

So, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary is $798.60. 

If I had to choose from the given options, the closest one would be $798.60. 

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{798.60}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. So if Harald sold \( H \) copies, Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies. Together, they sold 88,000 copies.

So we can write the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The final answer is:
\[ 8000 \]"
"Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. So, the number of guests who will come is:

"To figure out how much potato salad Ted needs, we need to calculate the total amount for both the adults and the children.

First, let's look at the adults:
- Each adult eats 10 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 20 adults.

So, the total potato salad for the adults is:
\[ 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, let's look at the children:
- Each child eats half as much as an adult, so each child eats 5 pounds of potato salad.
- There are 5 children.

So, the total potato salad for the children is:
\[ 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we add the potato salad needed for the adults and the children together:
\[ 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs} \]

So, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The correct answer is 225 pounds."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Cindy has 4 pets.
2. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, so Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
3. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Now, to find the total number of pets, we add up the pets each person has:
\[4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28\]

So, the total number of pets the three have is 28. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler terms.

We know James is 10 years old and he is 1 year younger than Corey. So, Corey must be 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. Let's say Jackson is \( J \) years old. So, Amy is \( J + 5 \) years old.

Amy is also 2 years younger than Corey. Since Corey is 11 years old, Amy must be 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Now we know Amy is 9 years old and she is 5 years older than Jackson. So, if Amy is \( J + 5 \), then \( J + 5 = 9 \). Solving for \( J \), we get \( J = 9 - 5 = 4 \).

So, Jackson is 4 years old. The answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
2. Lee used to be able to run it 2 seconds faster than Gerald, so Gerald's original time was 40 seconds.
3. Lee's speed is calculated by dividing the distance by the time: \( \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second} \).
4. Gerald's original speed is \( \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ meters/second} \).
5. With a 10% improvement, Gerald's new speed is \( 10 \text{ meters/second} + 0.10 \times 10 \text{ meters/second} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \).
6. To find out how fast Gerald can run now, we use the new speed to calculate the time: \( \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds} \).

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 36.36 seconds.

The closest option to 36.36 seconds is 36.36 seconds itself, but if we look at the options provided, it would be:

A) 36.36 seconds

This is the final answer."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 60 dogs in the neighborhood. The number of cats is twice the number of dogs, so we calculate the number of cats as follows:
\[ \text{Number of cats} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we need to find out how many rabbits there are. The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, we add the number of dogs and cats together and then subtract 12:
\[ \text{Number of rabbits} = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 \]

Now, to find the total number of pets, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

So, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{348} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

We have 200 Grade 5 students. If 2/5 of them are boys, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
\[ \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

So, the number of girls is:
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, the number of girls in the girl scout is:
\[ \text{Number of girls in the girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[ \text{Number of girls not in the girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

So, the number of girls who are not in the girl scout is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we start by noting that Harry slept 9 hours. James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept. So, we calculate how many hours James slept:

\[

\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Freda's tomato sauce made 32 ounces, and this is after the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked. So, before cooking, the tomatoes must have been twice that amount, which is 64 ounces.

Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces, and each can contains 3 tomatoes. To find out how many cans she used, we divide the total volume of tomatoes by the volume of one can:

\[ \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans} \]

Since each can has 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes:

\[ \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} \]

So, Freda used 12 tomatoes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We start with 30 cars on the motorway. In the first 15 minutes, some cars drive through the traffic jam. Then, in the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through. After that, 5 cars take an exit.

So, if we let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes, we can write the equation for the remaining cars as follows:

\[ \text{Remaining cars} = 30 - x - 20 - 5 \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ \text{Remaining cars} = 30 - x - 25 \]
\[ \text{Remaining cars} = 5 - x \]

Since the remaining cars are the ones that didn't drive through the traffic jam, and we know the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is \( x + 20 \), and the remaining cars are 5, we can set up the equation:
\[ 5 = 30 - (x + 20) \]

Simplifying the right side:
\[ 5 = 30 - x - 20 \]
\[ 5 = 10 - x \]

Now, solving for \( x \):
\[ x = 10 - 5 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

So, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 5.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she has:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Then, she gets 18 more plants from the nursery, so she now has:
\[ 80 + 18 = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family, so she will give away:
\[ 1 \times 40 = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the plants she gives away from the total she has:
\[ 98 - 40 = 58 \text{ plants} \]

So, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We have four friends, and we need to find out how many times the doorbell was pressed in total.

1. The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend pressed it 1/4 more times than the first friend. So, we calculate:
   \[
   20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
3. The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, so:
   \[
   60 + 10 = 70
   \]

Now, we add up all the times the doorbell was pressed:
\[
20 + 25 + 60 + 70 = 175
\]

So, the total number of doorbell rings is 175. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{175}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Solo needs to read:
- 4 pages from Science
- 20 pages from Social Studies
- 7 pages from History
- 8 pages from Geography

First, we add up all these pages:
\[ 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 \text{ pages} \]

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. So, the number of pages he still needs to read is:
\[ 39 - 15 = 24 \text{ pages} \]

Solo has 4 more days to finish his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ days}} = 6 \text{ pages per day} \]

So, Solo needs to read 6 pages on average each day for the remaining 4 days. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John drinks 4 glasses of water every day for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and before bed. That's 4 glasses a day.

There are 5 weekdays in a week, so:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

On weekends, John drinks only 1 glass of water with dinner. There are 2 weekend days, so:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, let's add the glasses from weekdays and weekends together:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

So, John drinks 22 glasses of water in a week. The correct answer is 22."
"To figure out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile. We do this by dividing 10 minutes by 3 miles:

\[ \text{Time to cover 1 mile} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cover the whole city, which is 42 miles. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to cover 1 mile by 42 miles:

\[ \text{Total time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile} \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:

\[ \text{Total time} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 14 \times 10 = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take the fog bank 140 minutes to cover the whole city. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{140}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. Poppy starts with a 1000-piece puzzle.
2. She places a quarter of the pieces on the board. A quarter of 1000 is 250 pieces. So, she places 250 pieces and has 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces left.
3. Her mom then places a third of the remaining pieces. A third of 750 is 250 pieces. So, her mom places 250 pieces and has 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left.

Therefore, the number of pieces left to be placed is 500. The correct answer is:

\[

"Okay, let me explain this clearly. If Amir eats 5 cookies, and Cody eats three times as many as Amir, then Cody eats \(3 \times 5 = 15\) cookies. So, the total number of cookies they eat together is \(5 + 15 = 20\).

So, the total number of cookies both of them eat together is 20. 

The answer is 20."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 3 boxes, and each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. But the walls are 1 inch thick, so we need to find the inner dimensions of one box first.

1. **Finding the inner dimensions:**
   - The length of the box is 5 inches, but since there's a 1-inch thick wall on each side, the inner length is \(5 - 2 \times 1 = 3\) inches.
   - The width of the box is 6 inches, so the inner width is \(6 - 2 \times 1 = 4\) inches.
   - The height of the box is 4 inches, so the inner height is \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\) inches.

2. **Calculating the volume of one inner box:**
   - The volume of a box is found by multiplying the length, width, and height.
   - So, the volume of one inner box is \(3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24\) cubic inches.

3. **Finding the total volume of all 3 boxes:**
   - Since we have 3 boxes, the total volume is \(3 \times 24 = 72\) cubic inches.

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches. The correct answer is \(\boxed{72}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each night, so that's 2 hours in total.
On Thursday, he watched 1 hour for a 1-hour episode and 30 minutes for a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours.
On Friday, he watched 2 hours.

Now, we know the total time he watched TV is 7 hours. So, let's see how much time he watched on Wednesday:
\[ 7 \text{ hours (total)} - 2 \text{ hours (Monday and Tuesday)} - 1.5 \text{ hours (Thursday)} - 2 \text{ hours (Friday)} = 1.5 \text{ hours} \]

Since 1.5 hours is the same as 1 hour and 30 minutes, and he watched a 1-hour episode on Thursday, the remaining 30 minutes must have been a 30-minute episode on Wednesday.

So, the number of 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. Let's say he baked \( x \) cookies last year. So, this year he wanted to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

But he ended up baking 15 more than he intended, so he actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.

After that, he dropped 5 cookies, so he had \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies left.

We know that after dropping 5 cookies, he had 110 cookies left. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]
\[ x = \frac{100}{2} \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year. The answer is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The gas station sells gas for $3.00 per gallon. If you buy 10 gallons, the total cost without any cashback would be:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00 \]

The app company gives $0.20 cashback for every gallon you buy. So, for 10 gallons, the total cashback would be:
\[ 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00 \]

Now, to find out the total cost after the cashback, we subtract the cashback from the total cost:
\[ \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00 \]

So, the final cost after the cashback is $28.00."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice, her fruit roll-up is 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups she ate is:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

For Marcell, his fruit roll-up is 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. So, the total number of fruit roll-ups he ate is:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Now, we add the total number of fruit roll-ups they both ate:
\[ 48 + 42 = 90 \]

To find the average, we divide the total number of fruit roll-ups by 2:
\[ \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate is 45. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how fast Julia rows the boat. It takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. So, her speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes her to row 64 seconds to the shore. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate the time it takes to row 64 feet:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 feet} = \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{20 \text{ feet/16 seconds}} = \frac{64}{20} \times 16 = 3.2 \times 16 = 51.2 \text{ seconds} \]

But the problem states that it takes her 64 seconds to row to the shore, so we use 64 seconds directly.

Now, we know the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed. So, for 64 feet, the amount of water taken on is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{64 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 6.4 \times 2 = 12.8 \text{ liters} \]

So, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

- There are 4 teachers.
- Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
- So, the total number of lessons in a day is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) lessons.
- Each lesson, the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times.

To find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we multiply the total number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:
\[ 8 \text{ lessons} \times 3 \text{ cleanings per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings} \]

So, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{24}

If 5 of these flowers did not grow, then the number of flowers that actually grew is:

\[ 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 25 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs. The problem tells us that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, if we let \( B \) be the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, we can write:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]

To find \( B \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Now, we know that the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (which is 300) is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph. So, if we let \( D \) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we can write:
\[ 300 = 50D \]

To find \( D \), we divide both sides by 50:
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

So, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 6. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Sasha has leftover lumber that she wants to sell. She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each, and 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $16 each.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 10 boards, and each costs $10.
- So, the total cost for these boards is \(10 \times 10 = \$100\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has 5 boards, and each costs $16.
- So, the total cost for these boards is \(5 \times 16 = \$80\).

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the leftover lumber:
- Total cost = cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards + cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards
- Total cost = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Since Sasha is selling all the leftover lumber and assuming the selling price is the same as the cost price, the total revenue from selling all the lumber is also \$180.

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
- Profit = total revenue - total cost
- Profit = \$180 - \$180 = \$0.

So, Sasha makes a profit of \$0. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many teaspoons of sugar Katy used, given the ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13 and the total amount used is 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water.

First, let's understand the ratio. For every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. So, the total parts of the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

If the total amount used is 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, we can divide 120 by 20 to find out how many parts each unit represents. So, 120 ÷ 20 = 6. This means each part of the ratio represents 6 units.

Since the number of teaspoons of sugar is 7 parts of the ratio, we multiply 7 by 6 to find the number of teaspoons of sugar:
7 × 6 = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoons of sugar. The correct answer is 42."
"John has 3 children, and he buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child. So, he buys \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pairs of shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $60, so the total cost is \(6 \times 60 = 360\).

The total amount John paid is $360. 

If we had to choose from the following options:
A) $120
B) $240
C) $360
D) $480

The correct answer would be C) $360."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Initially, the customs officer counted 2 containers, and each container had 5 vehicles. So, the total number of vehicles initially was:
\[ 2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles} \]

On the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30. So, the number of vehicles that were added on the second day is:
\[ 30 \text{ vehicles} - 10 \text{ vehicles} = 20 \text{ vehicles} \]

Since each container has 5 vehicles, the number of containers that were added on the second day is:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers} \]

So, the number of containers imported on the second day is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Adrien's initial salary was $40,000. Four years later, his salary increased by 40%. So, we need to calculate 40% of $40,000 and add it to the original amount.

First, let's find 40% of $40,000:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 40,000 = 0.40 \times 40,000 = 16,000 \]

Now, add this to the original salary:
\[ 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 \]

So, Adrien's salary four years later is $56,000.

Next, we need to find Lylah's salary four years ago. We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, if Lylah's salary was \( L \), then:
\[ 40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]
\[ L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} \approx 30,769.23 \]

Four years later, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. So, we calculate 40% of $30,769.23:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 30,769.23 = 0.40 \times 30,769.23 = 12,307.69 \]

Now, add this to the original salary:
\[ 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 = 43,076.92 \]

So, Lylah's salary four years later is $43,076.92.

Finally, to find the total salary the two were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries:
\[ 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad has 30 sheets. So, the number of sheets he uses in one week is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how many sheets he uses in a month. If we assume a month has about 4 weeks, then the number of sheets he uses in a month is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

So, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is 240. 

The correct answer is 240."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges. So, she brought a total of:

Kael brought twice the number of apples Morisette brought, which is:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ apples} \]

Kael also brought half the number of oranges Morisette brought, which is:
\[ \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ oranges} \]

So, Kael brought a total of:
\[ 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ fruits} \]

Now, to find out the total number of fruits they brought together, we add Morisette's and Kael's fruits:
\[ 13 + 14 = 27 \text{ fruits} \]

So, the total number of fruits they have is:
\[

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, let's break it down day by day.

- On Monday, she slept 8 hours.
- On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
- On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
- On Thursday and Friday, she slept 1 hour more than the total she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. The total for Tuesday and Wednesday is \(6 + 4 = 10\) hours. So, on Thursday and Friday, she slept \(10 + 1 = 11\) hours each day.

Now, let's add up all the hours:
- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 6 hours
- Wednesday: 4 hours
- Thursday: 11 hours
- Friday: 11 hours

Adding these together:
\[8 + 6 + 4 + 11 + 11 = 40\]

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. To find out how far she runs in those 3 hours, we multiply her speed by the time:

\[ 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Rosie runs 30 miles in the first 3 hours.

Next, she runs at 5 miles per hour for the remaining time. Since she has a total of 7 hours and she already used 3 hours, she has:

\[ 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, we calculate how far she runs in those 4 hours at 5 miles per hour:

\[ 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

To find the total distance Rosie runs in 7 hours, we add the distances from both parts of her run:

\[ 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"

Jennie has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps. She stamps one-third of these letters. So, she stamps:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ letters} \]

After stamping these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters that are already stamped. This means that before she started stamping, there were:
\[ 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ letters} \]

So, the number of letters that were already stamped when Jennie began is 10. The answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Julia originally had some spoons, and her husband gave her 5 more. She used 3 spoons to taste her stew. After all this, she had 12 spoons left.

So, if we add the spoons her husband gave her to the spoons she originally had and then subtract the spoons she used, we get the total she had left:
\[ \text{Original spoons} + 5 - 3 = 12 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{Original spoons} + 2 = 12 \]

To find out how many spoons she originally had, we subtract 2 from 12:
\[ \text{Original spoons} = 12 - 2 \]
\[ \text{Original spoons} = 10 \]

So, Julia originally bought 10 spoons. The answer is 10."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. He also bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, so he bought 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

To find out the total number of sausages, we add the chicken sausages and the fish sausages together:
38 (chicken sausages) + 44 (fish sausages) = 82 sausages in total.

So, Dylan bought 82 sausages in all. The final answer is 82."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Lily made 50 friends. Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, so Amy made \(50 + 20 = 70\) friends.

Now, to find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we add the number of friends each of them has. So, \(50 + 70 = 120\).

Therefore, the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together is 120.

The final numerical answer is 120."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Dillon will spend.

First, we know that each pepper costs $15. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, we can calculate the cost of a watermelon as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, an orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so:
\[ \text{Cost of an orange} = \text{Cost of a watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to calculate how much Dillon will spend on each type of fruit:
- For the watermelons: Dillon buys 4 watermelons, so:
\[ \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

- For the peppers: Dillon buys 20 peppers, so:
\[ \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

- For the oranges: Dillon buys 10 oranges, so:
\[ \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total amount Dillon will spend:
\[ \text{Total amount} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is:
\[ \boxed{880} \]"

First, we need to figure out how many hours of doctor time are used each day. Each patient is seen for 24 minutes, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. So, each patient is seen for \( \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \) hours.

The hospital sees 500 people a day, so the total hours of doctor time used each day is \( 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \) hours.

Next, we need to calculate the money the hospital gets from the patients. The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients, so for 200 hours, the hospital gets \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) dollars.

Now, we need to calculate how much the hospital spends on the doctors. The doctors charge $150 per hour, so for 200 hours, the hospital spends \( 200 \times 150 = 30,000 \) dollars.

To find the profit, we subtract the cost from the revenue: \( 40,000 - 30,000 = 10,000 \) dollars.

So, the hospital makes a profit of \( \boxed{10000} \) dollars from these visits."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Nissa hires 60 elves to play in her Santa village.

1. A third of the elves quit because children vomit on them. So, we calculate a third of 60:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   This means 20 elves quit. So, the number of elves left is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]

2. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit because kids kicked their shins. So, we subtract 10 from the 40 elves that are left:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

So, the number of elves left is 30. The final answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

In May, Joseph spent $500. In June, he spent $60 less than that, so he spent $500 - $60 = $440.

To find out how much he spent in total for May and June, we add the amounts together: $500 + $440 = $940.

So, the total expenditure for those two months is $940."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times, and each ride costs 6 tickets. So, for the roller coaster, she used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets. Then, she rode the luge 2 times, and each luge ride also costs 6 tickets, so she used another \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets. In total, Pam used \(12 + 12 = 24\) tickets.

Fred rode the roller coaster 4 times, so he used \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets for the roller coaster. Then, he rode the luge 2 times, so he used \(2 \times 6 = 12\) tickets for the luge. In total, Fred used \(24 + 12 = 36\) tickets.

Now, to find out how many tickets they used together, we add Pam's and Fred's tickets:
\[24 + 36 = 60\]

So, the total number of tickets they used that day is 60. The correct answer is 60."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he did on Monday. So, we calculate:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know the total miles he walked from Monday to Tuesday is:
\[ 4 \text{ miles (Monday)} + 24 \text{ miles (Tuesday)} = 28 \text{ miles} \]

The total miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday from the total miles walked from Monday to Wednesday:
\[ 41 \text{ miles (Monday to Wednesday)} - 28 \text{ miles (Monday to Tuesday)} = 13 \text{ miles} \]

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we can break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many car washes Tom gets in a year. Since he gets 4 car washes each month and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply these numbers together:

\[ 4 \text{ car washes/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ car washes/year} \]

Next, we know that each car wash costs $15. To find out the total cost for the year, we multiply the number of car washes by the cost per car wash:

\[ 48 \text{ car washes/year} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 720 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{720}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Brian originally had 20 video games, but he lost 5, so he has 15 video games now.

The problem says Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian has. So, we first calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has:

\[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

Then, we subtract 5 from 45 to find out how many video games Bobby has:

\[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 27 unicorns in total. One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
\]

Now, we know that two thirds of these Scottish unicorns are female. So, we calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns as:

\[
\text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

So, the number of female Scottish unicorns is 6. 

The correct answer is \boxed{6}."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out the total cost of Rory's delivery order.

First, we calculate the cost of the subs:
\[ 2 \text{ subs} \times \$7.50 \text{ per sub} = 2 \times 7.50 = \$15.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the chips:
\[ 2 \text{ bags of chips} \times \$1.50 \text{ per bag} = 2 \times 1.50 = \$3.00 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the cookies:
\[ 2 \text{ cookies} \times \$1.00 \text{ per cookie} = 2 \times 1.00 = \$2.00 \]

Now, we add up the cost of the subs, chips, and cookies:
\[ \$15.00 + \$3.00 + \$2.00 = \$20.00 \]

Next, we add a 20% delivery fee to the subtotal. First, we calculate 20% of \$20.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 20.00 = 0.20 \times 20.00 = \$4.00 \]

We add the delivery fee to the subtotal:
\[ \$20.00 + \$4.00 = \$24.00 \]

Finally, we add the $5.00 tip to the total:
\[ \$24.00 + \$5.00 = \$29.00 \]

So, the total cost of Rory's delivery order is:
\[ \boxed{29.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many questions Mark completed on each test.

For the first test:
- He had 8 hours to complete it.
- He completes 5 questions every hour.
- So, the number of questions he completed is \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) questions.

For the second test:
- He had 6 hours to complete it.
- He completes 5 questions every hour.
- So, the number of questions he completed is \( 6 \times 5 = 30 \) questions.

Now, we need to find out how many questions he left incomplete on each test.

For the first test:
- The test had 75 questions.
- He completed 40 questions.
- So, the number of questions he left incomplete is \( 75 - 40 = 35 \) questions.

For the second test:
- The test had 100 questions.
- He completed 30 questions.
- So, the number of questions he left incomplete is \( 100 - 30 = 70 \) questions.

To find the total number of questions he left incomplete, we add the incomplete questions from both tests:
\[ 35 + 70 = 105 \]

So, the total number of questions Mark left incomplete is 105. 

The final answer is: \(\boxed{105}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 12 blue gumballs. The problem tells us that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. So, we can write this as:

\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Since we know \( B = 12 \), we can substitute 12 for \( B \):

\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, the number of pink gumballs is 70. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we first need to know how many of them there are. We know there are 20 cars in total, 12 of which are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the rest must be semi-automatic.

Let's calculate the number of semi-automatic cars:
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total number of cars} - (\text{Number of automatic cars} + \text{Number of manual cars}) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - 16 \]
\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 4 \]

Now, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 0.2 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of semi-automatic cars is 20%. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 700 bees in total. The problem tells us there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, and twice as many baby bees as queens. Let's use \( Q \) to represent the number of queens, \( B \) for baby bees, and \( W \) for worker bees.

From the problem:
1. \( W = 2B \) (worker bees are twice as many as baby bees)
2. \( B = 2Q \) (baby bees are twice as many as queens)

We also know:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Substituting \( W = 2B \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 2B + B + Q = 700 \]
\[ 3B + Q = 700 \]

Since \( B = 2Q \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( 2Q \):
\[ 3(2Q) + Q = 700 \]
\[ 6Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

Now, we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \times 200 = 400 \]

So, the number of worker bees is 400.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"Sure, let me explain this in a simpler way.

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day. In one week, which has 7 days, he plays:
\[ 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ hours/week} \]

Now, Jordan earns $10 for every hour he works. So, if he works 14 hours in a week, he would earn:
\[ 14 \text{ hours/week} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 140 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the amount of money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working instead is $140. 

The final answer is: **140**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to add up the cost of all the items before tax:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Adding these up:
\[ 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 15 \]

Now, we need to add the tax to the non-food items. The tax rate is 10%.

- Light bulbs cost $3, so the tax is \( 3 \times 0.10 = 0.30 \) dollars.
- Roach traps cost $4, so the tax is \( 4 \times 0.10 = 0.40 \) dollars.

Adding the tax to the cost of these items:
- Light bulbs including tax: \( 3 + 0.30 = 3.30 \) dollars
- Roach traps including tax: \( 4 + 0.40 = 4.40 \) dollars

Now, we add the cost of the food items (milk, eggs, and cups) to the total:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3
- Cups: $3

Adding these up:
\[ 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \]

Now, we add the total cost of the non-food items including tax to the total cost of the food items:
\[ 8 + 3.30 + 4.40 = 15.70 \]

So, the total cost including tax is:
\[ \boxed{15.70} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, so he will have a total of 8 clients.

Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths. The cost of one bottle of bleach is $2 and the cost of one pack of cloths is $5.

First, let's calculate the total cost for the bleach:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach, so for 8 clients, it's \(8 \times 2 = 16\) bottles.
- The cost for 16 bottles of bleach is \(16 \times 2 = \$32\).

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the cloths:
- Each client needs 1 pack of cloths, so for 8 clients, it's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) packs.
- The cost for 8 packs of cloths is \(8 \times 5 = \$40\).

Now, let's add up the total expenses:
- Total cost for bleach: $32
- Total cost for cloths: $40
- Total expenses: $32 + $40 = $72

Kim's total income each week is $92.

To find the profit, we subtract the total expenses from the total income:
- Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
- Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

So, Kim's profit each week is $20. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John has 10 hectares of pineapple field, and he can harvest pineapples every 3 months. There are 100 pineapples per hectare.

First, we need to find out how many times John can harvest in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year and he harvests every 3 months, we divide 12 by 3:
\[ 12 \div 3 = 4 \]
So, John can harvest 4 times in a year.

Next, we know that in one hectare, he gets 100 pineapples every 3 months. Since he has 10 hectares, we multiply the number of pineapples per hectare by the number of hectares:
\[ 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Now, since he can harvest 4 times in a year, we multiply the number of pineapples he gets in one harvest by the number of harvests in a year:
\[ 1000 \text{ pineapples} \times 4 = 4000 \text{ pineapples} \]

So, the total number of pineapples John can harvest in a year is 4000. The answer is 4000."
"Johnny has three lego sets. The first set has 500 pieces. The second set has 3 times as many pieces as the first set, so it has \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) pieces. The third set has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the first set, so it has \(\frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125\) pieces.

To find out how many pieces Johnny picks up, we add the pieces from all three sets together:
\[500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125\]

So, Johnny picks up a total of 2125 lego pieces. The final answer is 2125."
"Okay, let's go through the problem step by step again to find out how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. In the next 6 hours, half of the 30 bees return, which is 15 bees.
3. In the next 6 hours, twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours, so 60 bees leave.

So, at the end of the first 12 hours, the hive has:
- 30 bees that left but haven't returned yet.
- 15 bees that returned.

The total number of bees in the hive at the end of the first 12 hours is:
\[ 0 - 30 + 15 = -15 \]
This means there are 15 bees that left but haven't returned yet.

In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return to the hive. So, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is:
\[ 30 \text{ bees} \]

Therefore, the number of bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to add the cost of one adult ticket and one child ticket together. The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. So, the total cost for both tickets is:

\[ 12 + 10 = 22 \]

Now, we know that after paying for the tickets, Brittany's mom received $8 in change. This means the total amount of money she gave the cashier is the cost of the tickets plus the change she received:

\[ 22 + 8 = 30 \]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We know Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, and he has three times as many friends as Dorothy. So, if we divide Charlie's friends by 3, we can find out how many friends Dorothy has. 

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, we know James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, we multiply Dorothy's friends by 4 to find out how many friends James has.

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. The correct answer is 16."
"Steve and Tim are racing home from school. Steve lives 3 miles away, and Tim lives 2 miles away. Steve can bike at 440 feet per minute, and Tim can skate at 264 feet per minute. We need to find out how long it will take for the winner to get home before the loser finishes.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet. Since there are 5280 feet in a mile:

- Steve's distance: \(3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet}\)
- Tim's distance: \(2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet}\)

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each to travel their respective distances:

- Time for Steve to bike home: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim to skate home: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

The winner is Steve, who takes 36 minutes to get home. The loser is Tim, who takes 40 minutes to get home. The difference in their travel times is:

\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

So, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final answer is: \(\boxed{4}\)"
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Shawnda charges 25 cents to inflate each tire. We need to find out how much she made by inflating tires for bicycles, tricycles, and a unicycle.

First, let's look at the bicycles:
- Each bicycle has 2 tires.
- 5 people came with bicycles, so that's 5 bicycles.
- Each bicycle tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- So, for one bicycle, it costs \(2 \times 25 = 50\) cents.
- For 5 bicycles, it costs \(5 \times 50 = 250\) cents.

Next, let's look at the tricycles:
- Each tricycle has 3 tires.
- 3 people came with tricycles, so that's 3 tricycles.
- Each tricycle tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- So, for one tricycle, it costs \(3 \times 25 = 75\) cents.
- For 3 tricycles, it costs \(3 \times 75 = 225\) cents.

Finally, let's look at the unicycle:
- A unicycle has 1 tire.
- 1 person came with a unicycle.
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- So, for one unicycle, it costs \(1 \times 25 = 25\) cents.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost for bicycles: 250 cents
- Cost for tricycles: 225 cents
- Cost for the unicycle: 25 cents
- Total cost: \(250 + 225 + 25 = 500\) cents

To convert cents to dollars:
- 500 cents is equal to 5 dollars.

So, Shawnda made 5 dollars that day. The answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Carl buys ten packs of cookies, and each pack has six cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies per pack} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Each cookie costs $0.10, so the total cost for all the cookies is:

\[ 60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00 \]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he gets, we subtract the total cost from the $10 bill:

\[ \$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00 \]

So, the change Carl receives is:

\[
\boxed{4.00}

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. After the seagull, the remaining fries are \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
5. After the pigeons, the remaining fries are \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
6. A raccoon ate two thirds of the remaining fries, so it ate \( \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) \) fries.
7. After the raccoon, the remaining fries are \( x - 30 - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \).
8. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving 5 fries behind. So, we have:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
9. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5 \implies \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6 \implies x - 30 = 18 \implies x = 48
   \]

So, the initial number of french fries in the pack was 48. 

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how many hours Kimo spends on classes in one semester.

First, we look at the days he has classes:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has 3 classes each day, and each class is 1 hour long. So, each of these days he spends \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours on classes.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), in one week he spends \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours on these days.
- Over 16 weeks, he spends \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours on these days.

Next, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes each day, and each class is 2 hours long. So, each of these days he spends \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours on classes.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), in one week he spends \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours on these days.
- Over 16 weeks, he spends \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours on these days.

Now, we add the hours from both types of days:
- Total hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday days: 144 hours
- Total hours on Tuesday and Thursday days: 128 hours
- Total hours in one semester: \(144 + 128 = 272\) hours

So, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. We need to find out the total length of all these baked goods put end to end in feet.

First, let's calculate the total length of each type of baked good in inches:

1. **Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Total length of rolls = \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches.

2. **Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Total length of croissants = \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches.

3. **Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of baguettes = \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) inches.

Now, let's add up the total length of all the baked goods in inches:
- Total length = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes
- Total length = \(1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360\) inches.

Next, we need to convert the total length from inches to feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:
- Total length in feet = \(\frac{3360}{12} = 280\) feet.

So, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is 280 feet. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{280}
\]"
"To figure out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order, we need to add up the bananas each type of ape eats over 2 months.

First, let's look at the monkeys:
- Monkeys need 200 bananas every month.
- For 2 months, the monkeys need \(200 \times 2 = 400\) bananas.

Next, let's look at the gorillas:
- Gorillas need 400 bananas every month.
- For 2 months, the gorillas need \(400 \times 2 = 800\) bananas.

Then, let's look at the baboons:
- Baboons need 100 bananas every month.
- For 2 months, the baboons need \(100 \times 2 = 200\) bananas.

Now, we add up all the bananas needed:
- Monkeys: 400 bananas
- Gorillas: 800 bananas
- Baboons: 200 bananas

So, the total number of bananas needed is \(400 + 800 + 200 = 1400\) bananas.

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). So, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we compare the distances:
- Blake runs 3000 yards.
- Kelly runs 2720 yards.

The difference in the distance run is:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

So, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly). The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Raphael bought 4 pens, each costing $1.5. So, the total cost for the pens is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \]

He also bought 2 notebooks, each costing $4. So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Lastly, he bought a rim of bond paper for $20.

Now, we add up all these costs:
\[ 6 + 8 + 20 = 34 \]

So, Raphael spent a total of $34. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond. Then, 6 of them come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles increases to 11 + 6 = 17. After that, 2 of them hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles decreases by 2, making it 17 - 2 = 15. 

So, the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now is 15. 

The options are:
A) 11
B) 15
C) 17
D) 21

The correct answer is B) 15."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

On Monday, the tank had 17 feet of water. On Tuesday, it had 7 feet more than Monday, so we add 7 feet to 17 feet:

\[ 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet} \]

So, on Tuesday, the tank had 24 feet of water. Now, on Wednesday, the water depth is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find out how much water there is on Wednesday, we take two-thirds of 24 feet:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet} \]

So, the water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Anakin caught:
- 10 starfish
- 6 sea horses
- 3 clownfish

Locsin caught:
- 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish
- 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses
- 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish

Now, let's add up all the fish they caught:

- Starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives us the total number of fish:
\[15 + 9 + 8 = 32\]

So, the total number of fish they caught is 32."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We start with a bag of marbles that costs $20. Every two months, the price goes up by 20% of the original price. We need to find out how much it will cost after 36 months.

First, let's see how much the price goes up every two months:
- 20% of $20 is $4.
So, every two months, the price increases by $4.

Now, we need to find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months:
- 36 months divided by 2 months per period gives us 18 periods.

Since the price goes up by $4 every two months, over 18 periods, the total increase will be:
- 18 periods times $4 per period equals $72.

So, the new price after 36 months will be the original price plus the total increase:
- $20 plus $72 equals $92.

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $92. The correct answer is \(\boxed{92}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know:
- There are 5 red cars, and each costs $4.
- There are 3 action figures, and each costs $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, which means it costs $15 (since each action figure costs $5).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of toy:
- The total cost for the red cars is \(5 \times 4 = 20\) dollars.
- The total cost for the action figures is \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.
- The doll costs $15.

Adding these together gives us the total cost of all the toys:
\[20 + 15 + 15 = 50\]

So, the total value of all the toys is $50. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{50}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jackie can do 3 fewer hours of freelance work if she does her taxes herself. She earns $35 per hour from freelance work. So, if she does her taxes herself, she loses:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

The accountant charges $90 to do the taxes. To find out how much more money she would have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the missed income:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

So, Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{-15} \]"
"Elvira has a budget of €1500 for her birthday gift. She bought a computer with accessories that cost her €1090, plus she got a scanner for €157, a CD burner for €74, and a printer for €102. Let's add up all these costs to see how much she spent.

First, let's add the cost of the computer and accessories:
- Computer: €1090
- Scanner: €157
- CD burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add these amounts together:
€1090 + €157 + €74 + €102 = €1423

Elvira's total budget is €1500. To find out how much money she has left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:
€1500 - €1423 = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing. The correct answer is:
**€77**"
"To figure out how many times Sandra needs to babysit, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know that to make one Spanish flan, Sandra needs 3 eggs. If she wants to make 15 flans, we calculate the total number of eggs needed:
\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we know that each time Sandra babysits, she gets 9 eggs. To find out how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting:
\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

So, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to have enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Seth is twice as old as Brooke. So if Brooke is \( B \) years old, Seth is \( 2B \) years old.

In two years, Brooke will be \( B + 2 \) years old and Seth will be \( 2B + 2 \) years old. The problem says that in two years, their combined age will be 28. So we can write the equation:

\[ (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \]

Simplify the left side:

\[ B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:

\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ B = 8 \]

So Brooke is 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke:

\[ S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16 years old. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain this clearly. We know Ethel has $8. The problem tells us that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. So, we first find out twice the amount Ethel has, which is \(2 \times 8 = 16\). Then we add $2 to that amount to find out how much Jimmy has. So, \(16 + 2 = 18\).

Therefore, Jimmy has $18. The correct answer is 18."
"To find out how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to add up the miles he walks on weekdays and the miles he walks on weekends.

First, let's calculate the miles he walks on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, and he walks 20 miles each day on weekdays.
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 20 \text{ miles/day} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the miles he walks on weekends. There are 2 days in the weekend, and he walks 10 miles each day on weekends.
\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ miles/day} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we add the miles from weekdays and weekends to find the total miles he walks in a week.
\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

So, Pancho walks a total of 120 miles in a week. The correct answer is 120 miles."
"To find out the total cost of each uniform, we need to add up the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants.

First, we know the hat costs $25.

Next, the jacket costs three times as much as the hat. So, we calculate:
\[
\text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
\]

Then, the pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. To find the average, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket and then divide by 2:
\[
\text{Average cost} = \frac{\$25 + \$75}{2} = \frac{\$100}{2} = \$50
\]

So, the pants cost $50.

Now, we add up the costs of the hat, the jacket, and the pants to get the total cost of each uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \$25 + \$75 + \$50 = \$150
\]

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150."
"Jake sees different types of creatures in the Museum of Entomology, and we need to calculate the total number of legs he sees.

First, let's calculate the legs from the spiders:
- There are 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs.
- So, the total legs from spiders are \(80 \times 8 = 640\) legs.

Next, let's calculate the legs from the insects:
- There are 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs.
- So, the total legs from insects are \(90 \times 6 = 540\) legs.

Then, let's calculate the legs from the rare mutant invertebrates:
- There are 3 rare mutant invertebrates, and each one has 10 legs.
- So, the total legs from rare mutant invertebrates are \(3 \times 10 = 30\) legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
- Legs from spiders: 640
- Legs from insects: 540
- Legs from rare mutant invertebrates: 30

Adding these together gives us:
\[640 + 540 + 30 = 1210\]

So, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1210. The correct answer is \(\boxed{1210}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now, we need to find the total age of the four birds. Since the problem doesn't specify the age of the Caboose, we'll assume it's the same as Sally Thirtytwo and Sally Four, which is 8 years old.

So, the total age is:
\[ 19 \text{ (Sally Two)} + 16 \text{ (Granny Red)} + 8 \text{ (Sally Four)} + 8 \text{ (Caboose)} = 51 \]

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"Okay, let me break it down for you in a simpler way.

Jessica has three debts:
- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

First, we add these up to find the total minimum monthly payment:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% of $1000:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, she wants to pay:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, to find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12:
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Jessica pays $18000 in a year. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{18000} \]"
"Billy needs to peel and cut each potato. It takes him 1.5 minutes to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut it. So, for one potato, it takes:

\[ 1.5 \text{ minutes} + 0.0833 \text{ minutes} = 1.5833 \text{ minutes} \]

Since he has 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for one potato by 60:

\[ 1.5833 \text{ minutes/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{95} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, they sell each gallon for $10 because they get 20 glasses per gallon and each glass sells for $0.50. So, for 5 gallons, they make $10 * 5 = $50 in total.

They made a profit of $25, which means the cost of making the lemonade was $50 - $25 = $25.

The cost of making one gallon of lemonade is $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, which totals $5 per gallon. So, for 5 gallons, the total cost is $5 * 5 = $25.

Therefore, they spent $25 on lemons.

The correct answer is: **$25**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 240 people in total, and 80 of them are Japanese. So, the rest must be Chinese. To find out how many Chinese people there are, we subtract the number of Japanese people from the total number of people:

\[ 240 - 80 = 160 \]

So, there are 160 Chinese people in the race. We are also told that there are 60 boys on the Chinese team. To find out how many girls there are, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese people:

\[ 160 - 60 = 100 \]

Therefore, there are 100 girls on the Chinese team. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler numbers to understand it better.

Zaid earns $6000 a month. He spends:
- Rent: 1/4 of $6000 = $1500
- Car fuel: 1/3 of $6000 = $2000

So, after spending on rent and car fuel, he has:
- Remaining amount: $6000 - $1500 - $2000 = $2500

Then, he donates half of the remaining amount to charity:
- Donation to charity: 1/2 of $2500 = $1250

After the donation, he has:
- Remaining amount: $2500 - $1250 = $1250

Now, he gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700:
- Remaining amount: $1250 - $200 - $700 = $350

So, the final amount of money Zaid will have left is $350. 

The correct answer is:
\boxed{350}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Bo has 40 crabs.

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs} \]

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs} \]

Now, we add up all the crabs:
\[ 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \text{ crabs} \]

So, the total number of crabs the three have together is 122. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{122}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Lloyd earns $10 per hour. In the first week, he tutored for 5 hours, so his earnings for the first week are:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

In the second week, he tutored for 8 hours, so his earnings for the second week are:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

To find out his total earnings for the two weeks, we add the earnings from both weeks together:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

So, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks. The correct answer is \$130."
"To find out how many votes the loser got, we first need to figure out how many votes the winner got. The winner got 3/4 of the total votes, and the total number of votes cast was 80.

So, we calculate the votes for the winner:
\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

This means the winner got 60 votes. Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser got is:
\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

So, the number of votes the loser got is 20. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, and these are five times the number of white carnations. So, if we let the number of white carnations be \( w \), then we have:
\[ 5w = 200 \]

To find \( w \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ w = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \]

Now, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. So, the number of red roses is:
\[ 4 \times 40 = 160 \]

Therefore, to keep Sandra happy, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.

The number of red roses that need to be delivered is:
\[
\boxed{160}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

We know Jan is 30 years old now. Two years ago, Jan was 28 years old. At that time, Mark was 5 years younger than half of Jan's age. So, half of Jan's age two years ago was \(28 / 2 = 14\). This means Mark was \(14 - 5 = 9\) years old two years ago. So, Mark's current age is \(9 + 2 = 11\) years old.

Now, Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's current age is \(11 + 2 = 13\) years old.

The options given in the question are not provided here, but based on the information given, Jean's age is 13.

So, the final answer is 13."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have two teams competing in a relay race where each team has four members, and each member runs 400 meters. The first team is very well-rounded, and each member runs their leg in exactly 55 seconds. So, the total time for the first team is:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

The second team is less well-rounded. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner 3 seconds faster than the first, so 57 seconds, the third runner 3 seconds faster than the second, so 54 seconds, and the fourth runner 3 seconds faster than the third, so 51 seconds. So, the total time for the second team is:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how many seconds the faster team wins by, we subtract the total time of the first team from the total time of the second team:
\[ 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team wins by 2 seconds. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. This gives us a probability of:

\[ P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Next, we need to find the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:

\[ P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:

\[ P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:

\[ P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, we need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We do this by finding the difference in probabilities and then converting it to a percentage:

\[ \text{Difference in probabilities} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \]

To find how much more likely it is, we divide this difference by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and then convert to a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage more likely} = \left( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \right) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\% \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this clearly. If Jenna's mom picked 20 apples and Jenna picked half as many, then Jenna picked half of 20, which is 10 apples. So, together they picked 20 + 10 = 30 apples. 

So, the total number of apples they both picked is 30. 

The options would be:
A) 15
B) 25
C) 30
D) 35

The correct answer is C) 30."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Russell distributes straw among the rodents and we need to find out how many rats are in each cage. Here's what we know:

- There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- There are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits.
- The total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160.

First, let's calculate how many pieces of straw are given to the hamsters:
\[ 10 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ pieces per hamster} = 50 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know how many pieces of straw are given to the rabbits:
\[ 20 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the pieces given to the hamsters and the rabbits from the total pieces of straw:
\[ 160 \text{ pieces} - 50 \text{ pieces} - 20 \text{ pieces} = 90 \text{ pieces} \]

These 90 pieces of straw are given to the rats. Since there are 3 cages of rats and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, we can find the total number of rats:
\[ \frac{90 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per rat}} = 15 \text{ rats} \]

Since there are 3 cages of rats, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages to find out how many rats are in each cage:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ rats}}{3 \text{ cages}} = 5 \text{ rats per cage} \]

So, the number of rats in each cage is 5. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mandy owes Benedict $100 and they agreed to have a 2% interest per month. After 3 months, we need to calculate how much interest Mandy has to pay.

First, let's find out how much interest Mandy has to pay in one month. The interest is 2% of $100, which is:
\[ 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]
So, the interest for one month is $2.

Now, for 3 months, the total interest would be:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

So, the total amount Mandy has to pay Benedict after 3 months is the original $100 plus the $6 interest:
\[ 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict **$106**.

The correct answer is **$106**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The trader buys wheat at $20 per bag and spends $2 to transport each bag. So, the total cost for each bag is $20 + $2 = $22. If the trader sells all the bags at $30 each and makes a profit of $400, we can figure out how many bags he sold.

First, let's see how much profit each bag brings. The profit per bag is $30 (selling price) - $22 (cost price) = $8. If the total profit is $400, we can find out how many bags he sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag.

So, the number of bags sold is $400 / $8 = 50 bags.

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we have the cost of the tickets, which is $20.25. They also spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, so the cost of the food is:
\[ 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \]

Now, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the food:
\[ 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.00 \]

They also went on 2 rides, each costing $33, so the total cost for the rides is:
\[ 2 \times 33 = 66 \]

Now, we add the cost of the tickets, food, and rides together:
\[ 36.00 + 66 = 102.00 \]

Since there are 3 friends, we divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each person paid:
\[ \frac{102.00}{3} = 34.00 \]

So, each person paid $34.00. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{34.00} \]"
"John collects peaches for 3 hours. If he collects 2 peaches every minute, we need to find out how many peaches he collects in total.

First, we calculate the total number of minutes in 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know he collects 2 peaches every minute. So, to find the total number of peaches he collects, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, the total number of peaches John collects is 360. 

The final answer is 360."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find out how much each duck needs per day by dividing 3.5 pounds by 7 days:

\[ \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

This means each duck needs 0.5 pounds of insects per day. Now, if we have a flock of ten ducks, we just multiply the daily amount needed for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is 5 pounds. 

The correct answer is: **5 pounds/day**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. Each year, he plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees. So, the net increase in trees each year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.
3. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.
4. So, after 10 years, without any trees dying, he would have \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
5. But after 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, 30% of 130 trees die, which is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\) trees.
6. Therefore, the number of trees left after the deaths is \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

So, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step:

On Friday morning, Sue has 18 pink plastic flamingos in her front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors take back one third of the flamingos and paint them white. One third of 18 is 6, so they take back and paint 6 flamingos white. This means they leave 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos in the yard.

On Sunday morning, they add another 18 pink flamingos to the yard. So, the total number of pink flamingos now is 12 + 18 = 30.

On Sunday morning, they also add 6 white flamingos to the yard.

Now, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos. We have 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos. The difference is 30 - 6 = 24.

So, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{24}
\]"
"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons and then subtract that from the $20 she has.

Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors, and each crayon costs $2. So, the total cost for the crayons is:
\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times 2 \text{ dollars per crayon} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the $20 Violetta has:
\[ 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the change Violetta will get is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30. So, if we add the cost of a pencil and an eraser together, we get:

\[ 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

This means a pen costs $1.50. Now, we need to find out how much 8 pens will cost. We do this by multiplying the cost of one pen by 8:

\[ 1.50 \times 8 = 12.00 \]

So, 8 pens will cost $12.00. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{12.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We start with 200 pounds of carrots and need to give 2 pounds to each of the 40 restaurants. 

First, we calculate how many pounds of carrots will be given out in total:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we subtract the total pounds given out from the initial amount:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is 120 pounds.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To find out how many children there are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

The total population is 23,786. There are 8,417 men and 9,092 women.

So, the number of children is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Number of children} = \text{Total population} - (\text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women}) \]
\[ \text{Number of children} = 23,786 - (8,417 + 9,092) \]
\[ \text{Number of children} = 23,786 - 17,509 \]
\[ \text{Number of children} = 6,277 \]

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6,277."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has in total.

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine started with 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collected three times the number of cards she initially had.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

5. **Total number of cards collected over the three months:**
   \[
   60 + 40 + 200 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

6. **Total number of cards Elaine has now:**
   Adding the initial number of cards to the total number of cards collected over the three months.
   \[
   20 + 200 = 220 \text{ cards}
   \]

So, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is 220. 

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{220}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mark edits 1000 sentences each week. Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. So, for Publisher A, he earns:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents per sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, so that's 10 cents per sentence. For Publisher B, he earns:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents per sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in total in a week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

So, Mark makes 15000 cents in a week. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Baldur gets water in two parts of the day: in the morning and in the afternoon. In the morning, he gets 5 pails of water, and in the afternoon, he gets 6 pails. Each pail has 5 liters of water.

First, we need to find out how many pails he gets in a day. He gets 5 pails in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon, so:
\[ 5 + 6 = 11 \text{ pails} \]

Now, we know that each pail has 5 liters of water. So, to find out the total amount of water he gets in a day, we multiply the number of pails by the amount of water each pail contains:
\[ 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters per pail} = 55 \text{ liters} \]

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day. The correct answer is 55 liters."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John gets a $5000 reward and a 5% raise in his salary. His original salary is $2000 a week. So, with the raise, his new salary is:
\[ 2000 + (2000 \times 0.05) = 2000 + 100 = 2100 \]
So, he makes $2100 a week now.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so his total earnings from his new salary for the year are:
\[ 2100 \times 52 = 109200 \]

But he also got a $5000 reward, so we add that to his total earnings:
\[ 109200 + 5000 = 114200 \]

So, the total amount of money John made that year is $114200.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{114200}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Josie has a farm that's 10 acres big. Each acre can grow 5 tons of grapes every year. So, if we multiply the number of acres by the tons of grapes per acre, we get the total tons of grapes:

\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Now, each ton of grapes can be turned into 2 barrels of wine. So, if we take the total tons of grapes and multiply that by the barrels of wine we can get from each ton, we get the total barrels of wine:

\[ 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, Josie's farm can produce 100 barrels of wine every year."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Carl eats a sandwich every day for 5 days. Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese. So, for the sandwiches, he uses:
\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \]

For breakfast, he eats omelets 3 days a week. Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich, so each omelet uses:
\[ 2 \text{ slices} + 1 \text{ slice} = 3 \text{ slices} \]
So, for the omelets, he uses:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

For dinner, he makes a big dish of macaroni and cheese and uses 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up all the cheese slices:
\[ 10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

So, the total number of cheese slices Carl used is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Okay, let me break it down simply:

Janet originally had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens. Then she bought some blue and red pens.

She bought 6 bags of blue pens, with 9 pens in each bag. So, the total number of blue pens she bought is:
\[ 6 \text{ bags} \times 9 \text{ pens/bag} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

She also bought 2 bags of red pens, with 6 pens in each bag. So, the total number of red pens she bought is:
\[ 2 \text{ bags} \times 6 \text{ pens/bag} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, let's add up all the pens she has now:
- Green pens: 22
- Yellow pens: 10
- Blue pens: 54
- Red pens: 12

Adding these together:
\[ 22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98 \]

So, Janet has 98 pens in total now. 

The final answer is: 98"
"To find out what score Brinley needs on her sixth test to get an average of 93, we can follow these steps:

First, let's add up the scores of the first five tests:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440 \]

Now, to have an average of 93 over six tests, the total sum of all six test scores should be:
\[ 93 \times 6 = 558 \]

So, the score Brinley needs on her sixth test is:
\[ 558 - 440 = 118 \]

Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 118 on her sixth test to get an average of 93. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{118} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many kilometers Micheal rode his bike in total.

First, we calculate the kilometers he rode in the first four weeks:
- He rode at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- So, each week he rode \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, he rode \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

Next, we calculate the kilometers he rode in the next three weeks:
- He decided to ride 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- So, each week he rode \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, he rode \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

Now, we add the kilometers from both periods:
- Total kilometers = \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

So, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To find out how much Joe's bag of candy weighs, we need to calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately and then add them together.

First, we know each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we know each candied apple weighs half the weight of a chocolate bar, so each candied apple weighs:
\[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]
Joe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:
\[ 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Now, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to get the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:
\[ 1000 + 1600 = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2600} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ cakes} \]

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cakes} \]

Now, to find out the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the cakes from each day:
\[ 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 \]

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is 76. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{76} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We know that half a dozen plates cost $6000. So, if we have half a dozen plates, each plate costs $6000 divided by 6, which is $1000 per plate.

Now, the problem says that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. We already know the total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000, so twenty dozen cups cost $6000 - $1200 = $4800.

Twenty dozen cups mean 20 * 12 = 240 cups. If 240 cups cost $4800, then the cost of one cup is $4800 divided by 240.

Let's do the division: $4800 ÷ 240 = $20.

So, the total cost of buying each cup is $20.

The correct answer is **$20**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Sara wants to buy a jacket that costs $30 and 2 pairs of shoes, each costing $20. So, the total cost for the jacket and shoes is:
\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Sara already has $10 saved. So, she needs to earn:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits and she babysits 4 times, so she earns:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

The remaining money she needs to earn is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $40. Let's call the number of times she needs to mow the lawn \( x \). So:
\[ 4x = 40 \]
\[ x = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. Also, he has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's say the number of red chickens is \( r \). Then the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).

Each red chicken gives 3 eggs a day, so \( r \) red chickens give \( 3r \) eggs a day.
Each white chicken gives 5 eggs a day, so \( r + 2 \) white chickens give \( 5(r + 2) \) eggs a day.

The total number of eggs collected every day is the sum of the eggs from red and white chickens:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r = 32 \]
\[ r = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens. To check, if he has 4 red chickens, then he has \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) white chickens. The total eggs would be:
\[ 3(4) + 5(6) = 12 + 30 = 42 \]

This matches the number of eggs Jerry collects every day. Therefore, the number of red chickens Jerry has is 4.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The park is a rectangle with a length of 6 miles and a width of 1.5 miles. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

So, we plug in the values:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we know Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he spends walking, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. The next day, she counted 50 more than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers. By the end of the second day, she had counted 100 + 150 = 250 customers.

Now, we know the total number of customers over the three days is 500. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers from the first two days from the total number of customers. So, 500 - 250 = 250 customers on the third day.

Therefore, the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day is 250."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, if the small pool had \( S \) gallons of water 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 2S \) gallons.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 2S + 4 \times 4 = 2S + 16 \) gallons, and the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons.

But we also know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so:

\[ 2S + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]
\[ 2S + 16 = 2S + 32 \]

This doesn't make sense because it would mean \( 16 = 32 \), which is wrong. So, let's look at the current situation.

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, if the small pool has \( S \) gallons now, the big pool has \( 4S \) gallons now.

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, the current amount of water in the big pool is \( 4S \) and the current amount of water in the small pool is \( S \).

We know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had \( 2S + 16 \) gallons and the small pool had \( S + 16 \) gallons. But since the pools are leaking, the current amount of water in the big pool is:

\[ 2S + 16 - 4 \times 4 = 2S + 16 - 16 = 2S \]

And the current amount of water in the small pool is:

\[ S + 16 - 4 \times 4 = S + 16 - 16 = S \]

Since the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, we have:

\[ 2S = 4S \]

This doesn't make sense because it would mean \( 2S = 4S \), which is wrong. So, let's solve it differently.

We know that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so:

\[ 4S = 2S + 16 \]

Solving for \( S \):

\[ 4S - 2S = 16 \]
\[ 2S = 16 \]
\[ S = 8 \]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To figure out how many hours Lori needs to work, we first need to find out the total cost of the shoes and the belt. The shoes cost $320.00 and the belt costs $32.00. So, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

This means Lori needs $352.00 to buy both the shoes and the belt. Since her job pays her $8.00 per hour, we need to find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

So, Lori needs to work 44 hours to earn the money she needs. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an extra 10% of that amount. So, first, we need to find out what 10% of $2000 is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

So, the total amount she promised to return is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Janeth is going to pay $165 every month for 12 months. So, the total amount she will pay over 12 months is:
\[ 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Now, to find out how much she will still owe after 12 months, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she promised to return:
\[ 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is $220. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know there are 4 roses in the vase. The problem also tells us that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, to find out how many dahlias there are, we add 7 to the number of roses:

\[ 4 \text{ roses} + 7 = 11 \text{ dahlias} \]

Now, to find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and dahlias together:

\[ 4 \text{ roses} + 11 \text{ dahlias} = 15 \text{ flowers} \]

So, the total number of flowers in the vase is 15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler numbers.

1. Harriet is currently 21 years old.
2. Since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.
3. Adrian is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian is \(21 \times 3 = 63\) years old.

Now, let's find out their ages in three years:
- Harriet will be \(21 + 3 = 24\) years old.
- Zack will be \(42 + 3 = 45\) years old.
- Adrian will be \(63 + 3 = 66\) years old.

To find the average age in three years, we add their ages together and divide by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

So, the average age of the three in three years is 45. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, let's break down the information given:

- Naomi scored 68 points.
- Yuri scored 10 more than half of what Naomi scored. So, we calculate half of Naomi's score and then add 10:
  \[
  \text{Half of Naomi's score} = \frac{68}{2} = 34
  \]
  \[
  \text{Yuri's score} = 34 + 10 = 44
  \]
- Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, we add 17 to Naomi's score:
  \[
  \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
  \]

Now, let's add up the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

The total points scored by all four students is 251. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

Therefore, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to add up the time she spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:
- It takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
- She solved 3 crossword puzzles.

So, the time spent on crossword puzzles is:
\[ 10 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 3 \text{ puzzles} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:
- It takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
- She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.

So, the time spent on sudoku puzzles is:
\[ 5 \text{ minutes/puzzle} \times 8 \text{ puzzles} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time spent on both puzzles:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Carmen spent playing these games is 70 minutes."
"Initially, the tank has 120 liters of water. Celine uses 90 liters to water her garden, so the tank has:

\[ 120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters} \]

Then, she collects rainwater that is twice the amount left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters} \]

Adding the collected rainwater to the remaining water in the tank, the total amount of water in the tank now is:

\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters} \]

So, the final amount of water in the tank is 90 liters. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"

To find out the total number of flowers he plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together:

\[ 90 + 50 = 140 \]

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{140} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

In the first year, the company spent $15000 on advertising.

For the second year, they spent a third of that amount. So, we calculate a third of $15000:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 15000 = 5000
\]

So, in the second year, they spent $5000 on advertising.

Now, to find the total amount spent over the two years, we add the amounts from both years:

\[
15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20000.

The correct answer is: **$20000**"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for Carlos and Benji.

First, we calculate how much Carlos pays for renting the canoe. The canoe costs $30 per hour, and he rents it for 3 hours.

\[
30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

So, Carlos pays $90.

Next, we calculate how much Benji pays for renting the banana boat raft. The raft costs $18 per hour, and he rents it for 5 hours.

\[
18 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

So, Benji pays $90.

Now, we add the amounts they both paid to find the total cost.

\[
90 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars} = 180 \, \text{dollars}
\]

So, the total amount they will pay for their rentals is $180."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Andrew takes 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. The trip back from Rochester to New Jersey by car takes half as many days as the trip to Rochester. So, the trip back by car takes \(6 \div 2 = 3\) days.

Now, if Andrew goes to Rochester by bus and then returns by car, we need to add the days for both trips together:
- 6 days (to Rochester by bus)
- 3 days (back by car)

So, the total number of days he will travel is \(6 + 3 = 9\) days.

Therefore, the total number of days Andrew will travel is 9 days.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

James starts with:
- 30 fire type cards
- 20 grass type cards
- 40 water type cards

He loses 8 water type cards, so he now has:
\[ 40 - 8 = 32 \text{ water type cards} \]

He also buys 14 more grass type cards, so he now has:
\[ 20 + 14 = 34 \text{ grass type cards} \]

Now, let's add up all the cards he has:
\[ 30 \text{ (fire)} + 34 \text{ (grass)} + 32 \text{ (water)} = 96 \text{ total cards} \]

The number of water type cards is 32. To find the percentage of water type cards, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \]

So:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \times 100 = 33.33\% \]

Rounding 33.33% to the nearest integer gives us 33%.

Therefore, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33%.

The final answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Chad starts with a base burrito that costs $6.50. He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and two sauces at $0.25 each. So, the cost of the extra items is:

- Extra meat: $2.00
- Extra cheese: $1.00
- Avocado: $1.00
- Two sauces: $0.25 * 2 = $0.50

Adding these together:
\[ 6.50 + 2.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 + 0.50 = 11.00 \]

Chad then decides to upgrade his meal for an extra $3.00, which includes chips and a drink. Adding this to the previous total:
\[ 11.00 + 3.00 = 14.00 \]

Chad has a gift card worth $5.00 that he uses at checkout. Subtracting the value of the gift card from the total:
\[ 14.00 - 5.00 = 9.00 \]

So, the amount Chad still owes is $9.00.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{9.00} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, which means her mom can place 2 pieces per minute.

Together, they can place:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces. We do this by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes is exactly 1 hour.

So, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of these watermelons were ready for harvest. To find out how many that is, we calculate 30% of 120:
   \[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]
   So, 36 watermelons were ready for harvest.
3. This means there were \(120 - 36 = 84\) watermelons left.
4. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]
   So, 63 watermelons were ready for harvest.
5. This means the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
   \[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

So, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is 21. The correct answer is 21."
"Okay, let me break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. So, the total cost for the cars is:
\[ 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000 \]

Next, he has to pay 10% tax on these cars. To find the tax, we calculate:
\[ 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000 \]

So, the total cost including the tax is:
\[ 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 \]

After that, he has to pay $1,000 for registration on each car. For 12 cars, the total registration cost is:
\[ 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000 \]

Now, we add the registration cost to the total cost including tax:
\[ 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000 \]

So, the total amount Mark pays is $276,000. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{276000}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

On Monday, Robert collected 20 shells. Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, so she collected:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ shells} \]

On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. So, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2:
\[ 25 \times 2 = 50 \text{ shells} \]

Therefore, Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

If there are 50 ants in the garden, and the number of bugs is half the number of ants, then the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Now, to find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs together:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

So, the total number of insects in the garden is 75. 

If the question was in a multiple-choice format, the options might look like this:

A) 25
B) 50
C) 75
D) 100

The correct answer would be C) 75."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We start with 36 penguins. One-third of them jump into the ocean. To find out how many that is, we do:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Next, another one-third go into the cave. Again, we calculate one-third of 36:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \]

So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, we add the penguins that went into the ocean and the ones that went into the cave:

\[ 12 + 12 = 24 \]

This means 24 penguins are no longer sunbathing. To find out how many are left, we subtract the 24 from the original 36:

\[ 36 - 24 = 12 \]

So, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is 12. The correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Steve eats 6 tomatoes a day. His girlfriend eats half of that, so she eats 3 tomatoes a day. Together, they eat:

\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate their weekly intake:

\[ 9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes a week. To find out how many vines they need, we divide their total weekly intake by the number of tomatoes one vine produces:

\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

So, Steve needs 21 vines. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To figure out how many pizzas John needs to order, we can break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out the total number of pizza slices John needs. Since he has 20 friends and each friend will have 4 slices, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices per friend:
   \[
   20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. Next, we need to determine how many pizzas are required to get these 80 slices. Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

The correct answer is: 10"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Ram starts with 25 pens. He can make a new pen by mixing the ink from 5 empty pens. So, if he has 25 pens, he can make:

\[ \frac{25}{5} = 5 \]

new pens. This means he can make 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens he has.

Now, the total number of pens he has is the original 25 pens plus the 5 new pens he made:

\[ 25 + 5 = 30 \]

So, the total number of pens Ram gets is 30. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{30}\)"
"Johnny started with $20 and added $10 more, so he had $20 + $10 = $30. He then invested this money and it tripled. So, after a year, he had $30 * 3 = $90. 

The final answer is $90."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler numbers.

We know Jessa is 20 years old.

Joan is five years older than Jessa, so:
\[ \text{Joan's age} = 20 + 5 = 25 \]

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so:
\[ \text{Mary's age} = 25 - 2 = 23 \]

Now, to find the sum of their ages:
\[ \text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 20 + 25 = 45 \]
\[ 45 + 23 = 68 \]

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{68}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We start with 1000 students in the hall. 

First, 30% of them went out through exit A. To find out how many that is, we calculate 30% of 1000:
\[ 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \]
So, 300 students went out through exit A.

After 300 students left through exit A, we have:
\[ 1000 - 300 = 700 \]
students left in the hall.

Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find out how many that is, we calculate 3/5 of 700:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \]
So, 420 students went out through exit B.

Now, the rest of the students went out through exit C. To find out how many that is, we subtract the number of students who went out through exit B from the remaining students:
\[ 700 - 420 = 280 \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{280}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know John has 54 candies. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can find out how many candies Robert has by dividing John's candies by 2:
\[ \text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we add 6 to Robert's candies to find out how many candies James has:
\[ \text{James's candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 = 21 \]

So, John has 21 more candies than James. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

Dolly has 2 books, and Pandora has 1 book. Both of them read each other's books as well as their own.

First, let's see how many books Dolly reads:
- Dolly reads her own books: 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's book: 1 book.
- So, Dolly reads a total of \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

Next, let's see how many books Pandora reads:
- Pandora reads her own book: 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's books: 2 books.
- So, Pandora reads a total of \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, if we add up all the books they read together:
- Dolly reads 3 books.
- Pandora reads 3 books.
- So, together they read \(3 + 3 = 6\) books.

Therefore, the total number of books they collectively read is 6."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mike had 5 pen pals initially. He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he has 3 pen pals left. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 3 pen pals in kind, so he also sends 30 pages a week. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we first convert the total number of pages into minutes:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we convert the total minutes into hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Jason's phone plan allows him 1000 minutes per month. He makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day. Since there are 30 days in the month, he uses:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

He also used an extra 300 minutes for calls to other people. So, the total minutes he used this month is:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the total minutes used from the plan's allowance:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left. The correct answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Griffin starts with 24 fries. Kyle takes 5 fries, so Griffin has:
\[ 24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries} \]

Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, so Billy takes:
\[ 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries} \]
Now Griffin has:
\[ 19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries} \]

Colby takes 3 less than what Kyle took, so Colby takes:
\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries} \]
Now Griffin has:
\[ 9 - 2 = 7 \text{ fries} \]

Let's say Ginger gives Griffin \(x\) fries. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has:
\[ 7 + x \text{ fries} \]

According to the problem, after all these actions, Griffin ends up with 27 fries. So we can set up the equation:
\[ 7 + x = 27 \]

Solving for \(x\):
\[ x = 27 - 7 = 20 \]

Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another. The difference in the number of snails is:
\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

The problem states that this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. So, if we let the number of fish in each aquarium be \( F \), then the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \). According to the problem:
\[ 28 = 2 \times 2F \]
\[ 28 = 4F \]

To find \( F \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ F = \frac{28}{4} \]
\[ F = 7 \]

So, the number of fish in each aquarium is 7. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours the makeup artist works in total. She works 4 times a week and each session takes 6 hours. So, in one week, she works:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Since the movie lasts 5 weeks, the total number of hours she works is:
\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \text{ hours} \]

The makeup artist charges $250 for each hour. So, the total cost before any discount is:
\[ 120 \times 250 = 30000 \text{ dollars} \]

Jean gets a 10% discount on this total. To find the discount amount, we calculate 10% of $30,000:
\[ 0.10 \times 30000 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 30000 - 3000 = 27000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jean pays:
\[ \boxed{27000} \]"
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to add up all the money Isabelle spent on the party supplies. She spent:

- $12 on ingredients for the cake
- $43 on birthday presents
- $15 on decorations
- $4 on invitations
- $22 on goodie bags

Now, let's add these amounts together:

\[ 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96 \]

Isabelle split this total cost evenly among her three parents. So, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[ \frac{96}{3} = 32 \]

Each person paid $32. 

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The chef bought 4 bags of onions, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight of the onions is:

\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know that a pound of onions costs $1.50. So, to find out how much the chef spent, we multiply the total weight of the onions by the cost per pound:

\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the chef spent $300.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day:
- On Monday, she ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, she ate 13 cookies.

Now, we calculate how many cookies Sue ate:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Next, we add up the total cookies Sue ate:
- Monday: 20 cookies
- Tuesday: 26 cookies
- Total for Sue: \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies

Now, we calculate the total cookies Sue's sister ate:
- Monday: 5 cookies
- Tuesday: 13 cookies
- Total for her sister: \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies

Each cookie has 200 calories. So, we calculate the total calories for each:
- Sue's calories: \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories
- Her sister's calories: \(18 \times 200 = 3600\) calories

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract:
- \(9200 - 3600 = 5600\) calories

So, Sue consumed 5600 more calories than her sister. The answer is \(\boxed{5600}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 3 classes, and each class has 20 students. So, the total number of students in the school is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

2. Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls in the school is:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ boys and } 30 \text{ girls} \]

3. We are given the number of girls in the first and second classes:
- First class: 15 girls
- Second class: 12 girls

So, the number of girls in the third class can be found by subtracting the girls in the first and second classes from the total number of girls:
\[ 30 - (15 + 12) = 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ girls in the third class} \]

4. Since each class has 20 students, and there are 3 girls in the third class, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ 20 - 3 = 17 \]

So, the number of boys in the third class is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Travis started with 61 apps on his tablet. He decided to get rid of some apps he didn't use, so he deleted 9 apps. That means he had:

\[ 61 - 9 = 52 \]

apps left. Then, he added 18 new apps to his tablet. So, the total number of apps he has now is:

\[ 52 + 18 = 70 \]

So, the number of apps on his tablet now is 70. 

The correct answer is 70."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. So, that's a total of:
\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ animals} \]

Today, Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's say he killed \( c \) cougars today. Then he killed \( 3c \) wolves. We also know he killed 3 fewer cougars than last night, so:
\[ c = 15 - 3 = 12 \text{ cougars} \]
So, he killed:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ wolves} \]

Now, let's add up all the animals he killed:
- Last night: 10 wolves + 15 cougars = 25 animals
- Today: 36 wolves + 12 cougars = 48 animals

So, the total number of animals killed is:
\[ 25 + 48 = 73 \]

Therefore, the total number of animals Rick killed is 73."

Bill starts on the 3rd floor. The problem tells us to find the floor he ends up on by using the formula: \(4 \times \text{starting floor} + 6\).

So, we start by multiplying the starting floor (which is 3) by 4:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

Next, we add 6 to the result:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \]

Therefore, Bill is now on the 18th floor.

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times. Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel. To find out how many times Anne went down, we first calculate 30% of 30:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9 \]

So, Anne went down:

\[ 30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times} \]

Now, Robert went down the slide 4 times as many times as Anne did. So we multiply the number of times Anne went down by 4:

\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, the total number of cows is:

\[ 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows} \]

Then, Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows. The total number of cows now is:

\[ 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows} \]

These 40 new cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls. So, each stall gets:

\[ \frac{40 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 2 \text{ cows/stall} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 2 cows, the number of cows in 8 stalls is:

\[ 8 \text{ stalls} \times 2 \text{ cows/stall} = 16 \text{ cows} \]

So, the number of cows in 8 of the stalls is 16. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank.

First, we calculate the value of each type of coin:

1. **Pennies:**
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - So, the total value of the pennies is \(100 \times 0.01 = 1.00\) dollars.

   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - So, the total value of the nickels is \(40 \times 0.05 = 2.00\) dollars.

3. **Dimes:**
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - So, the total value of the dimes is \(20 \times 0.10 = 2.00\) dollars.

4. **Dollar Bills:**
   - Brady has 40 pieces of dollar bills.
   - Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.
   - So, the total value of the dollar bills is \(40 \times 1.00 = 40.00\) dollars.

Now, we add up all these values to find the total amount of money:

\[1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00\]

So, Brady has a total of $45.00 in his piggy bank. The correct answer is \(\boxed{45.00}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the redwood tree is 200 feet tall, and each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds. First, we need to find out how many 10-foot sections are in the tree:

\[
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
\]

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the tree before any damage is:

\[
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, so 70% of the tree remains. To find out how much the tree weighs after the termites ate, we calculate 70% of 8000 pounds:

\[
8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, the final weight of the redwood tree is 5600 pounds. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}
\]"
"To find out how much Nancy has to pay, we need to calculate the cost of the overdue books and add the flat fee.

First, we calculate the cost of the overdue books. Nancy owes $0.50 for each of the 8 books:
\[ 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \]

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue:
\[ 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00 \]

So, the total amount Nancy has to pay is:
\[ \boxed{6.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Andrea has 52 apples. According to the problem, Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal. So, if we let the number of apples Jamal has be \( J_a \), we can write:
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
To find \( J_a \), we subtract 8 from 52:
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]
So, Jamal has 44 apples.

The problem also says Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, if Jamal has 44 apples, he must have:
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]
So, Jamal has 48 bananas.

Now, we know Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, if Jamal has 48 bananas, Andrea must have:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]
So, Andrea has 24 bananas.

Now, let's add up all the fruits:
- Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, which totals to \( 52 + 24 = 76 \) fruits.
- Jamal has 44 apples and 48 bananas, which totals to \( 44 + 48 = 92 \) fruits.

So, the total number of fruits is:
\[ 76 + 92 = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To figure out how much flour Carla needs, we first need to know how many cookies she's making in total. Today, she's making 36 cookies, and tomorrow, she's making 30 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies} \]

Now, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make 12 cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we can set up a simple ratio:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}} \]

To solve for \(x\), we can cross-multiply and divide:

\[ x = \frac{2 \times 66}{12} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups} \]

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We start with 9,300 pennies in a cup. The question asks for the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup. So, we need to find two thirds of 9,300 pennies.

First, we calculate two thirds of 9,300:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 9300 = \frac{2 \times 9300}{3} = \frac{18600}{3} = 6100
\]

So, there are 6100 pennies in the stack. Now, we need to convert these pennies into dollars. Since 100 pennies make 1 dollar, we divide 6100 by 100:

\[
6100 \div 100 = 61
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is 61 dollars. 

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{61}
\]"
"Maddison starts with 5 boxes, and each box has 50 marbles. So, she has:

\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \text{ marbles} \]

Then she gets 20 more marbles from her friend. So, the total number of marbles she has now is:

\[ 250 + 20 = 270 \text{ marbles} \]

The final answer is 270."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half the number of trees Chris has, so:

\[
\text{Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees:

\[
\text{Twice the number of Ferdinand's trees} = 2 \times 3 = 6
\]

\[
\text{Harry's trees} = 6 + 5 = 11
\]

Now, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand:

\[
\text{Difference} = 11 - 3 = 8
\]

So, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Carmen has $100.

Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, so:
\[ 100 + 25 = 125 \]

Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, so:
\[ 125 + 50 = 175 \]

Now, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add their individual amounts together:
\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \]

So, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is:
\[ \boxed{400} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Mrs. Cruz wants to buy a house that doesn't cost more than $400,000. She found a house that costs $350,000. There are two extra costs she has to pay: a 5% brokerage fee and a 12% transfer fee.

First, let's calculate the brokerage fee:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

Next, let's calculate the transfer fee:
\[ 12\% \text{ of } 350,000 = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

Now, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price:
\[ 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. To find out how much more the total price is than her budget, we subtract her budget from the total price:
\[ 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than what Mrs. Cruz can afford. The answer is $9,500."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Mr. Tan got after selling his house.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price. So, we calculate 3% of $400,000.
   \[
   3\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. So, we calculate 5% of $400,000.
   \[
   5\% \text{ of } 400,000 = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   The total expenses are the sum of the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.
   \[
   12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale:**
   The net proceeds from the sale of the house is the selling price minus the total expenses.
   \[
   400,000 - 32,000 = 368,000
   \]

5. **Subtract the loan repayment:**
   Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.
   \[
   368,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
   \]

So, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is $118,000. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{118000}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.
2. To heat the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 40% longer than 20 minutes. So, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
   \[ 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]
   Adding this to the initial 20 minutes:
   \[ 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes} \]
3. After heating the oil to 400 degrees, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil. So, we subtract 5 minutes from the 28 minutes:
   \[ 28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes} \]
4. Now, we add up all the times:
   \[ 20 \text{ (heating to 300 degrees)} + 28 \text{ (heating to 400 degrees)} + 23 \text{ (cooking)} = 71 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is 71 minutes. 

The final answer is: 71 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the cost for the newspaper ads:
- Each newspaper ad costs $5.
- The real estate agent bought 50 newspaper ads.

So, the total cost for newspaper ads is:
\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \]

Next, we calculate the cost for the television ads:
- Each television ad costs $75.
- The real estate agent bought 15 television ads.

So, the total cost for television ads is:
\[ 75 \times 15 = 1125 \]

Now, we add the costs together to find the total amount spent:
\[ 250 + 1125 = 1375 \]

So, the real estate agent spent a total of $1375 on all the ads. The final answer is $1375."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know the juggler can juggle 16 balls in total. Half of these balls are golf balls, so we divide 16 by 2 to find out how many golf balls there are:

\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]

So, there are 8 golf balls. Now, half of these golf balls are blue, so we divide 8 by 2 to find out how many blue golf balls there are:

\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \]

Therefore, there are 4 blue golf balls. The final answer is 4."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Mary has 3 bags of M&Ms. The first bag has 300 M&Ms. The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first bag, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms. The third bag has half the number of M&Ms as the first bag, so it has \(300 / 2 = 150\) M&Ms.

Now, to find the total number of M&Ms, we add the M&Ms from all three bags:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

So, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we have 2 houses. Each house has 3 bedrooms, and each bedroom has 2 windows. So, for one house, the number of windows in the bedrooms is:
\[ 3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows} \]

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is:
\[ 6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows} \]

Next, each house has an additional 4 windows that are not connected to the bedrooms. So, for both houses, the total number of additional windows is:
\[ 4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows together:
\[ 12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows} \]

So, the total number of windows between the two houses is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

The mother buys three things:
- Cocoa for $4.20
- Laundry for $9.45
- Pasta for $1.35

First, we add these amounts together:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 \]

Adding $4.20 and $9.45:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65 \]

Then, adding $1.35 to $13.65:
\[ 13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the total cost from the amount she paid:
\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is:
\[ \boxed{5.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we know the body of the sweater takes 900 stitches. The collar takes a tenth of that, so:
\[ \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \]

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so:
\[ \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \]

Now, we add up the stitches for the collar and the rosette:
\[ 90 + 180 = 270 \]

The whole sweater is 1800 stitches. So, the stitches for the sleeves are:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2:
\[ \frac{1530}{2} = 765 \]

So, each sleeve takes 765 stitches. The final answer is \(\boxed{765}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, the total cost for the tomato seeds is:
\[ 20 \times 40 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, she bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. So, the total cost for the celery seeds is:
\[ 80 \times 30 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out the total amount of money she used to buy the seeds, we add the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds:
\[ 800 + 2400 = 3200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is:
\[ \boxed{3200} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Sean has to memorize the lyrics to a solo song. The song has 54 lines.

Next, for the first scene, the scene has twice as many lines as the song. So, the first scene has:
\[ 2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines} \]

Only a third of these lines are Sean's. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines} \]

For the second scene, it has six more lines than the song. So, the second scene has:
\[ 54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines} \]

Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's. So, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines} \]

Now, we add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:
\[ 54 \text{ (song)} + 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} = 138 \text{ lines} \]

So, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is 138."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Carly started with 80 cards. First, we find out how many had the letter A. Since \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the cards had A, we calculate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
\]

So, 32 cards had A. This leaves us with:

\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 48 cards had the letter B. Since \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the remaining cards had B, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]

Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining 24 cards had the letter C. Since \( \frac{5}{8} \) of the remaining cards had C, we calculate:

\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
24 - 15 = 9
\]

So, the number of cards that had the letter D is 9. 

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}

"To find out how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

So, the time for the small holes is:
\[ 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

So, the time for the large holes is:
\[ 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for the small holes and the large holes together:
\[ 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the sum of Mico's and Marco's current ages is 20. So, if we add 10 years to each of their ages, we are essentially adding 10 to Mico's age and 10 to Marco's age. 

So, if Mico is \( M \) years old now, in 10 years he will be \( M + 10 \) years old. Similarly, if Marco is \( R \) years old now, in 10 years he will be \( R + 10 \) years old.

The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ M + R + 10 + 10 \]
\[ M + R + 20 \]

Since we know that \( M + R = 20 \), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

So, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 40. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's solve this step by step.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam. So if Sam's age is \( S \), then Ruby's age is \( 6S \).

The second piece of information tells us that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, in 9 years, Sam will be \( S + 9 \) years old, and Ruby will be \( 6S + 9 \) years old. According to the problem, at that time, Ruby's age will be 3 times Sam's age, so we can write the equation:

\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, expand the right side of the equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Next, subtract \( 3S \) from both sides to get all the \( S \) terms on one side:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Then, subtract 9 from both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Finally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 6 \]

So, Sam is currently 6 years old. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of the popsicles. Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each. So, we do:

\[ 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \]

So, the cost of the popsicles is $5.00.

Next, we calculate the cost of the ice cream bars. Peter bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each. So, we do:

\[ 4 \times 0.50 = 2 \]

So, the cost of the ice cream bars is $2.00.

Now, we add the cost of the popsicles and the cost of the ice cream bars to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[ 5 + 2 = 7 \]

So, the total amount Peter paid is $7.00.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that each cobra has 70 spots. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, a mamba must have half the spots of a cobra. So, a mamba has:

\[ 70 \div 2 = 35 \text{ spots} \]

Now, we have 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots, so the total spots for all the cobras are:

\[ 40 \times 70 = 2800 \text{ spots} \]

We also have 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots, so the total spots for all the mambas are:

\[ 60 \times 35 = 2100 \text{ spots} \]

Adding the spots of all the cobras and mambas together gives us the total number of spots:

\[ 2800 + 2100 = 4900 \text{ spots} \]

To find half the number of spots, we divide the total spots by 2:

\[ 4900 \div 2 = 2450 \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2450} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many people are at the soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's \(12 \times 2 = 24\) guests. Adding the team members and coaches to the guests, we get:

\[12 \text{ team members} + 3 \text{ coaches} + 24 \text{ guests} = 39 \text{ people}\]

Now, each pizza can serve 3 people. To find out how many pizzas Maddy needs, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza can serve:

\[39 \div 3 = 13 \text{ pizzas}\]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:

\[13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars}\]

So, Maddy will spend \(\boxed{195}\) dollars."
"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we know that each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long and she uses 8 of them. So, the total length of the topaz gemstones is:
   \[
   8 \text{ gemstones} \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. The total length of the necklace is 25 inches. So, the length left for the sterling silver beads is:
   \[
   25 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 17 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. Each sterling silver bead is 0.25 inches long. To find out how many beads fit into the 17 inches, we divide:
   \[
   \frac{17 \text{ inches}}{0.25 \text{ inches/bead}} = 68 \text{ beads}
   \]

So, Katerina uses 68 sterling silver beads per necklace. The answer is 68."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many stories each person wrote in the second week:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week. So in the second week, she wrote \(20 \times 2 = 40\) stories.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week. So in the second week, he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week. So in the second week, she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

Next, we add up the stories written in the first week:
- Alani: 20 stories
- Braylen: 40 stories
- Margot: 60 stories
Total for the first week: \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) stories.

Then, we add up the stories written in the second week:
- Alani: 40 stories
- Braylen: 80 stories
- Margot: 120 stories
Total for the second week: \(40 + 80 + 120 = 240\) stories.

Finally, we add the totals from the first and second weeks:
Total number of stories: \(120 + 240 = 360\) stories.

So, the total number of stories they wrote altogether is 360. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{360}\)."

\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

She also has 2 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. So, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

Now, she buys a can of pop that costs 55 cents. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the cost of the can of pop from the total amount:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

So, the number of cents Kelly will have left is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the flag has a total of 76 stars.
2. There are 3 rows with 8 stars each, so that's \(3 \times 8 = 24\) stars.
3. There are 2 rows with 6 stars each, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) stars.
4. Now, let's add the stars in the rows with 8 and 6 stars: \(24 + 12 = 36\) stars.
5. To find out how many stars are left for the rows with 5 stars, we subtract the stars in the other rows from the total: \(76 - 36 = 40\) stars.
6. Since each of these remaining rows has 5 stars, we divide the remaining stars by 5: \(40 \div 5 = 8\) rows.

So, there are 8 rows of 5 stars. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 80 flagstones, and each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. So, the total weight of 80 flagstones is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, each truck can carry 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks we need, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

So, we need 3 trucks to transport all the flagstones in one trip.

The number of trucks needed is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour and it covers 480 miles. To find out how long it took, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

So, for the fast lane:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{fast lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the fast lane, so its speed is:

\[
\text{Speed}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

To find out how long it took the car in the slow lane to cover the same 480 miles, we use the same formula:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the 480 miles. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ali has 22 medals. Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so:
\[ 22 - 5 = 17 \]
So, together they have:
\[ 22 + 17 = 39 \]
medals.

The problem states that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This means the total number of medals given out is 10 times the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together. So we calculate:
\[ 39 \times 10 = 390 \]

Therefore, the total number of medals given out for counting is:
\[ \boxed{390} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We have 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars is:
   \[
   8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars}
   \]

2. There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. So, the total number of chocolate bars the adults get is:
   \[
   4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars}
   \]

3. Now, we subtract the chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars:
   \[
   40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars}
   \]

4. There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them. So, each child gets:
   \[
   \frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child}
   \]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works for 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

But she takes a 30-minute break, so the actual time she works is 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.

She earns $5 every 10 minutes. So, in 10 minutes, she earns $5. To find out how much she earns in 1 minute, we divide $5 by 10, which gives us $0.5 per minute.

Now, to find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we multiply 150 by $0.5. So, 150 * $0.5 = $75.

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns for the online task is $75."
"Okay, let's go through the problem again step by step.

In the first three rounds:
- Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

Now, in the fourth round:
- Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he doesn't get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point.

So, after the fourth round:
- Mike has \(21 + 0 = 21\) points.
- Jim has \(18 + 0 = 18\) points.
- Tony has \(42 + 1 = 43\) points.

Now, let's add up all their points:
\[21 + 18 + 43 = 82\]

So, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{82}\)."
"Will buys 15 oranges. He asks his two sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old. The oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest son is half as old as the oldest, so the youngest son is 4 years old.

The oldest son washes 8 oranges, and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. So, the total number of oranges washed is:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \]

This means the number of oranges left unwashed is:

\[ 15 - 12 = 3 \]

So, the number of oranges left unwashed is 3. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

On the first day, Darren did:
- 100 pushups
- 50 squats
- 20 dumbbell presses

On the second day, he did:
- 20 more pushups than the first day, so that's 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
- 10 fewer squats than the first day, so that's 50 - 10 = 40 squats
- Double the number of dumbbell presses from the first day, so that's 20 * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

Now, let's add up the total for each activity over the two days:

**Total pushups:**
- First day: 100
- Second day: 120
- Total: 100 + 120 = 220

**Total squats:**
- First day: 50
- Second day: 40
- Total: 50 + 40 = 90

**Total dumbbell presses:**
- First day: 20
- Second day: 40
- Total: 20 + 40 = 60

Now, let's add up all the totals:
- Total pushups: 220
- Total squats: 90
- Total dumbbell presses: 60
- Total activities: 220 + 90 + 60 = 370

So, the total count of the activities he did in the two days is 370. The correct answer is 370."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and there are 5 people in the household. They eat at lunch and dinner, so that's 2 meals a day.

First, let's find out how much rice the whole household eats in one day:
\[ 5 \text{ people} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal/person} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much rice they eat in one week. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \]

Now, we have a 42 kg bag of rice, and we need to find out how many weeks it will last:
\[ \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \]

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we need to add up all the crates he sold during the week and then subtract that number from his target of 120 crates.

First, let's add up the crates sold each day:
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.
- Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

So, Sam sold 65 crates during the week. His target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was short, we subtract the crates he sold from his target:
\[ 120 - 65 = 55 \]

Therefore, Sam was 55 crates short of his target for the week.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{55} \]"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much John pays a year for driving.

First, we need to figure out how many miles John drives in a year. He drives 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so that's 60 miles each day. He does this 5 days a week, so that's 300 miles a week. There are 50 weeks in a year, so he drives 15,000 miles a year (300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year).

Next, we need to calculate the cost of driving those miles. He's charged $2 per mile, so the cost for the miles is 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Now, we need to add the bonus he gives the driver. He gives a $150 bonus each month, and there are 12 months in a year, so the total bonus is $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800.

Finally, we add the cost of the miles to the bonus to find the total cost for the year. So, $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800.

Therefore, the total amount John pays a year for driving is $31,800."
"To find out how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to add the time he exercised on Monday and Sunday. On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes, and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. So, we add these two times together:

\[ 16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes} \]

Peter wants to exercise for twice this amount of time on Tuesday. So, we multiply 39 by 2:

\[ 39 \times 2 = 78 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday. The correct answer is:

"To figure out how many pieces of paper are needed for a 32-page tabloid, let's think about how we fold the paper and print the pages.

When you fold a piece of paper vertically, you get two layers. Each layer can print two pages: one on the front and one on the back. So, each piece of paper can print 4 pages.

Now, we have a 32-page tabloid. To find out how many pieces of paper we need, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages each piece of paper can print:

\[
\frac{32 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ pages per piece of paper}} = 8 \text{ pieces of paper}
\]

So, we need 8 pieces of paper to make a 32-page tabloid.

The final answer is 8 pieces of paper."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Annika started with $50. She spent half of it on food and snacks. Half of $50 is $25. So, she spent $25 on food and snacks.

After spending $25, she had:
\[ 50 - 25 = 25 \text{ dollars left} \]

Then, she spent an additional $10 on rides. So, we subtract $10 from the $25 she had left:
\[ 25 - 10 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money left with Annika is $15.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Elise has 250 books in total. At the end of the year, she has 50 books left unsold, so she sold 200 books that year.

She sold 45 books this year, and in the first year, she sold twice as many as this year, so she sold \(2 \times 45 = 90\) books in the first year.

Now, to find out how much money she earned in the second year, we need to know how many books she sold in that year. We know she sold 45 books in the second year.

Each book sells for $20, so the total money she earned in the second year is:
\[ 45 \text{ books} \times \$20 \text{ per book} = \$900 \]

So, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $900. The answer is $900."
"To find out how much Watson made in April, we need to calculate his earnings from his hourly wage and his weekly bonus.

First, let's calculate his daily earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]

Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 5 days a week.
- He earns $100 per day.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since the company performed very well, Watson gets a $300 bonus each week. So, we add the bonus to his weekly earnings.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings with bonus} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Now, we need to determine how many weeks are in April. April typically has 30 days, and since he works 5 days a week, we can calculate the number of full weeks in April.

\[ \text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} \approx 4.29 \]

Since we are only counting full weeks, we consider 4 full weeks in April.

\[ \text{Total earnings for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 800 \, \text{\$/week} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Since the company performed very well for the whole month, Watson also receives the $300 bonus for each of the 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total bonus for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 1200 \, \text{\$} \]

Finally, we add his total earnings from his hourly wage and the total bonus to find his total earnings for April.

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 3200 \, \text{\$} + 1200 \, \text{\$} = 4400 \, \text{\$} \]

So, the total amount of money Watson made in April is:

\[ \boxed{4400} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

John plays arm wrestling with 20 people. He wins 80% of the matches. To find out how many people he beat, we calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

So, John beat 16 people. Since he played against 20 people in total, the number of people he lost to is:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people. The answer is 4."
"Okay, let me walk you through this step by step.

The bakery makes 60 loaves of bread each day. In the morning, they sell two-thirds of these loaves. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

After the morning, the bakery has:

\[
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves left}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, they sell half of the remaining loaves. So, we find half of the 20 loaves:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

So, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is 10. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. So, to find out how much Joey loses in one week, we divide 8 pounds by 4 weeks:

\[ 8 \text{ pounds} \div 4 \text{ weeks} = 2 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Now, Sandy needs to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, which is 2 pounds. Since Joey takes 4 weeks to lose 8 pounds, we need to figure out how long it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds at the same rate.

If Joey loses 2 pounds in 1 week, then Sandy, who is losing at the same rate, will also lose 2 pounds in 1 week. So, it will take Sandy 1 week to lose 2 pounds.

Therefore, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To find out how much you save, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the ice cream:
- The original price of one tub of ice cream is $13.
- The discounted price of one tub of ice cream is $11.
- So, you save $13 - $11 = $2 on one tub of ice cream.

Since you're buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's look at the milk:
- The discount on one packet of milk is $0.5.
- So, you save $0.5 on one packet of milk.

Since you're buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- $0.5 * 4 = $2

Now, to find the total savings, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk:
- Total savings = $4 + $2 = $6

So, the total amount you will save is $6."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The serum makes a person grow an extra arm every 3 days. We need to find out how many times 3 days fit into 15 days:
\[ \frac{15}{3} = 5 \]
So, the person grows 5 extra arms in 15 days.

Next, the serum makes a person grow an extra leg every 5 days. We need to find out how many times 5 days fit into 15 days:
\[ \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]
So, the person grows 3 extra legs in 15 days.

To find the total number of new limbs, we add the extra arms and extra legs together:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \]

So, after 15 days, the person will have grown 8 new limbs. The final answer is 8."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we calculate the cost of the business suits:
\[ 6 \text{ suits} \times \$100 \text{ per suit} = \$600 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the suitcases:
\[ 3 \text{ suitcases} \times \$50 \text{ per suitcase} = \$150 \]

Now, we find the cost of the flight ticket. The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. Since a business suit costs $100, we have:
\[ 5 \times \$100 = \$500 \]
\[ \$500 + \$700 = \$1200 \]

Adding up the costs of the business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket:
\[ \$600 + \$150 + \$1200 = \$1950 \]

The total amount Theo has for the trip is $6000. He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so the amount he can spend on other items is:
\[ \$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000 \]

Subtracting the cost of the business suits, suitcases, and flight ticket from the total amount he can spend:
\[ \$4000 - \$1950 = \$2050 \]

So, Theo has to spend $2050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2050} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have a family of 5 people. Three of them eat 3 eggs each day, and the other two eat 2 eggs each day.

First, let's find out how many eggs the three people eat in a day:
- Each of the three people eats 3 eggs, so together they eat \(3 \times 3 = 9\) eggs.

Next, let's find out how many eggs the other two people eat in a day:
- Each of the two people eats 2 eggs, so together they eat \(2 \times 2 = 4\) eggs.

Now, let's add these together to find out how many eggs the whole family eats in a day:
- Total eggs per day = Eggs eaten by the three people + Eggs eaten by the two people
- Total eggs per day = \(9 + 4 = 13\) eggs.

Since they eat eggs every day, to find out how many eggs they eat in a week (7 days), we multiply the daily total by 7:
- Total eggs per week = Total eggs per day \(\times\) 7
- Total eggs per week = \(13 \times 7 = 91\) eggs.

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week. The correct answer is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

We know that Quinn is 30 years old. 

Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, so we calculate Jane's age as:
\[ \text{Jane's age} = 30 - 3 = 27 \]

Trent is 5 years older than Jane, so we calculate Trent's age as:
\[ \text{Trent's age} = 27 + 5 = 32 \]

So, Trent is 32 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We know Cera is 46 years old now. Six years ago, she was 40 years old. At that time, Noah was half her age, so Noah was 20 years old.

Now, let's find out how old Noah is now. Since 6 years have passed, Noah is 20 + 6 = 26 years old now.

Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now. Also, it was 3000 times Noah's age at that time. So, six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 * 20 = 60000.

Since this 60000 is half of the current population, the current population of Chile is 60000 * 2 = 120000.

But we know this 60000 is actually half of the current population, so the current population is 120000 * 2 = 240000.

So, the population of Chile now is 240000. The correct answer is:

\boxed{240000}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total number of players on the team is 105. We also know that the number of players on the offense is twice the number on the defense, and the number of players on the special teams is half the number on the defense.

Let's say the number of players on the defense is \( D \). Then:
- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

Adding these together gives us the total number of players:
\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To make it easier to add, let's convert everything to have a common denominator:
\[ 2D = \frac{4D}{2} \]
So the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{4D + 2D + D}{2} = 105 \]
\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then we divide both sides by 7:
\[ D = 30 \]

So, the number of players on the defense is 30. The correct answer is 30."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 people.
She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so that's 3 * 4 = 12 people.

So, the total number of people invited is 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Now, 8 people couldn't come because they were sick. And 1/4 of that number had previous commitments. So, 1/4 of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2 people.

That means in total, 8 + 2 = 10 people couldn't come to the party.

So, the number of people who showed up is 24 - 10 = 14 people.

Therefore, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is 14."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna. He also got 2/5 times as many marbles from his father. First, we need to find out how many marbles his father gave him:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

So, his father gave him 8 marbles. Now, we add the marbles he bought to the ones his father gave him:

\[
20 + 8 = 28
\]

Each marble weighs 2 kg. To find the total weight of all the marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble:

\[
28 \times 2 = 56 \text{ kg}
\]

So, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has is 56 kg. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"To find out how much it costs to fill the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) is given by:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

The pool's dimensions are:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Height (depth) = 5 feet

So, we calculate the volume:

\[ V = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it costs $0.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool. To find the total cost, we multiply the volume by the cost per cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 120 \times 0.1 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $12. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know there are 30 boys in the classroom. The problem tells us there are 3 times as many girls as boys. So, we can calculate the number of girls by multiplying the number of boys by 3:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, the problem says there are 1/10 as many nongendered children as there are boys. So, we can find the number of nongendered children by dividing the number of boys by 10:

\[ \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{30}{10} = 3 \]

Now, to find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children together:

\[ \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123 \]

So, the total number of children in the classroom is 123."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means for every 1 pole, there are 3 wires. If we have 45 wires, we can find out how many poles we need by dividing the number of wires by 3.

So, we do:
\[ \text{Number of poles} = \frac{\text{Number of wires}}{3} = \frac{45}{3} = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial number of people:**
   - Men: 25
   - Women: 15
   - Total people initially: \(25 + 15 = 40\)

2. **After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left:**
   - Number of people who left: \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\)
   - Number of people remaining: \(40 - 10 = 30\)

3. **Given that 22 men stayed at the party:**
   - Number of men who left: \(25 - 22 = 3\)
   - Number of women who left: \(10 - 3 = 7\) (since 10 people left in total and 3 were men, the rest must be women)

4. **Number of women remaining:**
   - Initial number of women: 15
   - Number of women who left: 7
   - Number of women remaining: \(15 - 7 = 8\)

So, the number of women left at the party is 8. The correct answer is 8."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the book costs $4. The magazine costs half as much as the book, so we calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:
\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Now, the pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so we subtract $1 from the cost of the magazine to find the cost of the pen:
\[ \text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the pen costs $1. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Jam has a total of 26 pencils, which include 3 boxes of pencils and 2 loose pencils. So, if we let \( x \) be the number of pencils in each box, we can write the equation:
\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 3x = 26 - 2 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Now, we calculate the total number of pencils Jam has:
\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \]

Meg has 46 pencils. To find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have together:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \]

Now, we need to find out how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils, with each box holding 8 pencils:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To figure out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we need to consider two things: the cooling effect and the addition of cream.

First, let's look at the cooling. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. So, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Now, we need to consider the cream. Adding 15 milliliters of cream doesn't change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters weaker. It just adds more liquid to the cup.

So, the total reduction in milliliters weaker is just from the cooling:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. If 5 people leave with 7 new records, we need to figure out how many old records they brought in originally.

Since 2 old records trade for 1 new record, to get 7 new records, we need:
\[ 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records per new record} = 14 \text{ old records} \]

So, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the company has 100 employees in total. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. So, we calculate the number of junior programmers:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

This means there are 40 junior programmers. The rest of the employees are senior programmers:

\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

The salary for each junior programmer is $2000. So, the total salary for all junior programmers is:

\[ 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

The senior programmers are paid $400 more than the junior programmers, so their salary is:

\[ 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

The total salary for all senior programmers is:

\[ 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Now, to find the total amount the company pays to all programmers, we add the total salaries of junior and senior programmers:

\[ 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224000. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We start with \( x \) people on the bus at the terminal. At the first stop, 5 more people get on, so the bus now has \( x + 5 \) people.

At the second stop, 7 people get off and 8 more get on. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

We know that after the second stop, there are 20 people on the bus. So we can set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

So, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is 14. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{14}

"Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

So, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

The final answer is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we need to calculate the remaining percentage of charging required. The phone needs to charge from 60% to 100%, which means it needs to charge an additional 40%.

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point every 3 minutes. So, to charge 40 percentage points, we multiply 40 by 3 minutes:

\[
40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to convert 120 minutes into hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 120 by 60:

\[
120 \div 60 = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mom gives her 10 more, so she has:

\[ 7 + 10 = 17 \text{ lollipops} \]

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to her friend. So, the number of lollipops she has left is:

\[ 17 - 3 = 14 \text{ lollipops} \]

The final answer is 14."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for this shopping trip.

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80.
   - For every $20 spent, they get $1 off their next purchase.
   - So, the rewards earned are $80 / $20 = 4 rewards.
   
2. **Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip:**
   - They used 4 rewards on this trip.
   - Each reward is worth $1 off the next purchase.
   
3. **Calculate the discount from the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.
   - So, the discount from the coupon is 2 * 4 = $8.
   
4. **Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon:**
   - The customer spent $43 on this trip.
   - After using the rewards, the price becomes $43 - $4 = $39.
   - Then, applying the coupon discount, the price becomes $39 - $8 = $31.
   
So, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip. The final answer is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Job A and Job B to see who pays more after taxes.

For Job A:
- Nick works 2000 hours a year at $15 per hour.
- So, his total pay before tax is $15 * 2000 = $30,000.
- The state tax is 20% of $30,000, which is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000.
- So, his net pay after tax is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

For Job B:
- Nick gets $42,000 a year.
- But there's a $6,000 property tax, so his net income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
- Then, the state tax is 10% of $36,000, which is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600.
- So, his net pay after all taxes is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, to find out how much more money Nick makes at the job with the higher net pay, we subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B:
- $32,400 (Job B) - $24,000 (Job A) = $8,400.

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay. The answer is $8,400."
"To find out how many unmanned ruined castles there are in Scotland, we can break it down step by step:

1. First, we need to find out how many castles are ruined. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruined.
   - 40 percent of 220 is calculated as \(0.40 \times 220 = 88\).
   - So, there are 88 ruined castles.

2. Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned.
   - Half of 88 is calculated as \(0.50 \times 88 = 44\).
   - So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles.

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44.

The correct answer is 44."
"To find the cost difference between the two offers, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Furniture United's offer:
- They ask for an advance payment of $1,350.
- They also ask for 6 monthly installments of $350 each.

To find the total amount for the installments:
\[ 6 \times 350 = 2100 \]

Now, add the advance payment to the total installments:
\[ 1350 + 2100 = 3450 \]

So, the total cost for Furniture United's offer is $3,450.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer:
- They ask for an advance payment of $1,100.
- They also ask for 9 monthly installments of $250 each.

To find the total amount for the installments:
\[ 9 \times 250 = 2250 \]

Now, add the advance payment to the total installments:
\[ 1100 + 2250 = 3350 \]

So, the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer is $3,350.

Now, to find the cost difference between the two offers:
\[ 3450 - 3350 = 100 \]

The cost difference is $100.

So, the final answer is:

We have four people: Nick, Richard, Jason (DJ), and RJ. We need to find out how many guns each person would have if they share their guns equally.

First, let's add up all the guns they have:
- DJ has 8 guns.
- Nick has 10 guns.
- RJ has 1 gun.
- Richard has 5 guns.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
\[ 8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \]

So, they have a total of 24 guns. Now, we need to share these 24 guns equally among the 4 people. To do this, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people:
\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

So, if they share the guns equally, each person would have 6 guns.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how much sugar Mason needs, we need to add up the sugar required for the suckers and the fudge.

First, let's calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:
- Each batch of suckers needs 30 ounces of sugar.
- Mason wants to make 8 batches of suckers.

So, the total sugar for the suckers is:
\[ 8 \text{ batches} \times 30 \text{ ounces per batch} = 240 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, let's calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:
- Each batch of fudge needs 70 ounces of sugar.
- Mason wants to make 1 batch of fudge.

So, the total sugar for the fudge is:
\[ 1 \text{ batch} \times 70 \text{ ounces per batch} = 70 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together:
\[ 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces} \]

So, Mason needs a total of 310 ounces of sugar. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{310}
\]"
"Okay, let me walk you through this step-by-step:

Maria buys 8 shares of a stock at $8 each. So, the total cost is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$8/\text{share} = \$64 \]

In the first year, the price of the stock increases by 50%. So, the new price is:
\[ \$8 + 50\% \times \$8 = \$8 + \$4 = \$12 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at $12 each. The total value after the first year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$12/\text{share} = \$96 \]

In the second year, the price decreases by 25%. So, the new price is:
\[ \$12 - 25\% \times \$12 = \$12 - \$3 = \$9 \]

Now, Maria has 8 shares at $9 each. The total value after the second year is:
\[ 8 \text{ shares} \times \$9/\text{share} = \$72 \]

So, the final value of all Maria's shares is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Luke ate 2 hot dogs.

Thomas ate three times more than Luke, so:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]
Thomas ate 6 hot dogs.

John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
John ate 3 hot dogs.

Now, to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:
\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \]

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have a class of 200 students split into 3 groups. Two of these groups are equal in size, and the third group is 10 students smaller than each of the other two groups.

Let's say each of the two equal groups has \( x \) students. So, the third group will have \( x - 10 \) students.

The total number of students is the sum of the students in all three groups:
\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:
\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[ x = 70 \]

So, each of the two equal groups has 70 students. The third group, which is 10 students smaller, will have:
\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]"
"Farmer Brown has 60 animals in total, and he has twice as many chickens as cows. Let's figure out how many cows and chickens he has.

If we let the number of cows be \( C \), then the number of chickens is \( 2C \) because he has twice as many chickens as cows. The total number of animals is the sum of cows and chickens, so:

\[ C + 2C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Farmer Brown has 20 cows. Since he has twice as many chickens, he has:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
chickens.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs. Each cow has 4 legs, and each chicken has 2 legs. So, the total number of legs is:

\[ 4 \times 20 + 2 \times 40 = 80 + 80 = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have is 160. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Josh starts with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he adds \(4 \times 1 = 4\) balls. So, he has \(3 + 4 = 7\) balls in total.

But when he walks on stage, he drops 3 balls. So, he loses 3 balls, which means he has \(7 - 3 = 4\) balls left.

Therefore, with a sigh, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 4 balls.

The number of balls Josh has left to juggle is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with the weights of each animal:

1. The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
2. The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it's also 50 pounds.
3. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it's also 50 pounds.
4. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it's 50 + 10 = 60 pounds.
5. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it's 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
6. The container itself weighs 20 pounds.

Now, to find the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal, we add up all these weights:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Container: 20 pounds

Adding these together:
50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 260 pounds

So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds."
"Okay, let me break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits. That's the first part.

Next, at her baby shower, she got twice as many outfits as her friend gave her. So, we calculate:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \]
This means she got 48 outfits from her baby shower.

Then, her mom gave her 15 more outfits.

Now, we add all these together:
\[ 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 \]

So, the total number of baby outfits Laurel has is 87.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{87} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Tyson usually runs 5000 meters a day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters each day. So, we first find out how much more he should run:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters} \]

So, Tyson should run an extra 1000 meters each day. That means he should run:

\[ 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters} \]

Now, if Tyson runs 6000 meters every day for a month (30 days), the total distance he runs in June is:

\[ 6000 \times 30 = 180000 \text{ meters} \]

So, the total distance Tyson covered in June is 180000 meters. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{180000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We know the cost of Juice Box A is 4 dollars. 

- Juice Box B costs 5 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
  \[
  \text{Cost of Juice Box B} = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- Juice Box C costs 7 dollars more than Juice Box A, so:
  \[
  \text{Cost of Juice Box C} = 4 + 7 = 11 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, to find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:
\[
\text{Difference} = 11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Juice Box C costs 2 dollars more than Juice Box B. The final answer is 2 dollars."
"To find the total number of legs on all the tables in the restaurant, we need to add the legs from the tables with 4 legs and the tables with 3 legs.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs from the 40 tables that have 4 legs each:
\[ 40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of legs from the 50 tables that have 3 legs each:
\[ 50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 150 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we add these two totals together to get the total number of legs on all the tables:
\[ 160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs} \]

So, the total number of legs the restaurant's tables have is 310."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Jenny buys 36 cookies a week. She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week, so that's 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so that's 1 * 7 = 7 cookies.

Now, we subtract the cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box and the cookies her husband eats from the total number of cookies:

36 (total cookies) - 20 (cookies for son) - 7 (cookies for husband) = 9 cookies.

So, Jenny eats the remaining 9 cookies. The answer is 9."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30. So, the total cost without any discount would be:

\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, there's a 40% discount on these shirts. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 40% of $60:

\[ 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much Davos actually paid, we subtract the discount from the original total:

\[ 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

When they made tractors, they sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor. So, their daily revenue was:
\[ 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

Now, they make silos and sell 5 silos a day for $220 each. So, their daily revenue is:
\[ 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

To find out what percentage more they are making now, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New daily revenue} - \text{Old daily revenue}}{\text{Old daily revenue}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\$1100 - \$1000}{\$1000} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{\$100}{\$1000} \right) \times 100\% = 0.1 \times 100\% = 10\% \]

So, they are making 10% more per day now. The answer is 10%."
"To find out how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to add up the costs for food, treats, and medicine and then multiply by the number of months in a year.

First, let's calculate the monthly cost:
- Food costs $25 per week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly cost of food is \(25 \times 4 = 100\) dollars.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.

Now, let's add these up to get the total monthly cost:
\[100 \text{ (food)} + 20 \text{ (treats)} + 100 \text{ (medicine)} = 220 \text{ dollars per month}\]

Next, we need to find out the total cost for a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12:
\[220 \text{ dollars per month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 2640 \text{ dollars per year}\]

So, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year. The correct answer is 2640."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

- Monday's yoga class is 1 hour.
- Tuesday's cooking class is three times as long as Monday's yoga, so that's \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Wednesday's cheese-tasting event is 0.5 hours.
- Thursday's museum tour is half the length of the cooking class, so that's \(3 / 2 = 1.5\) hours.
- Friday's errands are 2 hours.

Now, let's add them all up:
\[1 \text{ (Monday)} + 3 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 0.5 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 1.5 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Friday)} = 1 + 3 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 \text{ hours}\]

So, the total number of hours for all Peyton’s after-work activities is 7.5 hours. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{7.5}

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

April needs 30 plant pots for daisies and twice as many for roses, which means she needs 60 plant pots for roses. So, in total, she needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots.

April already bought 100 plant pots from the garden center. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots she needs from the number she bought. So, 100 - 90 = 10 plant pots left over.

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is 10.

The final answer is 10."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Andrea started with $36. She spent some money on a sweater that cost $11 and gave $4 to her brother. So, the total amount she spent is $11 + $4 = $15.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the total amount she spent from the money she started with. So, $36 - $15 = $21.

Therefore, Andrea saved $21.

The final answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know John spends 6 hours boating. He spends half that time swimming, so he swims for:
\[ 6 \div 2 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

He also watches 3 different shows, each 2 hours long, so he spends:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these together, the total time he spends on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours is 30% of the total time he spent. To find the total time \( T \), we use the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we know that 40% of his total time is spent sightseeing. So, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

So, the time John spent sightseeing is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, Annabelle already has $80 saved up.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour and works for 20 hours. So, she earns:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour and works for 15 hours. So, she earns:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, let's add all the money she has:
\[ 80 + 200 + 75 = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400. To find out how much more she needs, we subtract the money she has from the cost of the phone:
\[ 400 - 355 = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, Annabelle still needs to save **45 dollars**."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the shortest tree is 6 feet tall. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:
\[ 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet} \]

The tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. First, we find the combined height of the shortest and the second tree:
\[ 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet} \]

Now, the height of the tallest tree is twice this combined height:
\[ 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{34}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Dean's mother gave him $28.
2. He bought 6 toy cars at $2 each, so the cost is \(6 \times 2 = \$12\).
3. He also bought 5 teddy bears at $1 each, so the cost is \(5 \times 1 = \$5\).
4. The total cost of the toys is \(12 + 5 = \$17\).
5. After buying the toys, Dean has \(28 - 17 = \$11\).

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Morgan has a budget of $90 for her birthday party. She wants to spend $5 on mini-golf, $5 on arcade tokens, and $20 on go-karts (since she wants to ride them twice). 

First, let's add up the costs of these activities:
- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-karts: $10 * 2 = $20

So, the total cost for these activities is:
\[ 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \]

Now, we subtract this total from her budget to find out how much money is left for her friends:
\[ 90 - 30 = 60 \]

With the remaining $60, she can buy go-kart rides for her friends. Since each go-kart ride costs $10, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one ride:
\[ \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

So, Morgan can invite 6 friends to her party. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Marisa gets $5 every day from her parents. Each day, she buys 4 lollipops, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. So, we need to find out how much she spends on lollipops each day and then how much she saves.

First, let's see how much she spends on lollipops each day:
- Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops each day.
- So, 4 lollipops cost \(4 \times 25 = 100\) cents.
- Since 100 cents is the same as 1 dollar, she spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Now, we know she gets $5 every day and spends $1 on lollipops. So, the money she saves each day is:
\[ 5 - 1 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

If she saves $4 each day, then over 5 days, she saves:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days is $20."
"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

Billy starts with $10 and buys candy that costs $1.50 per pound. After buying the candy, he takes half of his change and spends it on gumballs, which cost $0.05 each. He buys 40 gumballs.

First, let's find out how much money Billy has left after buying the candy. If he spends half of his change on gumballs, and he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each, the total cost of the gumballs is:
\[ 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]

Since this $2 is half of his change, his total change is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Billy has $4 left after buying the candy. This $4 is the money he has left after spending $1.50 per pound on candy. To find out how many pounds of candy he bought, we use the total money he started with and subtract the cost of the candy:
\[ 10 - 4 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ \text{Number of pounds of candy} = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know Carver is 45 years old, and that this is 5 years less than twice his son's age. So, if we let the son's age be \( x \), we can write the equation:
\[ 45 = 2x - 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first add 5 to both sides of the equation:
\[ 45 + 5 = 2x \]
\[ 50 = 2x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find out how many days the train goes between services, we need to calculate the total distance of one complete round trip and then see how many days it takes to cover 18,000 miles.

First, let's calculate the total distance of one complete round trip:
- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 125 miles (which is 50 miles less than 175 miles)

So, the total distance for one round trip is:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days}\]

To convert \(\frac{1}{20}\) of a day into hours, we know that \(\frac{1}{20} \times 24 = 1.2\) hours. Since we are asked for the number of days, and 1.2 hours is less than a full day, the train goes between services every 12 hours.

So, the train goes between services every 12 hours, which is equivalent to 1 day and 12 hours. However, the question asks for the number of days, and since 1.2 hours is less than a full day, the train goes between services every 12 hours, which is 1 day.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much stuffing a collie bed takes. A Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds, and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds. The collie bed takes the average of these two amounts:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds. Mark is making 4 chihuahua beds, and each chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the stuffing needed for the collie beds. Mark is making 3 collie beds, and each collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for 3 collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, John drives 200 miles to his friend's house at a speed of 70 mph. To find out how long this trip takes, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to get to his friend's house is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{20}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 2.857 \text{ hours} \]

Next, he takes a detour that adds 10 miles to his trip, making the total distance 210 miles. The time for this detour is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = \frac{210}{70} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

After getting to his friend's house, he drives home. The distance home is 240 miles, and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. The time for this trip is:

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = \frac{240}{80} \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add up all the times:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{to friend}} + \text{Time}_{\text{detour}} + \text{Time}_{\text{back home}} = \frac{20}{7} + 3 + 3 \]

To add these times together, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 7 and 1 is 7:

\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]
\[ 3 = \frac{21}{7} \]

So,

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{20}{7} + \frac{21}{7} + \frac{21}{7} = \frac{20 + 21 + 21}{7} = \frac{62}{7} \text{ hours} \approx 8.857 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time for the trip is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{62}{7}} \]"
"To find out how many boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we start by determining the number of boys. There are 96 fourth-graders in total, and 43 of them are girls. So, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls were absent, so the number of girls present is:

\[ 43 - 5 = 38 \]

Since the total number of fourth-graders is 96, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 96 - 38 = 58 - 4 = 54 \]

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

\[ 54 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way. If there are 6 girls in the park and there are twice as many boys, that means there are 12 boys. To find out the total number of kids, we add the number of girls and boys together. So, 6 girls plus 12 boys equals 18 kids in total. 

So, the total number of kids in the park is 18."
"To figure out the minimum score Jane needs on her third test, we start by adding the points she scored on her first two tests. She got 15 points on the first test and 18 points on the second test. So, let's add those up:

\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. To find out how many more points she needs, we subtract the points she already has from the total points required:

\[ 42 - 33 = 9 \]

So, Jane needs to score at least 9 points on her third test to pass. Therefore, the minimum number of points she must score on the third test is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 3 customers were kicked out for not wearing masks. So, \( x = 3 \).

Next, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of those for not wearing masks minus 5. So, we calculate:
\[ 4 \times 3 - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]
So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

Then, the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of those for shoplifting. So, we calculate:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]
So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

Now, we add up all the customers kicked out for these reasons:
\[ 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

Since the total number of customers kicked out is 50, we subtract the 31 from 50 to find out how many were kicked out for other reasons:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

So, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is 19. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Sara scored 8 points.
2. After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. So, we calculate three times Sara's score:
   \[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]
   This means Erin has 24 points after scoring 14 more.
3. To find out how many points Erin had before scoring the 14 points, we subtract the 14 points she scored from the 24 points she has now:
   \[ 24 - 14 = 10 \]

So, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find out how much will be spent on the senior gifts, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost, so the total cost per frame is $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

So, the total amount spent on the senior gifts is **$1198**."
"To find out how much Ethan would pay if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate the savings from the DIY option.

The original cost of the wallpaper is $400. The DIY option saves 20% of this cost. So, we first calculate 20% of $400:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } \$400 = 0.20 \times 400 = \$80 \]

This means Ethan saves $80 by making his own wallpaper. To find the total cost for Ethan, we subtract the savings from the original cost:

\[ \$400 - \$80 = \$320 \]

So, the total cost for Ethan if he makes his own hand-painted wallpaper is $320. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{320} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, they sold double the number of pairs sold on Friday, so:
\[ 14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs} \]

On Sunday, they sold half the number of pairs sold on Saturday, so:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ pairs} \]

Now, let's add up all the pairs sold over the three days:
\[ 14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 14 \text{ (Sunday)} = 56 \text{ pairs} \]

But on Sunday, 6 pairs were returned, so we need to subtract those from the total:
\[ 56 - 6 = 50 \text{ pairs} \]

So, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find out how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we need to add up the hours she practiced on each day she had practice.

- On Tuesdays, she practiced for 1 hour.
- On Thursdays, she practiced for 2 hours.
- On Saturdays, she practiced for twice as long as on Tuesdays, which means she practiced for \(2 \times 1 = 2\) hours.

Now, we add up all the hours:
\[1 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 2 \text{ (Thursday)} + 2 \text{ (Saturday)} = 5 \text{ hours}\]

So, Hallie had dance practice for a total of 5 hours a week. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{5}\)"
"To solve this problem, we need to find out how much the company spent on the functioning pieces of equipment after returning the faulty ones.

First, let's figure out how many pieces of equipment were faulty. The problem states that 40% of the total number of pieces were faulty. So, if the total number of pieces is \( N \), then the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the faulty pieces:
\[ N - 0.4N = 0.6N \]

The total cost of the equipment is $400,000. The cost of the functioning pieces is 60% of the total cost because 60% of the pieces are functioning. So, we calculate:
\[ 0.6 \times 400000 = 240000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money spent on the functioning pieces of equipment is $240,000.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240000}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mary has 30 sheep. Half of them, which is 15 sheep, give her 1 kg of milk each day. So, 15 sheep * 1 kg/sheep = 15 kg of milk from these sheep.

The other half, also 15 sheep, give her 2 kg of milk each day. So, 15 sheep * 2 kg/sheep = 30 kg of milk from these sheep.

Now, to find out the total milk she gets every day, we add the milk from both groups of sheep:
15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day. The answer is 45 kg."
"Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls, which is 12 rolls. She gave one roll to each of her 6 children, so that's 6 rolls used up. That leaves her with 12 - 6 = 6 rolls. Each of the remaining rolls was broken into 8 pieces, so she had 6 rolls * 8 pieces per roll = 48 pieces of rolls for the chickens. 

So, the number of pieces of rolls she fed to the chickens is 48. 

The correct answer is 48."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

We start with 40 pupils in the class.

1. Half of the class likes blue:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ pupils like blue}
   \]

2. After the 20 pupils who like blue are accounted for, we have:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ pupils remaining}
   \]

3. One-fourth of these remaining pupils like green:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pupils like green}
   \]

4. The rest of the pupils like yellow. So, we subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15 \text{ pupils like yellow}
   \]

Therefore, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is 15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

On Monday, Lucy sold all the apples she picked and got $56 from selling them at $4 per apple. To find out how many apples she sold, we divide the total money she got by the price per apple:

\[ \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, so:

\[ \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples} \]

Now, to find out how many apples she picked in total over the three days, we add the apples picked on each day:

\[ \text{Total number of apples picked} = 14 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 24 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 50 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is 50. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Lindsay started with 50 socks. She washed 10 pairs of socks, which means she washed 10 * 2 = 20 socks from the pairs. She also washed 15 loose socks. So, the total number of socks she washed is 20 + 15 = 35 socks. To find out how many socks she missed, we subtract the number of socks she washed from the total number of socks she started with: 50 - 35 = 15 socks. So, Lindsay missed 15 socks. The correct answer is:

\boxed{15}"
"Rachel originally had 23 cookies. Janet gave her 42 more cookies, so she had:

\[ 23 + 42 = 65 \]

cookies in total. Then her brother ate 44 of those cookies, so the number of cookies left is:

\[ 65 - 44 = 21 \]

So, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 21. 

The correct answer is 21."
"To find out how much Karan has to pay each month, we first need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest. The interest rate is 10%, and she borrowed $3,650 for five months.

The formula to calculate the total amount is:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{Number of Months}} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5884.4115 \]

Now, to find out how much she has to pay each month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5884.4115}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.8823 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.88 \]

So, Karan has to pay $1176.88 each month. The closest option to this amount is $1176.88.

The final answer is:
\[ 1176.88 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for Cho and Chloe's hiking distances.

First, we calculate how far Cho hiked:
- Cho's speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time Cho hiked: 8 hours

To find the distance, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for Cho:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

Next, we calculate how far Chloe hiked:
- Chloe's speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time Chloe hiked: 5 hours

Using the same formula:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

So, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. The final answer is:
\[ 67 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos. His friend Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, so Anna has \(2 \times 50 = 100\) silver pesos. Anna also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so Anna has \(80 + 40 = 120\) gold pesos.

Now, let's add up all the silver pesos they have together:
\[50 \text{ (Axel's silver pesos)} + 100 \text{ (Anna's silver pesos)} = 150 \text{ silver pesos}\]

And let's add up all the gold pesos they have together:
\[80 \text{ (Axel's gold pesos)} + 120 \text{ (Anna's gold pesos)} = 200 \text{ gold pesos}\]

So, the total number of pesos they have together is:
\[150 \text{ (silver pesos)} + 200 \text{ (gold pesos)} = 350 \text{ pesos}\]

Therefore, the total number of pesos they have together is 350."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, Millie buys supplies for $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups, so she can make:
\[ 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups} \]

She sells each cup for $1, so if she sells all 36 cups, she makes:
\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Now, she spends $18 to make the lemonade, so her profit from selling all the lemonade is:
\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

She sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups, we divide the total cups by the cups sold per hour:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

To find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours:
\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2/\text{hour} \]

So, the profit Millie makes per hour is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, so he has 2/5 of his land left. We're told that 2/5 of his land is 12.8 hectares. We need to find out how much land he had originally.

Let's set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{5}\), which is \(\frac{5}{2}\):
\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Now, let's do the multiplication:
\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

To make it easier, we can think of 12.8 as 128/10, so:
\[ x = \frac{128}{10} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{128 \times 5}{10 \times 2} = \frac{640}{20} = 32 \]

So, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land originally.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The choir has 52 members in total. Since 50% are boys and 50% are girls, we can find the number of girls by dividing the total number of members by 2:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
\]

So, there are 26 girls in the choir. The choir decides to perform only with the girls, so we focus on the girls.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. So, we need to find half of 26:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

This means 13 girls can't perform. So, the number of girls who can perform is:

\[
\text{Number of girls who can perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
\]

On the day of the performance, the 3 teachers decide to join them. So, we add the 3 teachers to the 13 girls who can perform:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 13 + 3 = 16
\]

Therefore, the total number of people who sang in the performance is 16. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

First, let's add up all the test scores:
\[ 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 \]

Adding these step by step:
\[ 65 + 94 = 159 \]
\[ 159 + 81 = 240 \]
\[ 240 + 86 = 326 \]
\[ 326 + 74 = 400 \]

So, the total sum of the scores is 400.

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of tests (which is 5) to find the average:
\[ \frac{400}{5} = 80 \]

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"To find out how much 6 erasers and 8 pencils cost, we can break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers. Each eraser costs $2, and we have 6 erasers. So, we multiply the cost of one eraser by the number of erasers:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $3, and we have 8 pencils. So, we multiply the cost of one pencil by the number of pencils:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

Now, we add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \]

So, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36. 

If we need to choose this from a multiple-choice question, the correct answer would be:
\[ \text{36} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson. Now, he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu. So, we need to find out how many messages that is. 

To find out how many messages Mr. Yu gets, we do:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

So, Mr. Yu gets 22 messages. Now, to find the total number of messages James delivers, we add the messages to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu:
\[ 66 + 22 = 88 \]

So, the total number of messages James delivers is 88. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{88}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Dasha and David.

Dasha buys tickets to ride all 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. So, the cost for one ride is $2 * 2 = $4. For 9 rides, the total cost is $4 * 9 = $36.

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, and with that, he gets 9 rides for free. So, David's total cost is just the price of the bracelet, which is $30.

To find out how much money David saves, we subtract the cost David pays from the cost Dasha pays. So, $36 - $30 = $6.

Therefore, David saves $6.

The final answer is $6."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Monica has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. So, the total number of gifts she needs to wrap is:
\[ 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \]

She has 144 inches of ribbon to wrap all these gifts. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of gifts:
\[ \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift} \]

So, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the ratio of popsicles Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and together they have 165 popsicles.

First, let's say Betty has 5 parts and Sam has 6 parts. So, the total parts they have together is 5 + 6 = 11 parts.

Since the total number of popsicles is 165, each part is equal to \( \frac{165}{11} = 15 \) popsicles.

Now, Betty has 5 parts, so she has \( 5 \times 15 = 75 \) popsicles.

Sam has 6 parts, so he has \( 6 \times 15 = 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract Betty's popsicles from Sam's popsicles:

\( 90 - 75 = 15 \)

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money Tim saves.

First, we know that Tim used to have a cable package that cost $60 a month. Now, he's switching to streaming services. Let's look at the cost of these services:

- Netflix costs $10 a month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each, but he gets a 20% discount when he bundles them. So, the discount is $10 * 20% = $2 per month for each service. That means he saves $2 on Hulu and $2 on Disney Plus, so the total savings for both services is $2 + $2 = $4 per month.

So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together after the discount is $10 - $2 + $10 - $2 = $16 per month.

Now, the total cost for all the streaming services is $10 (Netflix) + $16 (Hulu and Disney Plus) = $26 per month.

To find out how much money Tim saves, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
$60 (cable package) - $26 (streaming services) = $34.

So, Tim saves $34 a month by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services. The answer is $34."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Carol spends 4 hours writing a song. That's the same as 4 times 60 minutes, which is 240 minutes.

She spends half that time recording it, so that's 240 minutes / 2 = 120 minutes.

She spends 90 minutes editing it.

Now, to find out the total time she spent, we add all these times together:
240 minutes (writing) + 120 minutes (recording) + 90 minutes (editing) = 450 minutes.

To find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100 \]

So, we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Then we multiply by 100:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\% \]

So, the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing is 20%.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20\%} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system with 6 rows and 6 columns. First, we need to find out how many slots there are in the shelving system. Since it has 6 rows and 6 columns, the total number of slots is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of these slots. So, we calculate double the number of slots:
\[ 2 \times 36 = 72 \]

Then, we add 20 to this number:
\[ 72 + 20 = 92 \]

So, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Erica made 20 cards. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of cards, and each box has 15 cards. So, her dad brought her \(2 \times 15 = 30\) cards. Adding the cards she made to the ones her dad brought, she had \(20 + 30 = 50\) cards in total.

Then, she gave out 24 cards to her classmates and received 17 cards from her family and friends. So, we need to subtract the 24 cards she gave out and add the 17 cards she received. That means \(50 - 24 + 17 = 43\).

So, Erica now has 43 Valentine's cards. The final answer is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Jenny has a pizza with 12 slices. She gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. To find out how many slices that is, we do:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Next, she gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. To find out how many slices that is, we do:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, Bill gets 4 slices and Mark gets 3 slices. That's a total of:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. So, the total number of slices given away and eaten is:
\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we subtract the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices to find out how many slices are left:
\[ 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices left is 3. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Mark has $50 in his bank account and he earns $10 each day. He needs $300 to buy a bike. To find out how many days he needs to save, we subtract the money he already has from the total cost of the bike:

\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for him to earn $250 if he earns $10 each day:

\[ 250 \div 10 = 25 \]

So, Mark needs to work for 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike. The answer is 25 days."
"Okay, let me break it down step by step for clarity.

Nancy saw 90 spiders. The number of millipedes is one-third the number of spiders, so:
\[ \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

Next, the number of stink bugs is twice the number of millipedes minus 12:
\[ \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 \]

Now, to find the total number of bugs, we add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:
\[ \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 \]

So, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We know Erica is 30 years old.

Beth is 5 years older than Erica, so Beth's age is:
\[ 30 + 5 = 35 \text{ years} \]

Alice is 7 years older than Beth, so Alice's age is:
\[ 35 + 7 = 42 \text{ years} \]

Now, to find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages:
\[ 42 - 30 = 12 \]

So, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces. So, the total number of ounces he drinks is:
\[ 8 \text{ ounces/glass} \times 2 \text{ glasses} = 16 \text{ ounces} \]

Now, we know that each ounce of milk has 3 calories. So, to find out how many calories are in 16 ounces, we multiply:
\[ 16 \text{ ounces} \times 3 \text{ calories/ounce} = 48 \text{ calories} \]

So, John consumed 48 calories. 

The final answer is:
\[ 48 \]"
"To find out how much the builder earns in a year, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many days the builder works in a month. He works 6 days a week and there are 4 weeks in a month, so:

\[ 6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days he works in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so:

\[ 24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year} \]

Now, we know he earns $50 every day. So, to find out his total earnings for the year, we multiply the number of days he works in a year by his daily earnings:

\[ 288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14400 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, the builder earns $14400 in a year. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{14400}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk. For a quadruple batch, we multiply these amounts by 4:

- Flour: \(3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}\)
- Milk: \(1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}\)

Next, we need to figure out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy. Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.

- For flour: \(12 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups/bag} = 6 \text{ bags}\)
- For milk: \(4 \text{ cups} \div 2 \text{ cups/bottle} = 2 \text{ bottles}\)

Now, we need to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy:

- Difference: \(6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4 \text{ bags}\)

So, Mark needs to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much energy the air conditioner uses in one day before and after the reduction.

1. **Energy used per day before reduction:**
   - The air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour.
   - Mel uses it for 8 hours a day.
   - So, the energy used per day is \(900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours}\).

2. **Energy used per day after reduction:**
   - Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, so he uses it for \(8 - 5 = 3\) hours a day.
   - The energy used per day now is \(900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours}\).

3. **Daily energy savings:**
   - The difference in energy used per day is \(7200 \, \text{watt-hours} - 2700 \, \text{watt-hours} = 4500 \, \text{watt-hours}\).

4. **Total energy savings in 30 days:**
   - Over 30 days, the total savings would be \(4500 \, \text{watt-hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135000 \, \text{watt-hours}\).

5. **Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours:**
   - Since \(1 \, \text{kilowatt-hour} = 1000 \, \text{watt-hours}\), the total savings in kilowatt-hours is \(\frac{135000 \, \text{watt-hours}}{1000} = 135 \, \text{kilowatt-hours}\).

So, the total kilowatt-hours of electric energy Mel will save in 30 days is \(\boxed{135}\)."
"To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to add up all the stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

Let's break it down:

- Two zebras with 17 stripes each: \(2 \times 17 = 34\)
- One zebra with 36 stripes: \(36\)
- One zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes: \(36 / 2 = 18\)

Now, let's add these together to get the total number of stripes:
\[34 + 36 + 18 = 88\]

There are 3 zebras in total. To find the average number of stripes, we divide the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
\[88 \div 3 = 29.33\]

So, the average number of stripes on the zebras is approximately 29.33. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{29.33}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Tyson wants to make muffaletta sandwiches for a big game. Each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and it serves 4 people. There are 20 people going to watch the game, so Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches to serve all of them.

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each sandwich serves:
\[ \frac{20 \text{ people}}{4 \text{ people per sandwich}} = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Next, we need to know how much meat and cheese Tyson will need. Since each sandwich needs 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, for 5 sandwiches, he will need:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of meat} \]
\[ 5 \text{ pounds of cheese} \]

Now, let's look at the cost of the meat and cheese:
- Meat costs $7.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 7 \text{ dollars per pound} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]
- Cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so for 5 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 5 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the total cost, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:
\[ 35 \text{ dollars} + 15 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Tyson will spend $50 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches for 20 people. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let's go through the problem again with a simpler explanation.

Allan initially has 40 cannolis. He buys 60 more, so he now has:
\[ 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis} \]

The problem also says there are twice as many corns as cannolis initially. So, the initial number of corns is:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns} \]

Then, Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he has now. Since he has 100 cannolis now, he buys:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns} \]

So, the total number of corns he has now is:
\[ 80 - 40 + 60 = 100 \text{ corns} \]

Now, we add the number of corns and cannolis he has:
\[ 100 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 200 \]

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already walked half of his steps on his way to and from school, which means he walked 5,000 steps. Then he went for a short walk with his friend and added another 1,000 steps. So, before his jog, he had walked a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.

Now, we know that after his jog, he still needs to walk 2,000 steps to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means he must have taken 10,000 - 6,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

So, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is 2,000. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{2000}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Toby's book is 45 pages long, and each page has 200 words. So, the total number of words in the book is:
\[ 45 \text{ pages} \times 200 \text{ words/page} = 9000 \text{ words} \]

Toby reads at a rate of 300 words per minute. To find out how long it takes him to read the entire book, we divide the total number of words by his reading speed:
\[ \frac{9000 \text{ words}}{300 \text{ words/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Toby needs to be at the airport in 60 minutes, and it takes him 10 minutes to get there. So, he needs to finish reading the book 50 minutes before he needs to leave the airport. Since it takes him 30 minutes to read the book, he will be:
\[ 50 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Toby will be 20 minutes early. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money the company paid in total for May and June.

### May:
- They hired 40 employees.
- Each employee worked 40 hours a week.
- May has 4 weeks.
- So, the total hours worked in May:
  \[
  40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 6400 \text{ hours}
  \]
- Each employee was paid $15 per hour.
- Total money paid in May:
  \[
  6400 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 96000 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### June:
- 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so 10 employees' contracts expired.
- That means 30 employees' contracts were still active.
- These 30 employees worked 40 hours a week.
- June has 4 weeks.
- So, the total hours worked by the remaining 30 employees in June:
  \[
  30 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/employee/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 4800 \text{ hours}
  \]
- Each employee was still paid $15 per hour.
- Total money paid in June:
  \[
  4800 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 72000 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Total for Both Months:
- Total money paid in May: $96000
- Total money paid in June: $72000
- Total money paid in both months:
  \[
  96000 \text{ dollars} + 72000 \text{ dollars} = 168000 \text{ dollars}
  \]

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is **$168000**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend. She bought 2 pounds of taffy. The taffy is on sale where you pay $3 for the first pound and $1.50 for the second pound. So, the total cost for the taffy is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, she bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets at $0.25 each. So, the cost for the seashells and magnets is:
\[ 1.50 + 4 \times 0.25 = 1.50 + 1.00 = 2.50 \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[ 4.50 + 2.50 = 7.00 \]

Sally started with $10, so the money she has left is:
\[ 10 - 7 = 3 \]

So, Sally has $3 left. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Tim buys two packs of fireworks. The first pack costs $400, and the second pack costs twice as much, so it costs $800. Adding these together, the total cost for the fireworks is:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

Tim gets a 20% discount on these fireworks. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 20% of $1200:

\[ 0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \]

So, the discount amount is $240. Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks:

\[ 1200 - 240 = 960 \]

Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. To find the total amount he spent, we add the discounted cost of the fireworks to the cost of the finale firework:

\[ 960 + 150 = 1110 \]

So, the total amount Tim spent is $1110. 

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{1110} \]"
"Shannon eats 2 madeleine cookies every night. Over 30 days, she will eat:

\[ 2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies} \]

Her recipe makes 12 cookies at a time. To find out how many dozen cookies she needs to make 60 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in a dozen:

\[ \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozen} \]

So, Shannon will need to make 5 dozen cookies to last her for 30 days. 

The correct answer is 5 dozen."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Marcy makes 50,000 candles. We know that 95% of these candles are safe and won't explode. So, the number of safe candles is:
\[ 95\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.95 \times 50000 = 47500 \]

This means the remaining 5% of the candles are dangerous and might explode. So, the number of dangerous candles is:
\[ 5\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500 \]

Out of these 2500 dangerous candles, 1% of them have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. So, the number of dangerous candles that smell like wet dog is:
\[ 1\% \text{ of } 2500 = 0.01 \times 2500 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 25. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Misha is buying 4 blouses that are 30% off. The regular price of each blouse is $20.

First, we need to find out how much the discount is for one blouse. A 30% discount on $20 is calculated as:
\[ 20 \times \frac{30}{100} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6 \]

So, the discount amount for one blouse is $6. This means the sale price of one blouse is:
\[ 20 - 6 = 14 \]

Now, Misha is buying 4 blouses, so we multiply the sale price of one blouse by 4:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Joanne gathers apples from three types of trees:
- From the tallest trees, she gathers 30 apples.
- From the shortest trees, she gathers half of what she gets from the tallest trees, so that's 30 / 2 = 15 apples.
- From the average trees, she gathers an unknown amount, which we'll call \( A_{\text{avg}} \).

Her sister gathers apples in the following amounts:
- From the tallest trees, she gathers twice as many as Joanne, so that's 2 * 30 = 60 apples.
- From the shortest trees, she gathers three times as many as Joanne, so that's 3 * 15 = 45 apples.
- From the average trees, she gathers 0 apples.

The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So, we can write the equation for the total apples gathered as:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Now, we solve for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

So, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this problem step by step.

We know there are 180 heads and 304 humps in the herd. Let's denote the number of camels as \( c \) and the number of dromedaries as \( d \).

Camels have 1 head and 2 humps, while dromedaries have 1 head and 1 hump.

From the information given:
1. The total number of heads is 180, so \( c + d = 180 \).
2. The total number of humps is 304, so \( 2c + d = 304 \).

We can solve these equations to find the values of \( c \) and \( d \).

First, let's subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( d \):
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now that we know \( c = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

So, the number of dromedaries is 56.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many kilometers Tom traveled in total.

First, we calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
- He traveled 200 kilometers each day for 4 days.
- So, \(200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}\).

Next, we find out how far he traveled in the next 2 days. He traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days:
- 30% of 800 km is \(0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}\).

Then, he didn't travel at all on the next day.

For the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers each day:
- So, \(300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}\).

Now, we add up all the distances:
- First 4 days: 800 km
- Next 2 days: 240 km
- Next day: 0 km
- Second week: 2100 km

So, the total distance is \(800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}\).

Therefore, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is \(\boxed{3140}\) kilometers."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, and it's \( \frac{1}{4} \) the size of Zack's locker. So, if we let the size of Zack's locker be \( Z \), then:
\[ \frac{Z}{4} = 5 \]

To find \( Z \), we multiply both sides by 4:
\[ Z = 5 \times 4 \]
\[ Z = 20 \]

Now, Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. So, if we let the size of Timothy's locker be \( T \), then:
\[ \frac{T}{2} = 20 \]

To find \( T \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ T = 20 \times 2 \]
\[ T = 40 \]

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches. The answer is 40."
"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb, we need to calculate the difference in elevation between where Stanley's comb is and where Oliver is standing.

Stanley's comb is at 10,000 feet.
Oliver is at 3,000 feet.

So, Oliver needs to climb:
\[ 10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 7,000 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Oliver must climb 7,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

The correct answer is:
\[ \text{7000 feet} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Mr. Josue got money from two places. The first place gave him $4000. The second place gave him twice as much as the first place, so that's $4000 times 2, which equals $8000.

Now, if we add the money from both places, we get:
\[ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 \]

Mr. Josue already had $5000 in his store. So, if we add the $12000 he got from the banks to his $5000, we get:
\[ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 \]

So, Mr. Josue now has $17000 in total. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{17000} \]"
"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats came and each boat carried away 5 cats. So, the total number of cats carried away is:

\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

After the boats carried away the cats, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Later, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse they saw. First, we calculate 3/5 of 30:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

So, 18 cats ran away. The number of cats left on the rock after some ran away is:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ 12 \]

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how much Bill has to pay for 2 years of the streaming service, we need to break it down into different parts based on the price changes.

First, let's look at the first 6 months:
- The cost is $8 per month.
- So, for 6 months, the cost is \(6 \times 8 = 48\) dollars.

Next, for the next 2 months (months 7 and 8):
- The cost is $12 per month.
- So, for 2 months, the cost is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.

Then, for the next 10 months (months 9 to 18):
- The cost is $14 per month.
- So, for 10 months, the cost is \(10 \times 14 = 140\) dollars.

Now, we add up all these costs:
- First 6 months: $48
- Next 2 months: $24
- Next 10 months: $140

Adding these together:
\[48 + 24 + 140 = 212\]

So, the total cost for 2 years of the service is $212. 

The final answer is \(\boxed{212}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Cole bought tattered jeans for $28 and jogger jeans for $6 less than that. So, the jogger jeans cost:
\[ 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Cole saved a total of $6, and he saved 1/3 of that from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. So, he saved:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
from the jogger jeans, and
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
from the tattered jeans.

The tattered jeans cost $28, and he saved $4 from them. So, the original cost of the tattered jeans was $28, and the jogger jeans cost $22. The difference in cost between the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to add up the capacity of all the vehicles they rented.

First, let's look at the buses. They rented 4 buses, and each bus can hold 60 employees. So, the total capacity for the buses is:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ employees} \]

Next, they rented 6 minibusses, and each minibus can hold 30 employees. So, the total capacity for the minibusses is:
\[ 6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ employees} \]

Then, they rented 10 minivans, and each minivan can hold 15 employees. So, the total capacity for the minivans is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ employees} \]

Now, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles:
\[ 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \text{ employees} \]

So, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is 570. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{570} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more from the store. So, she has 6 bird feeders in total.

Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds per day. So, 3 store-bought feeders will attract \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds per day.

Each of the bird feeders Lillian made herself attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds per day. So, 3 of her bird feeders will attract \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds per day.

Adding these together, the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day is \(60 + 90 = 150\).

So, the number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is 150."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the soup and cake costs first.

The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find out how much the soup costs, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to $4.

25% of $4 is:
\[ 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]

So, the soup costs:
\[ 4 + 1 = 5 \]

The cake costs half the price of the bagel. Since the bagel costs $4, the cake costs:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Now, to find out the total cost of the dinner, we add the cost of the bagel, the soup, and the cake:
\[ 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 \]

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kenny sells his Pokemon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100. He keeps 1/3 of his cards and has $50 left after buying the ticket. This means he spent $100 - $50 = $50 on the ticket.

If he spent $50 on the ticket and each card is sold for $1.5, we can find out how many cards he sold by dividing the total money he got from selling the cards by the price per card. So, the number of cards he sold is $50 / $1.5 = 33.33. Since he can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to 33 cards.

Now, since he sold 33 cards, and he kept 1/3 of his cards, that means the 33 cards he sold represent 2/3 of his total cards. So, if 33 cards are 2/3 of his total cards, we can find the total number of cards by setting up the equation:

\[ \frac{2}{3}x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{3}{2} \):

\[ x = 33 \times \frac{3}{2} = 33 \times 1.5 = 49.5 \]

Since the number of cards must be a whole number, and 49.5 is close to 49 but not exactly, we need to check if 49 cards would work. If he had 49 cards, then he would keep \( \frac{1}{3} \times 49 = 16.33 \) cards, which isn't a whole number. So, let's check 50 cards:

If he had 50 cards, he would keep \( \frac{1}{3} \times 50 = 16.67 \) cards, which isn't a whole number either. But if he had 49 cards, he would keep 16 cards, and he would sell 33 cards, which fits the condition.

So, the total number of cards he started with is 49.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{49} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

The caterer was supposed to prepare enough hot dogs for half of the 36 guests to have two hot dogs each. Half of 36 is 18, so 18 guests would have two hot dogs each, which means 18 x 2 = 36 hot dogs were prepared.

But when 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hot dog, there were only 36 hot dogs available. So, 40 - 36 = 4 hot dogs were left over, meaning 4 guests didn't get a second hot dog.

So, the number of guests who didn't get a second hot dog is 4.

The final answer is 4."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Indras has 6 letters in her name. To find out how many letters her sister's name has, we first need to find half of the letters in Indras' name. Half of 6 is 3. Then, we add 4 more letters to that number because her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of Indras' name. So, we do 3 + 4, which equals 7.

Now, to find the total number of letters in both names, we add the number of letters in Indras' name (6) to the number of letters in her sister's name (7). So, 6 + 7 equals 13.

Therefore, the total number of letters in Indras and her sister's names is 13. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{13}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

First, we need to find the total cost of all the items before any discount:
- The pot and pans cost $120.00.
- The mixing bowls cost $20.00.
- The utensils cost $5.00 each, and there are 5 of them, so that's $5.00 × 5 = $25.00.

Now, let's add these amounts together:
\[ 120.00 + 20.00 + 25.00 = 165.00 \]

Next, we need to calculate the discount. The items are 20% off, so we find 20% of $165.00:
\[ 0.20 \times 165.00 = 33.00 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 165.00 - 33.00 = 132.00 \]

So, the final amount Charlotte has to pay is $132.00.

The correct answer is: **$132.00**"
"To find out how much more money Dora needs, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. Adding these together gives:

\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

So, the total cost of the items is $19.

Next, we need to add up the money Dora has. She has $2 from her allowance and $16 from her mother. Adding these amounts together gives:

\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

So, Dora has $18 in total.

To find out how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total amount of money she has from the total cost of the items:

\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Prince Thaddeus killed 100 dragons.
2. Prince Arthur killed three quarters of what Prince Thaddeus killed. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]
   So, Prince Arthur killed 75 dragons.
3. Prince Walter killed twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150
   \]
   So, Prince Walter killed 150 dragons.
4. Prince Bruce killed one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter. So, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]
   So, Prince Bruce killed 30 dragons.

Therefore, the number of dragons Prince Bruce slew is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we have 15 gallons of gas divided into 5 containers. So, each container has:
\[ \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container. Since each container is 3 gallons, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we need to convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

So, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline. The final answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"Let's break down the problem again step by step to find out how many candy bars George bought.

1. **Total money George spent:** $5
2. **Money left after buying chips and candy bars:** 1% of $5 = $0.05

So, the money spent on chips and candy bars is:
\[ 5 - 0.05 = 4.95 \text{ dollars} \]

3. **Cost of chips:** Each bag of chips costs $0.40. George bought 3 bags of chips.
\[ 3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the money spent on candy bars is:
\[ 4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars} \]

4. **Cost of candy bars:** Each candy bar costs $0.75. To find out how many candy bars George bought, we divide the money spent on candy bars by the cost of one candy bar.
\[ \frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5 \]

Therefore, George bought 5 candy bars. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Ray had 25 lollipops and decided to keep 5 for himself. So, he shared the rest with his four friends. To find out how many lollipops he shared, we subtract the 5 he kept from the total 25:

\[ 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Now, Ray shared these 20 lollipops equally among his four friends. To find out how many lollipops each friend got, we divide 20 by 4:

\[ 20 \div 4 = 5 \]

So, each friend received 5 lollipops. The final answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"Rory made a cake that weighs 20 ounces. She cuts it into 8 pieces, so each piece is 20/8 = 2.5 ounces. Rory and her mom each have one piece, so together they have 2.5 + 2.5 = 5 ounces. The rest of the cake is 20 - 5 = 15 ounces. So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces. The answer is 15."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Sitti has 34 oranges, and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges they have together is:

\[ 34 + 22 = 56 \]

Now, Sitti and Juris are sharing these oranges with their 6 friends, which makes a total of 8 people (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person gets, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:

\[ \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

So, each person will get 7 oranges. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions, but he doubles that amount. So, he needs 4 pounds of onions. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound, so the cost for 4 pounds is:

\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00 \text{ per pound} = \$8.00 \]

Next, he needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00. So, the cost for 2 boxes is:

\[ 2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$4.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the onions and the beef stock:

\[ \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00 \]

The soup serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[ \frac{\$12.00}{6 \text{ servings}} = \$2.00 \text{ per serving} \]

So, the cost per serving is \$2.00. 

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Wayne takes 4 minutes to drive to the theater. The problem says that Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Time for Bernadette's drive} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, we subtract the time Wayne takes to drive from the time Bernadette takes:

\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave earlier} = 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we first need to determine the width of the room. We know the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now we can use the area formula to find the width:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ 98 \text{ feet} \]

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{98} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack has 20 beads.

So, the total number of beads Elizabeth bought is:
\[ 1 \times 20 + 2 \times 20 = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ beads} \]

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

So, the total number of beads Margareth bought is:
\[ 3 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ beads} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has compared to Elizabeth:
\[ 140 \text{ beads} - 60 \text{ beads} = 80 \text{ beads} \]

So, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Okay, let's go through the problem again step by step.

Initially, the house temperature is 40 degrees. Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees every hour. So, the temperature increase from the oven is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]
Adding this to the initial temperature:
\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. So, the number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes is:
\[ 30 \text{ minutes} \div 10 \text{ minutes/interval} = 3 \text{ intervals} \]
The total temperature decrease from the window is:
\[ 3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]
Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:
\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

So, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{49}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step for James' triathlon times.

First, we know Jon's total time for the triathlon is 170 minutes. James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon, so he takes 90% of Jon's swim time. Jon's swim time is 40 minutes, so James' swim time is:
\[ 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon. Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, so James' bike time is:
\[ 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Jon's total time is 170 minutes, and he won by 10 minutes, so James' total time is:
\[ 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

We already have James' swim and bike times, so we can find his run time by subtracting the swim and bike times from his total time:
\[ 180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[ \boxed{59} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 1.25 hours is:
\[ 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so:
\[ 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so:
\[ \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long. The final answer is 20 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Michael's horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour. If the horse runs for 30 minutes, which is half an hour, we can calculate the distance it runs by using the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, the distance the horse runs is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 32 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Now, for every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So, for 16 miles, the horse will eat:

\[ \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail per mile} = 8 \text{ bails} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times \$3 \text{ per bail} = \$24 \]

Michael has 6 five-dollar bills, which means he has:

\[ \text{Total money} = 6 \times \$5 = \$30 \]

After buying the hay, the change Michael has is:

\[ \text{Change} = \$30 - \$24 = \$6 \]

So, the change Michael has is \$6. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs and 2 loose eggs. First, let's find out the total number of eggs she has:

4 dozen eggs = 4 × 12 = 48 eggs
Adding the 2 loose eggs, she has 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs. So, the total number of glasses she can make is:
\[ \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses} \]

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays she can put out, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses each tray can hold:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays} \]

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog. The answer is:

"Okay, let me break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Initially, Joey has 214 points. He scores 26 more points, so his new total is:
\[ 214 + 26 = 240 \]

Marcy starts with 225 points and scores 10 more points, so her new total is:
\[ 225 + 10 = 235 \]

Now, to find out by how many points Joey is winning, we subtract Marcy's new score from Joey's new score:
\[ 240 - 235 = 5 \]

So, Joey is now winning by 5 points. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576. First, we need to find out how much each sneaker cost. We do this by dividing the total cost by the number of sneakers:

\[
\text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, the salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each on Monday. So, the money made from these sneakers is:

\[
17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
\]

After selling 17 sneakers, he had 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left. These were sold to a department store for $25 each. So, the money made from these sneakers is:

\[
31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the money made from both sales to find the total revenue:

\[
340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total cost of the sneakers was $576. So, the profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[
1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the salesman's profit is $539. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{539}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Beatrice bought crayons in two different types of packets. Six of the packets had 8 pieces each, and the other four packets had 16 pieces each.

First, we calculate the total number of crayons in the six packets with 8 pieces each:
\[ 6 \times 8 = 48 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of crayons in the four packets with 16 pieces each:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we add these two totals together to find the total number of crayons:
\[ 48 + 64 = 112 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 crayon pieces. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{112} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have two options:
1. The super ticket for $20 that includes a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra.
2. A movie ticket for $12 and then buying a popcorn and a soda at regular prices.

We know that by buying the super ticket, you save $2. So, if you didn't save $2, the cost would be the same. Let's figure out the cost of the popcorn and soda separately.

The super ticket costs $20, and it includes a popcorn and a soda for $1 extra. So, the cost of the popcorn and soda together is $19 (because $20 - $1 = $19).

Now, if you buy the movie ticket for $12 and then the popcorn and soda separately, the total cost would be $12 (for the movie ticket) + $P (for the popcorn) + $3 (for the soda). We know this total is $2 more than the super ticket, so:

\[ 12 + P + 3 = 22 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 15 + P = 22 \]

So,

\[ P = 22 - 15 \]
\[ P = 7 \]

But we know from the problem that you saved $2 by buying the super ticket, so the correct price of the popcorn and soda together is $19. Therefore, the price of the popcorn alone must be:

\[ 19 - 3 = 16 \]

But this doesn't match our earlier calculation. Let's recheck the problem statement and our logic. The correct way to solve it is:

\[ 12 + P + 3 = 20 - 2 \]
\[ 15 + P = 18 \]
\[ P = 18 - 15 \]
\[ P = 3 \]

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $3. 

The correct answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much it costs to fill one balloon after the price increase. Initially, it cost $900 for 20 balloons, so:

\[
\text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, the price increased by $20, so the new cost per balloon is:

\[
45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find out how much it would cost to fill 170 balloons at this new price:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
\]

To calculate \(170 \times 65\), we can break it down:

\[
170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
\]

First, calculate \(170 \times 60\):

\[
170 \times 60 = 10200
\]

Then, calculate \(170 \times 5\):

\[
170 \times 5 = 850
\]

Now, add these two results together:

\[
10200 + 850 = 11050
\]

So, the total cost for Bentley to fill 170 balloons after the price increase is:

\[
\boxed{11050}

"Sure, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

First, we need to find out how far the car traveled in each part of the trip.

1. For the first part of the trip, the car drove at 60 mph for 2 hours. So, the distance is:
   \[
   60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. For the second part, the car drove at 30 mph for 1 hour. So, the distance is:
   \[
   30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles}
   \]

Now, we add these distances to find the total distance:
\[
120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles}
\]

Next, we need to find the total time the car was traveling. The car drove for 2 hours at 60 mph and 1 hour at 30 mph, so the total time is:
\[
2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours}
\]

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph}
\]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is \( 50 \, \text{mph} \).

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Jenna starts with 8 sapphires. She trades 3 of them for 2 rubies. So, she has 5 sapphires left.

Each sapphire is worth $800, so the 5 sapphires are worth:
\[ 5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars} \]

For the rubies, she gets 2 rubies. Each ruby is worth $1200, so the 2 rubies are worth:
\[ 2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total value of all her jewels, we add the value of the sapphires and the rubies together:
\[ 4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total value of all her jewels is $6400. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{6400}

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can do the math step by step.

First, let's look at how many apples each person eats in one day. Both Marin and Nancy eat 4 apples each day.

Next, we need to find out how many apples they eat in 30 days. We do this by multiplying the number of apples each person eats in one day by 30.

For Marin:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

For Nancy:
\[ 4 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ apples} \]

Now, we add the apples eaten by both Marin and Nancy in 30 days:
\[ 120 \text{ apples} + 120 \text{ apples} = 240 \text{ apples} \]

So, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is 240. The correct answer is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much potting soil one raised bed needs. Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall. To find the volume, we multiply these three numbers together:

\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Bob has 10 raised beds, so we multiply the volume of one bed by 10 to find the total volume needed:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 32 \times 10 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet. To find out how many bags Bob needs, we divide the total volume by the volume each bag can hold:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag to find the total cost:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

So, the total cost for the potting soil is $1920. 

The correct answer is **$1920**."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We have 15 red cards. The number of green cards is 60% more than the red cards. So, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15 to find out how many green cards there are.

First, let's find out how many green cards there are:
\[ 60\% \text{ of } 15 = 0.60 \times 15 = 9 \]
So, the number of green cards is:
\[ 15 + 9 = 24 \]

Next, we know the number of yellow cards is the same as the sum of the red and green cards:
\[ 15 + 24 = 39 \]

Now, we add up all the cards:
\[ 15 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 39 \text{ (yellow)} = 78 \]

So, the total number of cards is 78. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{78} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down in a simpler way:

Initially, Katelyn saw 50 fairies. After 20 minutes, her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which is 25 fairies, and these joined the 50 fairies already there. So, the total number of fairies became:

\[ 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Then, 10 minutes later, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies remaining is:

\[ 75 - 30 = 45 \]

Therefore, the number of fairies remaining is 45.

The final answer is \(\boxed{45}\)."
"To find out what percentage of all the puppies have spots, we can follow these steps:

First, let's add up the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is:
\[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these puppies have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 spotted puppies, and Brandon's dog has 4 spotted puppies. So, the total number of spotted puppies is:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

Now, to find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the numbers we have:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 \]

To calculate this, we can divide 7 by 20 and then multiply by 100:
\[ \frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \]
\[ 0.35 \times 100 = 35 \]

So, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is 35%. 

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how many trips the farmer needs to make.

First, we calculate the total weight of each type of feed:

1. **Sugar Cubes:**
   - Each box weighs 1 pound.
   - He buys 2 boxes.
   - Total weight = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

2. **Carrots:**
   - Each bag weighs 12 pounds.
   - He buys 4 bags.
   - Total weight = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

3. **Hay:**
   - Each bale weighs 75 pounds.
   - He buys 42 bales.
   - Total weight = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

4. **Oats:**
   - Each sack weighs 65 pounds.
   - He buys 20 sacks.
   - Total weight = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

Now, we add up all these weights to get the total weight of the feed:
\[
2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
\]

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:
\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed. The answer is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles each week. Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents, and each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.

First, let's calculate how much she earns from the aluminum cans each week:
- She drinks 3 cans, and each can is worth 2 cents.
- So, \(3 \times 2 = 6\) cents from aluminum cans each week.

Next, let's calculate how much she earns from the plastic bottles each week:
- She drinks 5 bottles, and each bottle is worth 3 cents.
- So, \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cents from plastic bottles each week.

Now, let's add these two amounts to find out how much she earns in total each week:
- Total weekly earnings = \(6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}\).

To find out how much she earns in a four-week month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
- Total earnings in a four-week month = \(21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}\).

So, Grayson earns \(\boxed{84}\) cents from recycling in a four-week month."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Frederick has 10 plants. Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick. To find out how many plants Toni has, we calculate 60% of 10 and add that to 10.

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.60 \times 10 = 6 \]

So, Toni has:

\[ 10 + 6 = 16 \text{ plants} \]

Now, Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni. So, we subtract 7 from the number of plants Toni has:

\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]

Therefore, Shondra has 9 plants. The final answer is 9."
"Leila gave Ali half of her $100, which is $100 / 2 = $50. 

Now, Ali had $21 and got an extra $50 from Leila. So, Ali has $21 + $50 = $71 now.

The final answer is $71."
"To find out the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate the tip first. The tip is 1/5 of the cost of the pizza, which is $15.

First, let's find out what 1/5 of $15 is:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \]
So, the tip is $3.

Now, we add the tip to the original cost of the pizza:
\[ 15 + 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man is $18.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{18}\)."

"Miss Maria has six decks of basketball cards, and each deck has 25 cards. So, the total number of basketball cards is:

\[ 6 \text{ decks} \times 25 \text{ cards/deck} = 150 \text{ basketball cards} \]

She also has five boxes of baseball cards, and each box has 40 cards. So, the total number of baseball cards is:

\[ 5 \text{ boxes} \times 40 \text{ cards/box} = 200 \text{ baseball cards} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of cards:

\[ 150 \text{ basketball cards} + 200 \text{ baseball cards} = 350 \text{ cards} \]

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[ 350 \text{ total cards} - 50 \text{ cards kept} = 300 \text{ cards given to students} \]

If her students each get 10 cards, the number of students is:

\[ \frac{300 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards/student}} = 30 \text{ students} \]

So, Miss Maria has 30 students. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Becky and Kelly.

First, we calculate how much Becky paid. Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Becky got a $1 discount, so we subtract that from the total:
\[ 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's look at Kelly. Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

Kelly got a 10% discount on the total amount. To find the discount, we calculate 10% of 10 dollars:
\[ 10 \times 0.10 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, we subtract the discount from the total:
\[ 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract Becky's total from Kelly's total:
\[ 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar} \]

So, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Each room has:
- 2 sheets
- 1 comforter
- 4 pillow cases (because it's twice the number of sheets)
- 8 towels (because it's twice the number of pillow cases)

So, the total number of pieces of laundry per room is:
2 sheets + 1 comforter + 4 pillow cases + 8 towels = 15 pieces of laundry per room.

Now, if there are 80 rooms, we need to find out how many pieces of laundry there are in total:
15 pieces of laundry per room × 80 rooms = 1200 pieces of laundry.

So, the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms is 1200."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair has 2 shoes, he gets \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes. On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, which is \(15 \times 2 = 30\) shoes. On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, which is \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes.

Now, let's add up all the shoes he gains:
\[10 \text{ (Monday)} + 30 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 60 \text{ (Friday)} = 100 \text{ shoes}\]

So, after gaining these shoes, he has:
\[200 \text{ (initial shoes)} + 100 \text{ (gained shoes)} = 300 \text{ shoes}\]

On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes:
\[300 \text{ (total shoes)} - 180 \text{ (shoes removed)} = 120 \text{ shoes}\]

Therefore, the number of shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday is 120. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"Mary has 6 jars of sprinkles, and each jar can decorate 8 cupcakes. So, the total number of cupcakes she can decorate is:

\[ 6 \text{ jars} \times 8 \text{ cupcakes per jar} = 48 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Each pan can hold 12 cupcakes. To find out how many pans she needs, we divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of cupcakes each pan can hold:

\[ 48 \text{ cupcakes} \div 12 \text{ cupcakes per pan} = 4 \text{ pans} \]

So, Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The pen costs $2. The piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen. So, we calculate three times the price of the pen:

\[
3 \times 2 = 6
\]

Then we subtract $1:

\[
6 - 1 = 5
\]

So, the piece of paper costs $5.

Now, we add the cost of the pen and the piece of paper together:

\[
2 + 5 = 7
\]

The total cost is $7. Theo gave the cashier $10. To find out how much change she gets, we subtract the total cost from $10:

\[
10 - 7 = 3

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. **Total pencils at the start:**
   - There are 30 students, and each student starts with 10 pencils.
   - So, the total number of pencils is \(30 \times 10 = 300\) pencils.

2. **Pencils used after two months:**
   - After two months, 1/5 of the pencils were used.
   - So, the number of pencils used is \(300 \times \frac{1}{5} = 60\) pencils.

3. **Pencils remaining after two months:**
   - The number of pencils left after using 60 is \(300 - 60 = 240\) pencils.

4. **Pencils left at the end of the year:**
   - At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   - So, the number of pencils left is \(240 \times \frac{1}{3} = 80\) pencils.

Therefore, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is 80.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra. We know he wants to have 5 cookies in total. So, if we let \( x \) be the number of carrot sticks he eats, the number of cookies he can have is \( \frac{x}{2} + 2 \).

We know this equals 5 cookies:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + 2 = 5 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ \frac{x}{2} = 3 \]

Then, we multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies. The answer is 6."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to convert the shark's length from feet to inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, a 10-foot shark is:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know each remora is 6 inches long and there are 2 remoras. So, the total length of the remoras is:
\[ 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we want to find what percentage 12 inches (the total length of the remoras) is of the shark's total length (120 inches). The formula to find the percentage is:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100 = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

So, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{10\%} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that one-fourth of the students don't have a desktop computer. The problem tells us that 20 students don't have desktop computers. So, if 20 students represent one-fourth of the total number of students, we can find the total number of students by multiplying 20 by 4.

\[
20 \times 4 = 80
\]

So, the total number of students at that grade level is 80.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"To figure out how many minutes Jason needs to walk each day, we start by knowing he needs to walk a total of 240 minutes to break in his new shoes. He plans to walk for 4 days in a week. So, we need to divide the total minutes by the number of days he will walk.

\[ \text{Minutes per day} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ days}} \]

Now, let's do the division:

\[ \text{Minutes per day} = 60 \]

So, Jason needs to spend 60 minutes walking each day.

Sarah spent $300 on books, and each book costs $15. To find out how many books she bought, we divide the total amount she spent by the cost of each book:

\[ \text{Total number of books} = \frac{300}{15} = 20 \]

Now, Sarah has 20 books and she wants to give an equal number to her 4 kids. To find out how many books each child gets, we divide the total number of books by the number of kids:

\[ \text{Books per child} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, each child gets 5 books. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both. To find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. This means we add the number of kids allergic to dairy to the number of kids allergic to peanuts and then subtract the number of kids allergic to both (since they were counted twice).

So, we calculate:
\[ 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

This means 12 kids are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \]

Therefore, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"

- There are 3 groups of employees.
- Each group has 200 employees.

So, the total number of employees is:
\[ 3 \times 200 = 600 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of tour guides:
- There are 3 groups of tour guides.
- Each group has 7 tour guides.

So, the total number of tour guides is:
\[ 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Now, we add the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides to find the total number of people going on the tour:
\[ 600 + 21 = 621 \]

So, the total number of people going on the tour is 621."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the plane tickets cost. Tom and his wife each need a plane ticket, so:
\[ 5000 \times 2 = 10000 \]

Next, we need to figure out how much the hotel costs. Normally, the hotel costs $1500 per day, but it's 20% more expensive because it's a busy weekend. So, we calculate 20% of $1500:
\[ 0.20 \times 1500 = 300 \]
Adding this to the normal price gives:
\[ 1500 + 300 = 1800 \]
Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 1800 \times 3 = 5400 \]

Now, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:
\[ 10000 + 5400 = 15400 \]

So, the total cost of the trip is $15400. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{15400} \]"

\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ tubes of blue paint} \]

Jasper also has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has:

\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ tubes of yellow paint} \]

Now, to find out how many tubes of paint Jasper has in total, we add the blue and yellow paint tubes together:

\[ 2 + 9 = 11 \]

So, Jasper has 11 tubes of paint in total. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains. The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. So, we calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:

\[
\text{Weight of the 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = 36 \text{ grains}
\]

Now, to find the combined weight of both pennies, we add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny:

\[
\text{Combined weight} = 36 \text{ grains} + 48 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains}
\]

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains. 

The correct answer is 84 grains."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, so:

\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

So, Luri has 60 songs on his player.

Each player can hold up to 100 songs. To find out how many more songs each can add, we subtract the number of songs they already have from the maximum number of songs each player can hold.

For Gabriel:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]
So, Gabriel can add 80 more songs.

For Luri:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]
So, Luri can add 40 more songs.

Now, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:

\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel can add.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

So, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240. 

The final answer is: **$240**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jillian's shoes cost $80. The problem says her handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. So, we can write this as:
\[ \text{Cost of handbag} = 3 \times \text{Cost of shoes} - 20 \]

Substituting the cost of her shoes:
\[ \text{Cost of handbag} = 3 \times 80 - 20 \]

Now, let's do the math:
\[ \text{Cost of handbag} = 240 - 20 \]
\[ \text{Cost of handbag} = 220 \]

So, the cost of Jillian's handbag is $220. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{220} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

James runs 12 miles a day and he does this for 5 days in a week. So, to find out how many miles he runs in a week, we multiply the miles he runs each day by the number of days he runs in a week:

\[ 12 \, \text{miles/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 60 \, \text{miles/week} \]

Now, James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he runs in a week, we divide the total miles he runs in a week by his running speed:

\[ \frac{60 \, \text{miles/week}}{10 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 6 \, \text{hours/week} \]

So, James runs for 6 hours a week. The answer is 6 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much oats one horse eats in a day. Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and gets two meals a day, so:

\[ 5 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 10 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, since Uncle Ben has four horses, we multiply the daily oats needed for one horse by four:

\[ 10 \text{ pounds/day/horse} \times 4 \text{ horses} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much oats all the horses eat in five days:

\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Each bag of oats contains 50 pounds, so we divide the total amount of oats needed by the amount in one bag to find out how many bags Uncle Ben needs:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds/bag}} = 4 \text{ bags} \]

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days. The answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Heather buys 2 packs of razors. Each pack costs $4.00, so 2 packs cost $8.00.
2. With the ""buy one get one free"" offer, for every pack she buys, she gets another pack for free. So, for 2 packs, she only pays for 1 pack, which is $4.00.
3. Heather also has a $2.00 coupon, so after using the coupon, the cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.
4. Since 2 packs contain 4 razors, the cost for 4 razors is $2.00. So, the cost per razor is $2.00 ÷ 4 = $0.50.
5. To convert $0.50 to cents, we multiply by 100, so $0.50 = 50 cents.

Therefore, the cost per individual razor after the discount is \(\boxed{50}\) cents."
"To find the height of the human pyramid, we need to add up the heights of all the cheerleaders in the pyramid. The pyramid is structured with 4 girls on the bottom, 3 on the next layer, 2 on the next, and 1 at the top.

First, let's calculate the total height of the bottom layer:
- There are 4 girls, and each is 64 inches tall.
\[ 4 \times 64 = 256 \text{ inches} \]

Next, let's calculate the total height of the second layer:
- There are 3 girls, and each is 64 inches tall.
\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ inches} \]

Then, let's calculate the total height of the third layer:
- There are 2 girls, and each is 64 inches tall.
\[ 2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ inches} \]

Finally, the top layer has 1 girl who is 60 inches tall.
\[ 1 \times 60 = 60 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add up all these heights to get the total height of the pyramid:
\[ 256 + 192 + 128 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches} \]

To convert the total height from inches to feet, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}\):
\[ \frac{636 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 53 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height of the human pyramid is:

Charisma works for 8 hours every day. She gets up and walks for 5 minutes every hour she's at work. We need to find out how many minutes she walks in 5 days.

First, let's see how many times she walks in one day. Since she works for 8 hours and she walks every hour, she walks 8 times a day. Each walk is 5 minutes long.

So, in one day, she walks:
\[ 8 \text{ walks/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/walk} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many minutes she walks in 5 days. We do this by multiplying the number of minutes she walks in one day by 5:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, after 5 days, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes. The answer is \(\boxed{200}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Brett is currently 14 years old. We need to find out how old Angela will be in four years, and that number will be three times Brett's current age.

First, we calculate three times Brett's current age:
\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

This means in four years, Angela will be 42 years old. To find out how old Angela is now, we subtract four years from 42:
\[ 42 - 4 = 38 \]

So, Angela is currently 38 years old. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Paul drives his car twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon. He does this for 14 days. Each morning ride costs $6, and each afternoon ride costs $2.

First, let's find out how many morning rides he had:
- He drives twice a day, so in 14 days, he drives 2 rides/day * 14 days = 28 morning rides.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the morning rides:
- Each morning ride costs $6, so 28 rides * $6 = $168.

Next, let's find out how many afternoon rides he had:
- He also drives twice a day, so in 14 days, he drives 2 rides/day * 14 days = 28 afternoon rides.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the afternoon rides:
- Each afternoon ride costs $2, so 28 rides * $2 = $56.

Finally, let's add the costs of the morning and afternoon rides to find the total cost:
- $168 (morning rides) + $56 (afternoon rides) = $224.

So, Paul spent a total of $224 on driving his car during these 14 days. The correct answer is $224."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges in each box. So, Ashley brought:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges} \]

Brianne brought 20 more oranges than Ashley, so she brought:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges} \]

Now, let's add the oranges brought by Ashley and Brianne:
\[ 50 + 70 = 120 \text{ oranges} \]

Each Greek orange pie needs 3 oranges. To find out how many pies they can make, we divide the total number of oranges by 3:
\[ 120 \div 3 = 40 \text{ pies} \]

So, they can make 40 greek orange pies. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step.

For the first venue, the cost is $200 plus $5 for each guest. So, if there are \( n \) guests, the total cost is \( 200 + 5n \).

For the second venue, the cost is $25 for each guest, and food is included, so the total cost is $25 per guest. So, if there are \( n \) guests, the total cost is \( 25n \).

We need to find out how many guests make the costs the same. So, we set the two costs equal to each other:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]

Now, let's solve this equation:
\[ 200 + 5n = 25n \]
Subtract \( 5n \) from both sides:
\[ 200 = 20n \]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[ n = 10 \]

So, the number of guests necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost is 10.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that together they collected 43 insects. Let's say David found \( D \) insects. According to the problem, Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found \( D + 7 \) insects. Also, David found half of what Bodhi found, so Bodhi found \( 2D \) insects.

The total number of insects they collected is:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Now, divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

So, David found 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, we add 7 to David's count:
\[ D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]

Therefore, Lily found 16 insects. The correct answer is 16."
"To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to add the amounts of yarn they each used.

Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn, and since there are 364 yards in a skein, she used:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards} \]

Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn, so she used:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:
\[ 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards} \]

So, the total number of yards of yarn they used altogether is 273 yards. The correct answer is 273 yards."
"Cherrie has 5 friends, and 2 of them want 5 gifts each, so that's 2 * 5 = 10 gifts. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each, so that's 3 * 2 = 6 gifts. Adding these together, Cherrie buys 10 + 6 = 16 gifts for her friends. She also decides to buy 10 more random gifts. So, the total number of gifts she buys is 16 + 10 = 26. 

The final answer is 26."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

We know the chair is 3 feet wide. The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug is:
\[ 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet} \text{ wide.} \]

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. First, we find out twice the width of the rug:
\[ 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet.} \]

Now, we add 2 feet to that to get the length of the couch:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet.} \]

So, the length of the couch is 18 feet. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Suzie bought four packs of gum in total. Two of those packs were strawberry gum, and the other two were different flavors. She paid $2 for each pack of grape gum and $1 for the small pack of green apple gum because it was half the price of the grape gum.

So, the equation for the total cost is:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Where \( S \) is the cost of each pack of strawberry gum. Now, let's solve this equation:

First, we simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = 2 \]

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Frederick has $24 to spend on wood. A 2 x 4 costs $4, and a 2 x 8 costs $6.

First, let's see how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy:
- He can buy $24 ÷ $4 = 6 pieces of 2 x 4.
- Each 2 x 4 gives him 200 sticks, so 6 pieces give him 6 × 200 = 1200 sticks.

Next, let's see how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy:
- He can buy $24 ÷ $6 = 4 pieces of 2 x 8.
- Each 2 x 8 gives him 400 sticks, so 4 pieces give him 4 × 400 = 1600 sticks.

Since 1600 sticks from 2 x 8 pieces is more than 1200 sticks from 2 x 4 pieces, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 pieces to get the most sticks.

So, the most popsicle sticks he can make is 1600.

The answer is: 1600"
"Mario needs to buy snowshoes for 6 sled dogs, and each dog has 4 legs. So, he needs 6 pairs of snowshoes. If each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, then the total cost will be:

\[ 6 \text{ pairs} \times 12 \text{ dollars per pair} = 72 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is $72.00. 

The correct answer is: **$72.00**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Janet takes 2 bus trips each day, and she does this 5 days a week. So, she takes \(2 \times 5 = 10\) bus trips in a week.

Each bus trip costs her $2.20, so for 10 trips, the total cost is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Now, a weekly bus pass costs $20. To find out how much she saves, we subtract the cost of the pass from the total cost of the bus trips:

\[22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00\]

So, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass.

The correct answer is that Janet would save **$2.00**."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We know the farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep. The zoo has 20 sheep. The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm, so the zoo has \(2 \times 30 = 60\) cows. The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo, so the farm has \(20 \div 2 = 10\) sheep, which we already knew.

Now, let's add up all the animals:
- The farm has \(30 + 10 = 40\) animals.
- The zoo has \(60 + 20 = 80\) animals.

So, the total number of animals on the farm and the zoo combined is \(40 + 80 = 120\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, which totals to 16 items (12 onions + 4 potatoes = 16 items).

The problem states that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. So, if we let the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought be \( S \), then Rose bought 4 times \( S \). This means:
\[ 4S = 16 \]

To find \( S \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S = 4 \]

So, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To figure out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day to lose 30 pounds by his birthday, we can break it down step by step.

First, Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. So, to lose 30 pounds, he needs to burn:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times 3500 \text{ calories/pound} = 105000 \text{ calories} \]

Next, we need to know how many days Andy has until his birthday. From December 31st to July 19th, we count the days:

- December has 31 days, but Andy only has 31 days left in December.
- January has 31 days.
- February has 28 days (2023 is not a leap year).
- March has 31 days.
- April has 30 days.
- May has 31 days.
- June has 30 days.
- July has 19 days.

Adding these up:
\[ 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 222 \text{ days} \]

Now, to find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories by the number of days:
\[ \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{222 \text{ days}} \approx 473.66 \text{ calories/day} \]

So, Andy needs to create a daily calorie deficit of about 473.66 calories each day to reach his goal.

The closest option to 473.66 is:
\[ \boxed{474} \]"
"Gerald earns $30 every day and works for 7 days in a week. So, his total earnings are:

\[ 30 \times 7 = 210 \]

He spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from his total earnings:

\[ 210 - 100 = 110 \]

So, Gerald has $110 left. 

The correct answer is **110**."
"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total distance she will run. She is told to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0.25 kilometers. So, the total distance in kilometers is:

\[ 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km} \]

Now, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. Therefore, for 2 kilometers, the total amount of water she needs to drink is:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

So, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 120 ml. 

The correct answer is: 120 ml"
"Okay, let me walk you through this step by step.

Julie started with $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes. To find out how much she spent on clothes, we calculate 20% of $500:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes. Now, we subtract that from her total:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Julie then spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs. To find out how much she spent on CDs, we calculate 25% of $400:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs. Now, we subtract that from the remaining $400:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

So, Julie has $300 left. 

The final amount of money Julie has left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We also know that the house costs three times as much as the lot. Let's call the cost of the lot \( L \) and the cost of the house \( H \).

So, we have:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H + L = 120,000 \]

Now, we can substitute \( H \) in the second equation with \( 3L \):
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]

To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 4:
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000 \]

Now that we know the lot costs $30,000, we can find the cost of the house:
\[ H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000 \]

So, the house costs $90,000.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{90000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Tara bought 8 packs of 5 canvas bags each, so she got:
\[ 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ bags} \]

Each pack costs $4, so the total cost is:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

She sold each bag for $8, so the total money she made from selling all the bags is:
\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much profit she made, we subtract the total cost from the total money she made:
\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Tara earned is:
\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out the total time of the fight. The fight lasts 5 rounds, and each round is 3 minutes long. So, we multiply the number of rounds by the minutes per round:

\[ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes/round} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we know Joe throws 25 punches every minute. To find out how many punches he throws in 15 minutes, we multiply the number of punches per minute by the total minutes of the fight:

\[ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} \]

So, the total number of punches Joe threw is 375. 

The final answer is 375."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies Suzanne made, so we calculate:

\[
\text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
\]

Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, which means Kelsie made:

\[
\text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

So, Kelsie made 18 cookies. 

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much money Ali has in total. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, we calculate:

\[
4 \times 10 = 40
\]
\[
6 \times 20 = 120
\]
\[
40 + 120 = 160
\]

So, Ali has $160 in total.

Next, he gives half of this money to his sister. So, we calculate half of $160:

\[
\frac{160}{2} = 80
\]

This means he gives $80 to his sister, so the remaining money is:

\[
160 - 80 = 80
\]

Now, he uses \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 to buy dinner. We calculate \(\frac{3}{5}\) of $80:

\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48
\]

So, he spends $48 on dinner. The money left after buying dinner is:

\[
80 - 48 = 32
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner is $32."

- Hats: 2 skeins
- Scarves: 4 skeins
- Sweaters: 12 skeins
- Mittens: 1 skein
- Socks: 2 skeins

Now, since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we multiply the number of each item by 3:
- Hats: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) skeins
- Scarves: \(4 \times 3 = 12\) skeins
- Sweaters: \(12 \times 3 = 36\) skeins
- Mittens: \(1 \times 3 = 3\) skeins
- Socks: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) skeins

Next, we add up all the skeins needed:
\[6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63\]

So, Martha will need to buy 63 skeins of wool. The final answer is 63."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

\[ 100 - 12 = 88 \]

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. So, the number of problems he completes on Tuesday is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \]

After Tuesday, the number of problems left is:
\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \]

On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, the number of problems he completes on Wednesday is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13 \]

After Wednesday, the number of problems left is:
\[ 52 - 13 = 39 \]

So, the number of problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
2. Bobby picks one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, let's add up all the quarts they can pick per hour:
\[ 6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29 \]

So, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is 29.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jackson has 36 red tulips and can plant 6 red tulips in a row. So, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} \]

Next, Jackson has 24 blue tulips and can plant 8 blue tulips in a row. So, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} \]

Now, to find out the total number of rows of flowers, we add the rows of red tulips and the rows of blue tulips together:

\[ 6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows} \]

So, the total number of rows of flowers Jackson will plant is 9."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Heather has 27 cups of raisins. She wants to divide these equally among making oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix. So, she will have 9 cups of raisins for each of these items.

Now, each batch of oatmeal cookies needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. To find out how many batches she can make, we divide the 9 cups she has for oatmeal cookies by 3/4 cup per batch.

This is the same as multiplying 9 by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3. So, it's:

\[ 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = 12 \]

Therefore, Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much Ada spends on electricity each week before and after she adds the new device.

### Before Adding the New Device:
- Ada uses 12 kilowatts per hour each day.
- The cost per kilowatt per hour is $1.50.
- There are 7 days in a week.

So, the daily cost is:
\[ 12 \text{ kW/h} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$18 \]

For a week, the cost is:
\[ \$18 \times 7 = \$126 \]

### After Adding the New Device:
- The new device uses 2 kilowatts per hour each day.
- So, the total daily consumption is:
\[ 12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h} \]

The daily cost now is:
\[ 14 \text{ kW/h} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$21 \]

For a week, the cost is:
\[ \$21 \times 7 = \$147 \]

### Finding the Difference:
Now, we need to find out how much more Ada will spend in a week after adding the new device:
\[ \$147 - \$126 = \$21 \]

So, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that one person can paint half a house in 5 days. So, in one day, one person can paint half of half a house, which is a quarter of a house. That means one person paints \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a house in one day.

Now, if we have 5 people working together, they can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{4}\) of a house in one day. This means they can paint a whole house in \(\frac{4}{5}\) of a day.

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we need to convert \(\frac{4}{5}\) of a day into hours. So, \(\frac{4}{5} \times 24 = \frac{96}{5} = 19.2\) hours.

Therefore, it would take 5 people 19.2 hours to paint a whole house. The closest option to 19.2 hours from the given choices would be 19 hours.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{19}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler numbers.

We know Ophelia has 20 sofas. The problem tells us that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if we let the number of chairs Ophelia has be \( C_O \), we can write:
\[ S_O = C_O - 2 \]
Since \( S_O = 20 \), we can substitute and solve for \( C_O \):
\[ 20 = C_O - 2 \]
\[ C_O = 20 + 2 \]
\[ C_O = 22 \]
So, Ophelia has 22 chairs.

The problem also says Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. So, if we let the number of chairs Jenna has be \( C_J \), we can write:
\[ C_J = 3 \times C_O \]
Since \( C_O = 22 \), we can substitute and find \( C_J \):
\[ C_J = 3 \times 22 \]
\[ C_J = 66 \]
So, Jenna has 66 chairs.

The problem also says Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs. So, if we let the number of sofas Jenna has be \( S_J \), we can write:
\[ S_J = C_J - 2 \]
Since \( C_J = 66 \), we can substitute and find \( S_J \):
\[ S_J = 66 - 2 \]
\[ S_J = 64 \]
So, Jenna has 64 sofas.

Now, let's add up all the sofas and chairs they have together:
\[ \text{Total sofas} = S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \]
\[ \text{Total chairs} = C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 84 + 88 = 172 \]

So, the total number of sofas and chairs they have is 172. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{172} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tom spent $48 in total. He bought a CD for $4, so the rest of the money he spent on the headphone set is:
\[ 48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, if Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have $48 to spend on CDs. Since each CD costs $4, we can find out how many CDs he could buy with $48:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ CDs} \]

Since he originally bought 1 CD, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
\[ 12 - 1 = 11 \text{ CDs} \]

So, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he hadn't bought the headphone set. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To find out the total number of hours Josh spent working out over 8 weeks, we need to add up the hours he worked out each week.

First, we know that for 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week. So, we calculate:
\[ 6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours} \]

Next, for 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. So, we calculate:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ hours/week} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

Lastly, for 1 week, he worked out for 6 hours. So, we calculate:
\[ 1 \text{ week} \times 6 \text{ hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we add all these hours together:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 40 hours."
"Let's go through the problem step by step:

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, after the first stop, the number of people on the bus is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 people get off the bus.
- The number of people who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) people.

So, after the second stop, the number of people on the bus is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

Therefore, the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step again in a simpler way.

1. **Jame's Current Age:**
   - Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so he is currently \(27 - 5 = 22\) years old.

2. **Cousin's Age in 8 Years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \(22 + 8 = 30\) years old.
   - His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years. So, twice Jame's age in 8 years is \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - Therefore, his cousin's age in 8 years will be \(60 - 5 = 55\) years.

3. **Cousin's Current Age:**
   - If his cousin will be 55 in 8 years, then his cousin is currently \(55 - 8 = 47\) years old.

4. **Age Difference:**
   - Jame is 22 years old now.
   - His cousin is 47 years old now.
   - The difference in their ages is \(47 - 22 = 25\) years.

So, the number of years that separate their ages is 25 years. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total cost of the computer, two monitors, and a printer is $2,400. The computer costs $1,100, and the printer costs $400 less than the computer. So, the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.

Now, we can write the equation for the total cost:
\[ \text{Cost of computer} + 2 \times \text{Cost of one monitor} + \text{Cost of printer} = 2400 \]
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

So, the cost of one monitor is $300. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know there are 20 kids in total, and they are divided equally into boys and girls. So, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Each boy brought 60 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought by all the boys is:
\[ 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ seashells/boy} = 600 \text{ seashells} \]

Now, each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells the boys brought plus four times that amount. So, each girl brought:
\[ 60 \text{ seashells} + 4 \times 60 \text{ seashells} = 60 \text{ seashells} + 240 \text{ seashells} = 300 \text{ seashells} \]

Since there are 10 girls, the total number of seashells brought by all the girls is:
\[ 10 \text{ girls} \times 300 \text{ seashells/girl} = 3000 \text{ seashells} \]

But the question asks specifically how many seashells each girl brought, which is:
\[ 300 \text{ seashells} \]

So, the number of seashells brought by each girl is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"Okay, let's think through this step by step:

1. George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies. This means George originally had \(3 + 5 = 8\) candies.
2. Nick had twice as many candies as George originally had. So, Nick had \(2 \times 8 = 16\) candies.

Therefore, the number of candies Nick has is 16.

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Chenny is 10 years old. Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, so we calculate Alyana's age as follows:
\[ \text{Alyana's age} = 10 - 4 = 6 \]

Now, Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, so we find Anne's age by adding 2 to Alyana's age:
\[ \text{Anne's age} = 6 + 2 = 8 \]

Therefore, Anne is 8 years old. The correct answer is:

\[ 8 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find the total thickness of the four books.

1. The first book is 31 mm thick.
2. The second book is 50 mm thick.
3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, so we calculate:
   \[
   50 \text{ mm} - 5 \text{ mm} = 45 \text{ mm}
   \]
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 31 \text{ mm} = 62 \text{ mm}
   \]

Now, we add the thicknesses of all four books together:
\[
31 \text{ mm} + 50 \text{ mm} + 45 \text{ mm} + 62 \text{ mm}
\]

Adding these step by step:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]
\[
81 + 45 = 126
\]
\[
126 + 62 = 188
\]

So, the total thickness of the four books is 188 mm. 

The correct answer is \boxed{188}."
"Emma can make 72 vlogs in a month. So far, she has made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we add the vlogs she has already made and subtract that from her monthly goal.

18 (first week) + 21 (second week) + 15 (third week) = 54 vlogs

Now, we subtract the total vlogs she has made from her monthly goal:

72 (monthly goal) - 54 (vlogs already made) = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal. The correct answer is 18."
"To figure out how much you ended up paying, we need to add a 20% tip to the $50 dinner bill.

First, let's calculate the tip:
- 20% of $50 is calculated by multiplying $50 by 0.20 (which is the decimal form of 20%).
- So, the tip is $50 * 0.20 = $10.

Now, we add the tip to the original bill:
- The total amount is $50 (original bill) + $10 (tip) = $60.

So, you ended up paying $60."
"Let's break down the problem step by step as if I'm explaining it to someone with a high school education.

1. **Initial Sharing:**
   - We start with $18 and it's shared among 3 boys.
   - Each boy gets an equal share:
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   So, each boy gets $6.

2. **Eldest Boy's Actions:**
   - The eldest boy adds $5 to his share:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The next day, he adds another $10:
     \[
     11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Spending $8:**
   - The eldest boy spends $8 from his total:
     \[
     21 - 8 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Tripling the Remaining Amount:**
   - After spending $8, he triples the remaining amount:
     \[
     13 \times 3 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, the final amount the eldest boy has is:
\[
\boxed{39}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in April. He plans to save twice as much in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. April has 30 days, so the first half has 15 days and the second half also has 15 days.

Let's say Elvis saves \( x \) dollars each day in the first half of April. So, in the first half, he saves \( 15x \) dollars in total.

In the second half, he saves \( 2x \) dollars each day. So, in the second half, he saves \( 15 \times 2x = 30x \) dollars in total.

The total savings for the month is the sum of the savings from the first and second halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

We know this total is $1125, so:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 45:
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25 \]

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of April. For the second half, he saves:
\[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- So, the cost of the apples is 3 * $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, we calculate the cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- So, the cost of the oranges is 5 * $0.80 = $4.00.

Then, we calculate the cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- So, the cost of the peaches is 6 * $0.75 = $4.50.

Now, we add up the total cost of all the fruits:
- Total cost = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges + Cost of peaches
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00.

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
- Change received = Amount given - Total cost
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

So, the change Verna received is $7.00."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jairus earns $0.8 for each task, and he finished 20 tasks. So, we calculate his total earnings like this:

\[
0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Jenny earns $0.5 for each task, and she also finished 20 tasks. So, her total earnings are:

\[
0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, to find out how much more Jairus earned than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:

\[
16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Jairus earned $6 more than Jenny. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jeff and Brad together have 100 dollars, and Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. Let's say Brad gets \( B \) dollars. Then Jeff gets \( 4B \) dollars.

So, the total money can be written as:
\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find out how much Brad gets, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

So, Brad gets 20 dollars. Now, to find out how much Jeff gets, we multiply Brad's amount by 4:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.

The final answer is:
\[ 80 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step. Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, so that's a total of 6 miles per day. If he works 5 days a week, then the total number of miles he walks in a week is 6 miles/day times 5 days, which equals 30 miles.

So, the total number of miles Jeff walks in a week is 30 miles. 

The answer is 30 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Elise writes the alphabet twice, which means she writes 26 letters twice. So, that's \(26 \times 2 = 52\) letters.

Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes 13 letters.

After that, she rewrites everything she has already written. The total number of letters she has written so far is 52 (from the two full alphabets) plus 13 (from half the alphabet), which is \(52 + 13 = 65\). She then writes all 65 letters again, so that's another 65 letters.

Now, let's add it all up: \(52 + 13 + 65 = 129\).

So, the total number of letters Elise has written is 129."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. **First Round:**
   - Ali calls 3 families.
   - So, 3 families are notified.

2. **Second Round:**
   - Each of the 3 families calls 3 other families.
   - So, \(3 \times 3 = 9\) families are notified.

3. **Third Round:**
   - Each of the 9 families calls 3 other families.
   - So, \(9 \times 3 = 27\) families are notified.

4. **Fourth Round:**
   - Each of the 27 families calls 3 other families.
   - So, \(27 \times 3 = 81\) families are notified.

Therefore, the number of families notified during the fourth round of calls is \(\boxed{81}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mark was unwell for 3 months and lost 10 pounds each month. So, over 3 months, he lost a total of 10 pounds/month × 3 months = 30 pounds. If his final weight was 70 pounds, then before he got sick, he must have weighed 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds. 

The options might look like this in a multiple-choice format:
A) 80 pounds
B) 90 pounds
C) 100 pounds
D) 110 pounds

The correct answer would be C) 100 pounds."
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. James's play set has 80 toys.
2. A play set five times larger than James's would have \(5 \times 80 = 400\) toys.
3. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys. So, if he has \(x\) toys now, then \(x + 2 = 400\).

Now, we solve for \(x\):
\[ x + 2 = 400 \]
\[ x = 400 - 2 \]
\[ x = 398 \]

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys. The correct answer is \(\boxed{398}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Daniel has to spend.

First, we need to calculate the cost of each item Daniel wants to buy:
- Five notebooks at $1.50 each: \(5 \times 1.50 = 7.50\)
- Two pens at $0.25 each: \(2 \times 0.25 = 0.50\)
- One calculator at $12: \(1 \times 12 = 12\)
- One geometry set at $10: \(1 \times 10 = 10\)

Now, let's add up all these costs to find the total before the discount:
\[7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 20\]

The shop gives a 10% discount on all the items. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $20:
\[10\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.10 \times 20 = 2\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Daniel has to pay:
\[20 - 2 = 18\]

So, Daniel has to spend \(\boxed{18}\) dollars on all the items he wants to buy."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much change Carly gets back.

First, we calculate the cost of the hamburgers:
\[ 5 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$4 \text{ per hamburger} = \$20 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the potato fries:
\[ 10 \text{ packs of potato fries} \times \$0.30 \text{ per pack} = \$3 \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the fruit drinks:
\[ 5 \text{ cans of fruit drinks} \times \$2 \text{ per can} = \$10 \]

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total:
\[ \$20 + \$3 + \$10 = \$33 \]

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we subtract the total cost from fifty dollars to find the change:
\[ \$50 - \$33 = \$17 \]

So, the change Carly gets back is \$17. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Antonella's earnings.

First, we need to calculate the commission for the first $1000 she sold. She gets a 30% commission on that amount:
\[ 1000 \times 0.30 = 300 \]
So, she earns $300 from the first $1000.

Next, we need to calculate the commission for the amount she sold over $1000. She sold $2500 in total, so the amount over $1000 is:
\[ 2500 - 1000 = 1500 \]
She gets an additional 10% commission on this amount:
\[ 1500 \times 0.10 = 150 \]
So, she earns $150 from the amount over $1000.

Now, we add the two amounts together to find her total earnings:
\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

Therefore, Antonella earned a total of $450. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Bill starts with 2 cases of water, and each case has 24 bottles. So, he has:
\[ 2 \times 24 = 48 \text{ bottles} \]

He has 70 guests coming, and he wants to give each guest 2 bottles of water. So, he needs:
\[ 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, to find out how many more bottles he needs to buy, we subtract the number of bottles he already has from the total number of bottles needed:
\[ 140 - 48 = 92 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Bill needs to buy 92 more bottles of water. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{92} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that when the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as in cold water. So, we need to calculate that first:
- Twice the time in cold water is \(2 \times 16 = 32\) minutes.
- Adding 2 minutes to that gives us \(32 + 2 = 34\) minutes.

So, in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in both cold and warm water:
- In cold water, for 3 miles, it would take \(3 \times 16 = 48\) minutes.
- In warm water, for 3 miles, it would take \(3 \times 34 = 102\) minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles in warm water compared to cold water, we subtract the time for cold water from the time for warm water:
- \(102 - 48 = 54\) minutes.

So, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day. The answer is 54 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day. So, his daily earnings are:
\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

He works 4 days a week, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

You bought a foot-long fish sub for $40. The six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much as the foot-long fish sub. So, the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs:

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

Now, to find the total cost for both subs, you add the cost of the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:

\[ 40 + 120 = 160 \]

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is $160.

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

We have a bag with 21 buttons. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each, and the rest have 4 holes each.

First, let's find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, the rest must have 4 holes:
\[ 21 - 7 = 14 \]
So, 14 buttons have 4 holes each.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with 2 holes:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \]
So, there are 14 holes from the buttons with 2 holes.

Now, we calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with 4 holes:
\[ 14 \times 4 = 56 \]
So, there are 56 holes from the buttons with 4 holes.

Finally, we add the holes from both types of buttons to get the total number of holes:
\[ 14 + 56 = 70 \]

So, the total number of holes in all the buttons is 70. The correct answer is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches. Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. If we let \( R \) be the daily recommended cups of coffee, then Octavia drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks, so he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

According to Juan's doctor, he should reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. This means Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by \( 5R - 4 \) cups.

Now, we need to find out how many cups Juan must reduce his intake by. Since the problem doesn't give us the exact value of \( R \), we can't calculate the exact number of cups. But if we assume \( R = 8 \) (a common daily recommended amount), then:

\[ 5R - 4 = 5 \times 8 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36 \]

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{36} \]"
"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to add up the hamsters and guinea pigs.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- So, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- So, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

So, the pet shop has a total of 45 rodents. The correct answer is 45."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mark weighs 150 pounds. Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so:
\[ 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds} \]

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so:
\[ 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up their weights:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by 3:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds. The final answer is:
\[ 180 \]"

1. The great pyramids are at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground.
2. The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is directly above the entrance.
3. The sun moves 5 degrees up from the pyramid every hour.
4. We need to find out how many degrees the sun will be from the ground after 10 hours.

First, we calculate how much the sun moves up in 10 hours:
\[ 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees} \]

Now, we add this to the initial angle of the pyramids from the ground:
\[ 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees} \]

So, after 10 hours, the sun will be 82 degrees from the ground.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{82}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

James has two sons. One son is 12 years old, and the other is 4 years younger, so the other son is 8 years old.

To find out how many candles James needs, we add the ages of his sons: 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Now, each pack contains 5 candles, so we need to figure out how many packs James needs to buy. We do this by dividing the total number of candles by the number of candles in each pack: 20 ÷ 5 = 4 packs.

Each pack costs $3, so we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack to find out how much James spends: 4 × $3 = $12.

So, James spends $12 on candles. The final answer is $12."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

In the first week, Judy reads for 15 minutes each night. Since there are 7 nights in a week, we calculate the total reading time in minutes for the first week:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pages Judy can read in 1 minute. We know she reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. So, to find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} \]

Now, we calculate how many pages Judy reads in 105 minutes:
\[ 105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages} \]

In the second week, Judy reads a total of 100 pages.

To find the total number of pages Judy reads in two weeks, we add the pages from the first week and the second week:
\[ 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages} \]

So, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches in total. 

First, we need to find out how many sandwiches Cody ate. Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \]
So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, so we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \]
So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

Now, we add the sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor to find the total number of sandwiches they ate together:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \]

Finally, we subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many are left:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \]

So, the number of sandwiches left is 5. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Shiloh is 44 years old now. In 7 years, he will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.

We're told that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. So, if we let the nephew's age in 7 years be \( x + 7 \), then we can write the equation:

\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]

Subtract 21 from both sides:

\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]

\[ 30 = 3x \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = 10 \]

So, the nephew is currently 10 years old. 

Therefore, the nephew's current age is \(\boxed{10}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth. Then, for each of the next three teeth, she gave $1.00 each. So for these three teeth, that's $1.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 = $3.00. For the last two teeth, she gave half the amount of $1.00, which is $0.50 per tooth. So for these two teeth, that's $0.50 + $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add it all up:
- First tooth: $5.00
- Next three teeth: $3.00
- Last two teeth: $1.00

So, $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

The tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Richie scored 80 goals. According to the problem, Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna. So, to find out how many goals Anna scored, we subtract 45 from Richie's goals:
\[ 80 - 45 = 35 \]
So, Anna scored 35 goals.

Next, we know Richie also scored 20 more goals than Mark. So, to find out how many goals Mark scored, we subtract 20 from Richie's goals:
\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \]
So, Mark scored 60 goals.

Now, to find out the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we add up the goals scored by Richie, Mark, and Anna:
\[ 80 + 60 + 35 = 175 \]

So, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is 175. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{175}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each. To find out how much Mitchell made, we multiply the number of lemonades by the price per lemonade:
\[ 21 \times 4 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Liam claimed to have made $63. To find out how much more Mitchell made than Liam, we subtract Liam's earnings from Mitchell's earnings:
\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mitchell made $21 more than Liam. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Peter has $70 and wants to spend $10 each day for 7 days. So, he spends $10 each day.

From Sunday to Wednesday, he buys wooden action figures. Each wooden action figure costs $5. He spends $20 on wooden action figures because \(4 \times 5 = 20\). Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he can buy \(20 \div 5 = 4\) wooden action figures.

For Thursday to Sunday, he buys plastic action figures. Each plastic action figure costs $2. He spends $8 on plastic action figures because \(4 \times 2 = 8\). Since each plastic action figure costs $2, he can buy \(8 \div 2 = 4\) plastic action figures.

So, by the end of the week, he has 4 wooden action figures and 4 plastic action figures. The total number of action figures is \(4 + 4 = 8\).

The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The cost to spay the kitten is $200.
2. The cost for 3 vaccines is $20 each, so that's 3 times $20, which is $60.
3. The kitten broke 4 vases, and each vase costs $12, so that's 4 times $12, which is $48.

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[ \$200 + \$60 + \$48 = \$308 \]

So, the total cost for the kitten so far is $308. 

The final answer is: **$308**"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. The flower shops order a total of:
- The first shop: 20 roses
- The second shop: 15 roses
- The third shop: 30 roses

So, the total number of roses ordered by the shops each week is:
\[ 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \]

Ford grows 40 roses each week, but the shops need 65 roses. So, he lacks:
\[ 65 - 40 = 25 \]
roses each week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of roses he lacks in a month is:
\[ 25 \times 4 = 100 \]

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month. The answer is 100."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account. She takes out $100 every month. We need to find out how much money is left after 2 years.

First, we need to know how many months are in 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, in 2 years there are:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months} \]

Katina takes out $100 each month, so in 24 months, she will have taken out:
\[ 24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we subtract the total amount she took out from the initial amount:
\[ 3000 - 2400 = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 left in her savings account. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"To find out the net profit, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how much it costs to make 10 sandwiches. They spend $30.00 on cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches. They also need 1 loaf of bread to make 10 sandwiches, and each loaf costs $3.00. So, the total cost for the bread is $3.00. Adding the cost of the bread and the cost of the cheese and condiments, we get:

Total cost = Cost of bread + Cost of cheese and condiments
Total cost = $3.00 + $30.00 = $33.00

Next, we need to find out how much they make from selling 10 sandwiches. They sell each sandwich for $7.00. So, the total revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is:

Total revenue = Number of sandwiches * Price per sandwich
Total revenue = 10 * $7.00 = $70.00

Now, to find the net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Net profit = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00

So, the net profit is $37.00. The correct answer is:

\boxed{37}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kate has 3 boxes of crayons, and each box contains 64 crayons. So, the total number of crayons is:

\[ 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons} \]

Each crayon is broken into 8 pieces to make a muffin crayon. So, the total number of pieces is:

\[ 192 \times 8 = 1536 \text{ pieces} \]

Kate can make one muffin crayon with 8 pieces. So, the number of muffins she can make is:

\[ \frac{1536}{8} = 192 \text{ muffins} \]

If she sells each muffin for $1.50, the total money she can make is:

\[ 192 \times 1.50 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Kate can make is:

\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out the area of Michael's bedroom. The bedroom is 18 feet by 12 feet, so:

\[ 18 \times 12 = 216 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding. The new carpet costs $12 per square foot and the padding costs $2 per square foot:

\[ 12 \times 216 = 2592 \text{ dollars for the carpet} \]
\[ 2 \times 216 = 432 \text{ dollars for the padding} \]

So, the total cost for the new carpet and padding is:

\[ 2592 + 432 = 3024 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to pay to remove the old carpet. The contractor charges $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet:

\[ 4 \times 216 = 864 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we need to pay to install the new carpet. The contractor charges $34 per square foot to install the new carpet:

\[ 34 \times 216 = 7344 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add all these costs together:

\[ 3024 + 864 + 7344 = 11232 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is:

\[ \boxed{11232} \]"
"To find out how many birds Mack saw on average each day, we need to add up all the birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.

First, let's add up the birds:
- On days 1 and 2, he saw 50 birds.
- On day 3, he saw 0 birds.
- On days 4 and 5, he saw 120 birds.
- On day 6, he saw 20 birds.
- On day 7, he saw 90 birds.

Now, let's add these numbers together:
\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many days there are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

To find the average number of birds seen per day, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
\[ \frac{280 \text{ birds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 40 \text{ birds per day} \]

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day. The final answer is:

"Okay, let's go through the problem step by step again, but in a simpler way.

1. **Starting Value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
   \[
   \text{Starting value} = 20
   \]

2. **First Operation**: Add half of the starting value to the starting value.
   \[
   \text{Half of the starting value} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{First operation result} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. **Second Operation**: Divide the result of the first operation by 5.
   \[
   \text{Second operation result} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

4. **Third Operation**: Multiply the result of the second operation by the starting value minus 12.
   \[
   \text{Starting value minus 12} = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final value} = 6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

So, the final value of the number train is 48."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. The boy has 5 cards.
2. His brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy, so the brother has \(5 - 3 = 2\) cards.
3. To find out how many cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards the brother has: \(5 + 2 = 7\).

So, the total number of cards they have together is 7. 

The final answer is 7."
"To solve this, we need to find the temperature setting that will give us the actual temperature of 520 degrees when the oven is off by 4%.

First, let's understand the error. When the oven is set to 450 degrees, the actual temperature is 468 degrees. The difference is 18 degrees, which is 4% of 450 degrees because:

\[ \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 4\% \]

So, the oven is off by 4% for any temperature setting. To get an actual temperature of 520 degrees, we need to find the temperature setting \( x \) such that:

\[ x - 0.04x = 520 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 0.96x = 520 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{520}{0.96} \]

\[ x = 541.67 \]

So, Maggie should set the oven to approximately 541.67 degrees to get the actual temperature of 520 degrees.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{541.67} \]"
"To find out how long it will take Max to watch both movies, we need to add the time for each movie together.

First, let's convert the time for the first movie into minutes:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 30 minutes is \(60 + 30 = 90\) minutes.

Next, let's convert the time for the second movie into minutes:
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
- 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
- Adding the 5 minutes, the second movie is \(120 + 5 = 125\) minutes long.

Now, we add the times together:
- The first movie is 90 minutes long.
- The second movie is 125 minutes long.
- Adding these together, \(90 + 125 = 215\) minutes.

So, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes. The correct answer is 215 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Herb's house is worth $76,000. Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, so we need to find out what 30% of $76,000 is and then subtract that from $76,000.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

So, Juan's house is worth:
\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of both houses, we add the value of Herb's house and Juan's house:
\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

So, the value of the two houses combined is $129,200. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{129200}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought 24 dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups. The friend also brought 20 more dishes than cups, so the friend brought 40 + 20 = 60 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the cups and dishes:

- Judy's cups: 12
- Judy's dishes: 24
- Friend's cups: 40
- Friend's dishes: 60

Total cups: 12 + 40 = 52
Total dishes: 24 + 60 = 84

So, the total number of utensils brought by both is 52 cups + 84 dishes = 136 utensils.

The total number of utensils brought by the two is \boxed{136}."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much one box of contacts costs after the discount. The original price is $100.00, and there's a 10% discount. So, we calculate the discount amount:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

So, one box of contacts costs $90.00 after the discount.

Now, if Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost is:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 contacts, so 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

If Pete uses one pair of contacts per day, 180 contacts will last for:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ contacts}}{2 \text{ contacts per pair}} = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

To find the cost per pair of contacts, we divide the total cost by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

So, the cost per pair of contacts is $2.00.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many hours Jill worked. She worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday. So, the total hours Jill worked is:
\[ 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we calculate how many hours John worked. John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours on Saturday} \]
And John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so:
\[ 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ hours on Sunday} \]
Adding these together, the total hours John worked is:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we calculate the money they earned. Since they both earn $10 per hour, Jill's earnings are:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars} \]
And John's earnings are:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings:
\[ 70 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John earned $40 more than Jill. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Hannah burns calories during her workout:
- She does aerobics for 2 hours, and each hour burns 500 calories. So, 2 hours will burn \(2 \times 500 = 1000\) calories.
- She also runs for 1 hour, and each hour burns 600 calories. So, 1 hour will burn \(1 \times 600 = 600\) calories.

Now, let's add up the total calories burned:
- Total calories burned = 1000 calories (from aerobics) + 600 calories (from running) = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, we need to find out how many 200-calorie portions are in 1600 calories:
- Number of 200-calorie portions in 1600 calories = \( \frac{1600}{200} = 8 \).

Since each 200-calorie portion requires 100 ml of water, 8 portions will require:
- Total water needed = 8 portions \(\times\) 100 ml/portion = 800 ml.

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{800}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500. The note says there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans and 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans.

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is \( B \).

- The number of red jelly beans is 1% less than blue jelly beans, so it's \( 0.99B \).
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than blue jelly beans, so it's \( 1.01B \).

The total number of jelly beans is the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combine the terms:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
- Red jelly beans: \( 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \)
- Green jelly beans: \( 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \)

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

So, there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jared starts with a typing speed of 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons, his speed increases to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his speed by 5 WPM, his new speed will be 57 WPM.

Now, we need to find the average of his three speeds: 47 WPM, 52 WPM, and 57 WPM.

First, we add these three speeds together:
\[ 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 \]

Next, we divide the total by 3 to find the average:
\[ \frac{156}{3} = 52 \]

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

The final answer is \(\boxed{52}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

If Martin eats Cheerios every day, he loses 1.25 pounds each week. Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss would be:
\[ 1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \]

If Martin eats donuts every day, he gains 1.75 pounds each week. Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain would be:
\[ 1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \]

To find out how much more he weighs after 5 weeks if he eats donuts instead of Cheerios, we subtract the weight loss from the weight gain:
\[ 8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is 2.5 pounds. Martin would weigh 2.5 pounds more if he eats donuts."
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Alex starts by inviting 100 people. Each of these 100 people invites 2 friends, so that's 100 times 2, which equals 200 friends. Then, Alex calls 10 of her friends, and 8 of them bring their spouses. So, we add Alex herself, the 100 people she invited, the 200 friends, the 10 friends she called, and the 8 spouses. 

So, the total is:
1 (Alex) + 100 (initial invitees) + 200 (friends invited by initial invitees) + 10 (friends Alex called) + 8 (spouses) = 319 people.

Therefore, Alex will need \(\boxed{319}\) seats."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler numbers to understand it better.

1. The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
2. The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so:
   \[
   10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]
3. The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so:
   \[
   20 \div 4 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
4. The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so:
   \[
   5 \times 44 = 220 \text{ pounds}

So, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds. The final answer is \(\boxed{220}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much the boots cost on each website and then add the shipping cost.

On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and the shipping is $4. So, the total cost on Amazon is:
\[ 16 + 4 = 20 \]

On eBay, the boots cost $13 and the shipping is twice as much as on Amazon. Since the shipping on Amazon is $4, the shipping on eBay is:
\[ 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

So, the total cost on eBay is:
\[ 13 + 8 = 21 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon. We do this by subtracting the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:
\[ 21 - 20 = 1 \]

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To figure out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we can start by noting the initial height of the beanstalk and how it grows each day.

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles its height every day. Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground.

Let's look at the height of the beanstalk each day:

- Day 0: 4 feet
- Day 1: 4 feet * 2 = 8 feet
- Day 2: 8 feet * 2 = 16 feet
- Day 3: 16 feet * 2 = 32 feet

On Day 3, the beanstalk reaches 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet height of Mark's window.

So, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

We know that 100 grams of mushrooms have 3 grams of protein. John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. We need to find out how many grams of protein he gets in a week.

First, let's find out how much protein is in 200 grams of mushrooms. Since 100 grams have 3 grams of protein, then 200 grams will have twice as much protein because 200 is twice 100. So, we calculate:

\[ 3 \text{ grams of protein} \times 2 = 6 \text{ grams of protein} \]

John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, so in one day, he gets 6 grams of protein. Now, we need to find out how much protein he gets in a week. There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the protein he gets in one day by 7:

\[ 6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week} \]

So, John gets 42 grams of protein per week. The answer is 42 grams."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. If we let Jerry's current age be \( J \), then 5 years ago he was \( J - 5 \) years old. According to the problem, his current age is twice his age 5 years ago, so we can write the equation:

\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

Now, let's solve this equation:

\[ J = 2J - 10 \]

Subtract \( J \) from both sides:

\[ 0 = J - 10 \]

Add 10 to both sides:

\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. To find out how old he will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

\[ 10 + 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

George needs to pay for dental work that costs $4500 in total. He has already put down a $600 deposit, so he still needs to pay:
\[ 4500 - 600 = 3900 \text{ dollars} \]

He makes $15 per hour at work. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $3900, we divide the remaining amount by his hourly wage:
\[ \frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours} \]

So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{260} \]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle \( x \). According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it's \( 2x \), and another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it's \( 3x \).

So, we can write the equation for the sum of the angles as:
\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 6:
\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

And the angle that is three times the smallest angle is:
\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees. 

Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Colby has different types of coins:
- Quarters: 8 quarters * 25 cents = 200 cents
- Dimes: 6 dimes * 10 cents = 60 cents
- Nickels: 14 nickels * 5 cents = 70 cents
- Pennies: 15 pennies * 1 cent = 15 cents

Now, let's add up all the cents:
200 cents (from quarters) + 60 cents (from dimes) + 70 cents (from nickels) + 15 cents (from pennies) = 345 cents

Each gumball costs 5 cents. To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we divide the total amount of money by the cost of one gumball:
345 cents / 5 cents/gumball = 69 gumballs

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs. The final answer is 69."
"To find out the total number of legs in the pet store, we need to count the legs of each type of pet and then add them up.

- Each dog has 4 legs, and there are 5 dogs, so the dogs have \(5 \times 4 = 20\) legs.
- Each cat has 4 legs, and there are 2 cats, so the cats have \(2 \times 4 = 8\) legs.
- Each bird has 2 legs, and there are 10 birds, so the birds have \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
\[20 \text{ (from dogs)} + 8 \text{ (from cats)} + 20 \text{ (from birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}\]

So, the total number of legs in the pet store is 48. The correct answer is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight. He increases this by 50%, so we calculate 50% of 8 pounds:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.50 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding this to the original 8 pounds:

\[ 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than the 12-pound weight he just calculated:

\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the weight he now uses is 10 pounds. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for each year.

**Year 1:**
- Steve starts with 5 games.
- He buys 1 game each month for 12 months, so he buys 12 games.
- Total games after Year 1: 5 (initial) + 12 (bought) = 17 games.
- He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so he has 17 + 5 = 22 games.

**Year 2:**
- He starts with 22 games.
- He buys 2 games each month for 12 months, so he buys 24 games.
- Total games after Year 2: 22 (from Year 1) + 24 (bought) = 46 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so he has 46 + 5 = 51 games.

**Year 3:**
- He starts with 51 games.
- He buys 4 games each month for 12 months, so he buys 48 games.
- Total games after Year 3: 51 (from Year 2) + 48 (bought) = 99 games.
- He gets 5 games for Christmas, so he has 99 + 5 = 104 games.

So, after 3 years, Steve has **104 games**."
"To solve this, we first need to find out how fast the plane is traveling. If the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate its speed by dividing the distance by the time:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we want to know how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

So, it would take 5 additional hours to travel the extra 2000 miles. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide 120 by 2:

\[ 120 \div 2 = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

So, Ruiz makes 60 pounds of chocolates in one hour.

Next, we need to find out how much Marissa makes in one hour. The problem says Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as much as Ruiz in one hour. So we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \]

Now, if they both work for 12 hours, we can find out how much Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[ 60 \times 12 = 720 \text{ pounds} \]

And how much Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[ 45 \times 12 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the total amount of chocolates they make together, we add the amounts Ruiz and Marissa make:

\[ 720 + 540 = 1260 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is 1260 pounds. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{1260}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Howard spent $8 on Monday. On Tuesday, he spent twice as much as he did on Monday, so:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

On Wednesday, he spent 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday, so:
\[ 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the money he spent over the three days:
\[ 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars} \]

Howard originally had $100. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the total amount he spent from his original amount:
\[ 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Howard has $12 left. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money Patrick earned.

First, we look at the first 4 hours:
- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.50.

So, for 4 hours, he sold:
\[ 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

The money he earned from these 4 hours is:
\[ 60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30.00 \]

Next, we look at the next 2 hours:
- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour.
- Each cup was sold for $0.60.

So, for 2 hours, he sold:
\[ 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

The money he earned from these 2 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12.00 \]

Now, we add the money he earned from both periods:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:
\[ \boxed{42} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that for every 2 miles, the tires rotate 725 times. Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. So, we need to find out how many rotations the tires make in a month.

To find out how many rotations per mile, we divide 725 by 2:
\[ \frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

Now, if Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, the total number of rotations in a month is:
\[ 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

Next, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations the tires can undergo by the number of rotations per month:
\[ \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert 72 months into years:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

So, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We know that 2 pumps give 120 washes. So, each pump gives:
   \[
   \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump}
   \]

2. The bottle costs $24.00, and this will give us 120 washes. So, the cost per wash is:
   \[
   \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
   \]

3. Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, 0.20 dollars is:
   \[
   0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ cents per wash}
   \]

4. Since each pump gives 60 washes, the cost of each pump is:
   \[
   60 \text{ washes per pump} \times 20 \text{ cents per wash} = 1200 \text{ cents}
   \]

So, the cost of each pump is 1200 cents. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{1200}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Joe has $50 to spend. The shirt he wants to buy is $25, but there's a 30% discount. So, the discount on the shirt is:
\[ 25 \times 0.30 = 7.50 \]
This means the shirt will cost:
\[ 25 - 7.50 = 17.50 \]

The shorts cost $35, and there's also a 30% discount on them. So, the discount on the shorts is:
\[ 35 \times 0.30 = 10.50 \]
This means the shorts will cost:
\[ 35 - 10.50 = 24.50 \]

Now, let's add the discounted prices of the shirt and the shorts:
\[ 17.50 + 24.50 = 42.00 \]

Joe started with $50, so after buying the outfit, he will have:
\[ 50 - 42.00 = 8.00 \]

So, the amount of money Joe will have left is $8.00. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. We know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. So, to find out how much butter he needs for 4 dozen croissants, we can do the following:

1. First, find out how much butter is needed for 1 dozen croissants: 1/4 pound.
2. Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants, we multiply the amount of butter needed for 1 dozen by 4:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} \times 4 \text{ dozen} = 1 \text{ pound}
   \]

So, Juan will need 1 pound of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

The final answer is \(\boxed{1}\) pound of butter."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first need to calculate the cost for each street.

For Monica's street:
- Length: 150 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

So, the cost for Monica's street is:
\[ 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 29100 \, \text{dollars} \]

For Lewis' street:
- Length: 490 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

So, the cost for Lewis' street is:
\[ 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 94860 \, \text{dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much more it costs for Lewis' street:
\[ 94860 \, \text{dollars} - 29100 \, \text{dollars} = 65760 \, \text{dollars} \]

So, it costs $65760 more to repave Lewis' street. The correct answer is:

\[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John gets $100,000 for the first 5 months. That's the easy part. Now, the research takes 10 times longer than the first 5 months, so it takes 10 * 5 = 50 months in total. The first 5 months are already covered by the $100,000, so the rest is 50 - 5 = 45 months.

For the 45 months after the first 5 months, each month costs 50% more than the initial $20,000. So, each month costs $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000.

Now, to find out how much money is needed for the 45 months, we multiply $30,000 by 45:
$30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.

So, the total cost is the initial $100,000 plus the $1,350,000 for the 45 months:
$100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Therefore, the total cost of John's research is $1,450,000."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
2. The second player ate beef tips, and each tip was 1 ounce. There were 8 tips, so that's \(8 \times 1 = 8\) ounces.
3. The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is 16 ounces, that's 16 ounces.
4. The fourth and fifth players ate vegetarian meals, so they didn't eat any meat.

Now, we add up the meat they ate:
\[6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}\]

So, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces. The correct answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find out how many posts the group will have in March, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of days in March:** March has 31 days.
2. **Calculate the total number of posts per day by all members:** Each of the 1000 members posts an average of 3 times a day.
3. **Find the total number of posts in March:** Multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March.

Let's do the math:

1. Number of days in March = 31
2. Total posts per day = Number of members × Average posts per member per day = 1000 × 3 = 3000 posts per day
3. Total posts in March = Total posts per day × Number of days in March = 3000 × 31 = 93000 posts

So, the total number of posts in March is 93,000. 

The correct answer is 93,000."
"To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how many loads of laundry Gary does in a year. Since he does laundry twice a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the total number of loads as follows:
\[ 2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year} \]

Next, we know that each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water. So, the total amount of water used in a year is:
\[ 104 \text{ loads/year} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \]

Now, we need to find out how much it costs to use 2080 gallons of water. We know that a gallon of water costs $0.15, so the total cost is:
\[ 2080 \text{ gallons/year} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars/year} \]

So, Gary spends $312 on water for laundry in a year. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me break it down step by step for clarity.

First, we have the aquarium which costs $10.00.

Next, Scarlett bought 2 bags of rocks at $2.50 each. So, the cost for the rocks is:
\[ 2 \times 2.50 = 5.00 \]

Then, she bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 each. So, the cost for the coral is:
\[ 3 \times 2.00 = 6.00 \]

She also bought 20 fish at $0.50 each. So, the cost for the fish is:
\[ 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \]

Lastly, she bought fish food for $2.00.

Now, let's add all these costs together:
\[ 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 10.00 + 2.00 = 33.00 \]

So, Scarlett spent a total of $33.00."

So, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall. 

The final answer is: 10 inches."
"To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to do a few calculations.

Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour and he works 10 hours a day. So, the total amount of meat he sells in one day is:
\[ 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day} \]

Bill gave Prince a bull that weighs 750 kg. To find out how many days it will take to sell all the meat from the bull, we divide the total weight of the bull's meat by the amount of meat Prince can sell in one day:
\[ \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days} \]

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell the meat from Bill's bull. The answer is:

"Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out the total number of seats in the auditorium. There are 4 rows and each row has 18 seats.

\[
\text{Total seats} = 4 \times 18 = 72
\]

Next, we need to find out how many seats were occupied by the administrators. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.

\[
\text{Seats occupied by administrators} = \frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18
\]

Now, we subtract the seats occupied by the administrators from the total number of seats to find out how many seats are left.

\[
\text{Remaining seats} = 72 - 18 = 54
\]

Then, we find out how many of these remaining seats were occupied by the parents. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.

\[
\text{Seats occupied by parents} = \frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18
\]

Finally, we subtract the seats occupied by the parents from the remaining seats to find out how many seats were occupied by the students.

\[
\text{Seats occupied by students} = 54 - 18 = 36
\]

So, the number of students in the school auditorium is 36. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{36}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. At each intersection, there are 6 poles, and each pole has 4 street lights. So, the number of street lights at one intersection is:
   \[
   6 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 24 \text{ street lights}
   \]

2. Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights at all intersections is:
   \[
   24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights}
   \]

3. Out of these, 20 street lights are not working. So, the number of functioning street lights is:
   \[
   96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ non-functioning street lights} = 76 \text{ functioning street lights}
   \]

So, the total number of functioning street lights is 76."

"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Arianna has a garden with 10 rows of flowers, and each row has 20 flowers. So, the total number of flowers is:
\[ 10 \text{ rows} \times 20 \text{ flowers per row} = 200 \text{ flowers} \]

Now, we know that 4 out of every 5 flowers have bloomed. To find out how many flowers have bloomed, we calculate:
\[ \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160 \]

So, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ashley has an internet speed of 20 kilobytes per second (kb/s). We need to find out how fast she can download in megabytes per hour (Mb/h).

First, we convert kilobytes to megabytes. Since 1 megabyte (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobytes (kb), we can say that 20 kilobytes is:
\[ 20 \, \text{kb} = \frac{20}{1000} \, \text{Mb} = 0.02 \, \text{Mb} \]

Next, we need to find out how many megabytes she can download in one hour. There are 3600 seconds in one hour, so we multiply her speed in megabytes per second by 3600:
\[ 0.02 \, \text{Mb/s} \times 3600 \, \text{s/h} = 72 \, \text{Mb/h} \]

So, Ashley's internet connection speed in megabytes per hour is 72 Mb/h. 

The final answer is:
\[ 72 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for clarity.

First, we know the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days. So, for three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, for the remaining four days, it pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. So, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the four days. Therefore, for the four days, it pulled:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Now, to find the total number of cars pulled that week, we add the cars pulled in the first three days to the cars pulled in the remaining four days:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

So, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"
"To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to figure out the difference in his height and how much he grows each year.

Adam is currently 40 inches tall. The minimum height required to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet, which is 48 inches. So, Adam needs to grow:

\[ 48 \text{ inches} - 40 \text{ inches} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Adam grows 2 inches each year. To find out how many years it will take for him to grow 8 inches, we divide the needed growth by his yearly growth rate:

\[ 8 \text{ inches} \div 2 \text{ inches/year} = 4 \text{ years} \]

So, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000. So, the total cost of the cars is:
\[ 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000 \]

The company paid 30% of that price to get the cars, so the cost the company paid is:
\[ 30\% \times \$250,000 = 0.30 \times \$250,000 = \$75,000 \]

The profit James made is the total cost of the cars minus what the company paid:
\[ \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000 \]

James gets a 10% commission on the profits, so his commission is:
\[ 10\% \times \$175,000 = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500 \]

So, James made:
\[ \$17,500 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{17500} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 100 surfers in total.
2. When a wave over 30 feet comes, only 25% of the surfers can stay on the wave. So, we calculate 25% of 100:
   \[
   100 \times 0.25 = 25
   \]
   So, 25 surfers can stay on the wave.
3. Out of these 25 surfers, 60% are women. So, we calculate 60% of 25:
   \[
   25 \times 0.60 = 15
   \]
   So, 15 surfers are women.
4. The rest of the surfers are men. To find out how many men there are, we subtract the number of women from the total number of surfers who can stay on the wave:
   \[
   25 - 15 = 10
   \]
   So, 10 surfers are men.

Therefore, the number of men who can stay on the wave is 10. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the price of a diamond jewel is $2000. 

The price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600 \text{ dollars} \]

The price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel. So, we calculate:
\[ \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total price for all three jewels, we add their prices together:
\[ \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800. 

The correct answer is: **4800**"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought:
\[ 16 + 3 = 19 \text{ truck stamps} \]

He also bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought:
\[ 19 - 9 = 10 \text{ rose stamps} \]

Now, to find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add up all the stamps:
\[ 16 \text{ (snowflake)} + 19 \text{ (truck)} + 10 \text{ (rose)} = 45 \]

So, the total number of stamps Max bought is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To figure out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap.

First, let's find out how fast Tom is closing the gap. Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour, and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour. So, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of:

\[ 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, we know the gap is 75 miles, and Tom is closing this gap at a rate of 15 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So,

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Naomi caught 17 fish. According to the problem, Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. So, we can calculate how many fish Darren caught:

\[
\text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 = 11
\]

Next, the problem says that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can find out how many fish Tommy caught by adding 3 to the number of fish Darren caught:

\[
\text{Tommy's fish} = 11 + 3 = 14
\]

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{14}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Manny signed up for 10 karate classes that cost a total of $60. His parents will not sign him up for more classes if each class costs more than $10.

First, we need to find out the maximum cost per class if the total cost is $60 for 10 classes. We do this by dividing the total cost by the number of classes:

\[ \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \]

Since $6 is less than $10, the cost per class is within the limit. Now, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class goes over $10.

If Manny misses 6 classes, he will have 4 classes left. The total cost remains $60, but it's now for 4 classes. So, we calculate the new cost per class:

\[ \text{New cost per class} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

Since $15 is more than $10, his parents will not sign him up for more classes. Therefore, Manny can miss up to 6 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jewel processes 50 customers a day. Julie processes twice as many customers as Jewel, so she processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers a day.

Now, let's find out how many customers they process in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

For Jewel:
- Customers per day: 50
- Customers per week: \(50 \times 7 = 350\)

For Julie:
- Customers per day: 100
- Customers per week: \(100 \times 7 = 700\)

To find the total number of customers they process in a week, we add the customers processed by Jewel and Julie:
- Total customers per week: \(350 + 700 = 1050\)

So, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is 1050 customers. The correct answer is \(\boxed{1050}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, so:

\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. So, if we let the distance Lynn ran be \( L \), then:

\[ 20 = L + 3 \]

To find \( L \), we subtract 3 from both sides:

\[ L = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

So, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that four apples cost $5.20. To find out how much one apple costs, we divide $5.20 by 4:
\[ \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30 \]
So, one apple costs $1.30.

Next, we know that three oranges cost $3.30. To find out how much one orange costs, we divide $3.30 by 3:
\[ \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10 \]
So, one orange costs $1.10.

Now, we need to find out how much 5 apples and 5 oranges cost. We calculate the cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges separately and then add them together.

The cost for 5 apples is:
\[ 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50 \]

The cost for 5 oranges is:
\[ 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50 \]

Adding these together gives:
\[ 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00 \]

So, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges. The correct answer is \(\boxed{12.00}\)."
"To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole. The hole is shaped like a rectangular prism, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can calculate the volume as follows:

\[ \text{Volume} = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Now, we know it takes Bob 3 seconds to dig one cubic foot of earth. So, to find out the total time it takes to dig 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time it takes to dig one cubic foot:

\[ \text{Total time} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds} \]

So, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find the total cost of Bill's new truck.

First, we know the base price of the truck is $30,000.

Next, we add the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500.

Then, we need to find the cost of the leather seats. The problem states that the leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade. So, we calculate:
\[
\text{Cost of leather seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500
\]

After that, we need to find the cost of the running boards. The problem says the running boards are $500 less than the leather seats. So, we calculate:
\[
\text{Cost of running boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000
\]

Finally, we add the cost of the upgraded exterior light package, which is $1,500.

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 = 43,500
\]

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500."
"Okay, let me break it down for you in a simpler way.

Tim gets a raise of 5% on his $20,000 salary. So, his raise is:
\[ 20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000 \]
Adding this raise to his salary, his new monthly salary is:
\[ 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000 \]

Tim also gets a bonus that is half of his new salary, which is:
\[ \frac{21,000}{2} = 10,500 \]

So, his total monthly income is:
\[ 21,000 + 10,500 = 31,500 \]

Now, to find out how much he makes in a year, we multiply his total monthly income by 12:
\[ 31,500 \times 12 = 378,000 \]

So, Tim will make $378,000 in a year. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{378000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much everything cost.

First, we calculate the cost of the suits:
- James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750.
- So, the total cost for the suits is \(10 \times 750 = 7500\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the dress pants:
- The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of a suit. So, each pair of dress pants costs \(750 \div 5 = 150\) dollars.
- James buys 10 pairs of dress pants, so the total cost for the dress pants is \(10 \times 150 = 1500\) dollars.

Then, we calculate the cost of the dress shirts:
- James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit, and he has 10 suits, so he buys \(10 \times 3 = 30\) dress shirts.
- Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost for the dress shirts is \(30 \times 60 = 1800\) dollars.

Now, we add up all the costs:
- Cost of suits: $7500
- Cost of dress pants: $1500
- Cost of dress shirts: $1800

So, the total cost is \(7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800\) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost of everything is \(\boxed{10800}\) dollars."
"To find out the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we can break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate how many articles the news website publishes in February. The news website publishes an average of 20 articles every day, and February has 28 days. So, we multiply 20 by 28:
\[ 20 \times 28 = 560 \text{ articles} \]

Next, let's calculate how many articles the sister company publishes in February. The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles every day, and February also has 28 days. So, we multiply 10 by 28:
\[ 10 \times 28 = 280 \text{ articles} \]

Now, to find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we add the number of articles from each website:
\[ 560 + 280 = 840 \text{ articles} \]

So, the total number of articles the two websites published together in February is 840. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{840} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Steve is 60 years old.
2. His wife is 4 years older than him, so she is \(60 + 4 = 64\) years old.
3. Their son is half as old as his mom, so the son is \(64 \div 2 = 32\) years old.
4. Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is \(32 - 3 = 29\) years old.

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much flour is in one bag. The problem tells us that each bag is divided into 8 portions, and each portion weighs 2 kilograms. So, to find the total weight of flour in one bag, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion:

\[ 8 \text{ portions} \times 2 \text{ kilograms per portion} = 16 \text{ kilograms} \]

So, one bag contains 16 kilograms of flour.

Next, we need to find out how much flour is in three bags. Since we know one bag has 16 kilograms, we multiply that by 3:

\[ 16 \text{ kilograms} \times 3 = 48 \text{ kilograms} \]

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags is 48 kilograms.

The final answer is \(\boxed{48}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how far Alisa biked. She biked at a speed of 12 miles per hour for 4.5 hours. To find the distance, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

So, for Alisa:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4.5 \, \text{hours} \]

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 54 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate how far Stanley biked. He biked at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 2.5 hours. Using the same formula:

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2.5 \, \text{hours} \]

\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 25 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find the total distance both biked, we add the distances together:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} + \text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} \]

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 54 \, \text{miles} + 25 \, \text{miles} \]

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 79 \, \text{miles} \]

So, the total distance biked by Alisa and Stanley is 79 miles. 

The correct answer is 79 miles."
"To figure out how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time to dig through the soil:
- Bill digs at a rate of 4 feet per hour through soil.
- He needs to dig 24 feet of soil.
- Time to dig through soil = \(\frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

Next, let's calculate the time to dig through the clay:
- Bill digs at half the speed through clay, so he digs at a rate of 2 feet per hour through clay.
- He needs to dig 8 feet of clay.
- Time to dig through clay = \(\frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}\).

Now, we add the time to dig through the soil and the time to dig through the clay to get the total time:
- Total time = Time to dig through soil + Time to dig through clay
- Total time = 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well. The correct answer is 10 hours."
"To figure out how many cupcakes Howie should buy, we need to consider everyone in his class. He wants to get one vanilla and one chocolate cupcake for each person, including himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates.

So, the total number of people is:
\[ 1 \text{ (Howie)} + 1 \text{ (teacher)} + 25 \text{ (classmates)} = 27 \text{ people} \]

Each person gets 2 cupcakes (one vanilla and one chocolate), so:
\[ 27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes per person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes} \]

Therefore, Howie should buy 54 cupcakes. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Fishio's photo got 2000 likes after 1 week. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. So, we calculate the likes after 3 weeks:

\[ 70 \times 2000 = 140000 \]

This means that after 3 weeks, Fishio's photo had 140,000 likes. Then, she got 20,000 more likes recently. So, we add these 20,000 likes to the 140,000 likes she already had:

\[ 140000 + 20000 = 160000 \]

So, the total number of likes now is 160,000. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{160000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for clarity.

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. So, the total cost was:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]
She got a $2 discount, so the final cost was:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

The next day, the price of each pomegranate was $30, but there was a 10% discount on the total cost. First, we calculate the total cost without the discount:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]
Then, we apply the 10% discount:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Now, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

So, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Ariadne earned $400 from selling red hats. This amount is half of what she earned from selling green hats. So, if $400 is half of the green hat sales, then the total sales from green hats must be twice that amount.

\[ \text{Green hat sales} = 400 \times 2 = 800 \]

So, in the first month, Ariadne earned $400 from red hats and $800 from green hats. The total for the first month is:

\[ \text{Total first month} = 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, we calculate 3/4 of $1200:

\[ \text{Second month sales} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

Now, to find out how much she made in total over the two months, we add the total sales of the first month and the second month:

\[ \text{Total two months} = 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

So, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is $2100. 

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{2100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is 4 hours in total. But he gets 1 hour for free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost for the first hour is $15. The second hour is twice that, so it's $30. The third hour is twice the second hour, so it's $60.

Now, let's add up the costs:
- First hour: $15
- Second hour: $30
- Third hour: $60

So, the total cost is $15 + $30 + $60 = $105.

Therefore, the amount James paid is $105."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Sally's bank account started with $200 and now has $420. This means she earned an extra $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

Her weekly wage should be $300. To find out how much was taken away, we subtract her weekly wage from the extra money she earned:

$220 - $300 = -$80

Since we got a negative number, it means $80 was taken away from her wage. So, the amount withheld from Sally’s wage is $80.

The correct answer is: **$80**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves. If each guest eats 3 deviled egg halves, then each guest needs:

\[ 3 \text{ deviled egg halves/guest} \div 2 \text{ deviled egg halves/whole egg} = 1.5 \text{ whole eggs/guest} \]

Since she's inviting 16 guests, the total number of whole eggs needed is:

\[ 16 \text{ guests} \times 1.5 \text{ whole eggs/guest} = 24 \text{ whole eggs} \]

Now, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs she needs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of whole eggs by 12:

\[ 24 \text{ whole eggs} \div 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 2 \text{ dozen eggs} \]

So, Lori will need 2 dozen eggs. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Shiela needs to write a 15-page research paper. She has already written 1/3 of it. To find out how many pages she has written, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages}
\]

So, she has written 5 pages. To find out how many pages she still needs to write, we subtract the pages she has already written from the total number of pages:

\[
15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages}
\]

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}

"Mike's teacher gave him a homework to read a 200-page book. He plans to read 10 pages every day. To find out how many days it will take him to finish the book, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each day:

\[ \text{Total pages} = 200 \]
\[ \text{Pages per day} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Total days required} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days} \]

Now, if the assignment is due in 30 days, we need to find out how many days before the deadline he will finish his reading:

\[ \text{Deadline} = 30 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Days required} = 20 \text{ days} \]
\[ \text{Days before deadline} = 30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days} \]

So, Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To find out how much it cost James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to add the cost of the plane to the total cost of renting the hanger and fuel for a year.

First, let's calculate the total cost for renting the hanger and fuel for a year:
- James pays $5,000 a month to rent the hanger.
- He spends twice that amount on fuel, so he spends $10,000 a month on fuel.
- So, his total monthly cost is $5,000 + $10,000 = $15,000.
- For a year, that would be $15,000 * 12 = $180,000.

Now, we add the cost of the plane to the yearly cost of renting and fueling:
- The plane cost $150,000.
- So, the total cost for the first year is $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000.

Therefore, the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $330,000.

The correct answer is: **$330,000**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know it took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. Now, we need to find out how long it took to cook pork and beans.

1. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice. So, if rice took 30 minutes, pork took:
   \[
   30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. First, we find the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
   \[
   30 + 50 = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Then, beans took half of that time:
   \[
   \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we add up the time for all the food:
\[
30 \text{ (rice)} + 50 \text{ (pork)} + 40 \text{ (beans)} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time it took to cook all the food is 120 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]"
"To find out how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, let's break it down step by step.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- So, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

Now, we find the difference in cost between the two mixtures:
- The difference is \( 10 - 7 = 3 \) dollars.

So, the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs 3 dollars more than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts. The final answer is 3 dollars."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We know that:
- Sheep have 4 legs and 1 head.
- Geese have 2 legs and 1 head.
- The total number of heads is 20.
- The total number of legs is 70.

First, let's say there are \( S \) sheep and \( G \) geese. We can write two equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of heads:
\[ S + G = 20 \]

2. The total number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 70 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now we have a system of equations:
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

To solve this, we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

So, the number of sheep \( S \) is 15.

To verify, let's find the number of geese \( G \):
\[ S + G = 20 \]
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, let's check the number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Roger usually buys coffee for $5 per pound. But since the normal brand was sold out, he had to buy the more expensive one that costs 20% more. So, the more expensive coffee costs $5 + ($5 * 20%) = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger needs 1 pound of coffee per day and he's buying for a week, so he needs 7 pounds of coffee. At $6 per pound, the total cost for the coffee is 7 pounds * $6/pound = $42.

He also buys a donut for $2. So, the total cost is $42 (coffee) + $2 (donut) = $44.

So, the total cost is $44. The answer is C."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store. He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each, which is $2.00 x 2 = $4.00. He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00. So, the total cost of these items is $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00.

Since Gus spent a total of $20.00, the cost of the apple pie is the total amount minus the cost of the other items. So, $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00.

Therefore, the apple pie cost $7.00."
"To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers delivered to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers delivered in a day.

The total number of newspapers delivered in a day is 600.

The number of newspapers delivered to District A is 198.

The number of newspapers delivered to District C is 209.

So, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - (198 + 209) \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - 407 \]

\[ \text{Newspapers to District B} = 193 \]

Therefore, the number of newspapers James delivers to District B is 193."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

John takes a cooking class that meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time. The class lasts for 6 weeks. We need to find out how many new recipes he learns if he learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours of class time.

First, let's calculate the total number of class hours John attends:
- He has 4 classes each week.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- The class lasts for 6 weeks.

So, the total class hours are:
\[ 4 \text{ classes/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we need to find out how many recipes he learns. He learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours of class time. So, we divide the total class hours by the time it takes to learn one recipe:
\[ \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes} \]

So, John learns 32 recipes. The answer is 32."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 150 teachers in total. If 60% of them are history teachers, we can find out how many history teachers there are by calculating 60% of 150:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90 \]

So, there are 90 history teachers. The rest of the teachers are math teachers, so we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers to find out how many math teachers there are:

\[ 150 - 90 = 60 \]

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find out the total time all the math teachers spend sleeping in one day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps:

\[ 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{360}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know that Aurelia has $120. Kassidy has \(\frac{3}{4}\) of what Aurelia has, so:

\[
\text{Kassidy's money} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, so:

\[
\text{Rayna's money} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, let's add up all their money:

\[
\text{Total money} = 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

If they share this money equally among the three of them, each person would get:

\[
\text{Each person's share} = \frac{360}{3} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, each person would have $120. The correct answer is:

"To find out how long the entire game lasted, we need to add up the time for all the quarters.

Each quarter is 12 minutes long, and there are 4 quarters in total. So, the time for the first three quarters is:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

In the last quarter, the game was extended by 5 minutes because of a tie. So, the last quarter was:
\[ 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for the first three quarters to the time for the last quarter:
\[ 36 + 17 = 53 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the entire game lasted 53 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{53} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have a company with 50 employees. 20% of these employees are management. To find out how many that is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 management employees. Out of these 10 management employees, only 30% oversee the entire company. To find out how many of these 10 management employees oversee the company:

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 10 = \frac{30}{100} \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \]

So, the number of employees who oversee the company is 3. 

The final answer is: **3**"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Adam bought 7 candies of type A, and each costs $0.5. So, the total cost for type A candies is:
\[ 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5 \]

He also bought 10 candies of type B, and each costs $0.75. So, the total cost for type B candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \]

Now, we add the costs of both types of candies to find the total cost:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change he got, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \]

So, the change Adam got is $4.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Christina recorded her moods over 30 days. We know:
- She had 12 good days.
- She had 8 bad days.
- The rest were neutral days.

First, we calculate the number of neutral days:
\[ 30 - 12 - 8 = 10 \text{ neutral days} \]

Next, we look at how the days were distributed:
- The first 8 days were good.
- The next 8 days were bad.
- The last 8 days were neutral.

Then, we add the next three days:
- Day 29 and Day 30 were neutral.
- Day 31 was good.

Now, let's count the good days:
- First 8 days: 8 good days
- Next 8 days: 0 good days
- Last 8 days: 0 good days
- Next 3 days: 1 good day (Day 29) + 1 good day (Day 31) = 2 good days

Adding these up:
\[ 8 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 10 \text{ good days} \]

Christina had 12 good days in total. So, the number of good days left is:
\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \]

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Janey has 21 books, and she has 3 more than twice the number of books Sally has. So, if we let the number of books Sally has be \( S \), then Janey's books can be written as \( 2S + 3 \).

Since Janey has 21 books, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To find out how many books Sally has, we need to solve this equation. First, we subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:
\[ S = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

So, Sally has 9 books. The answer is 9."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how tall the bamboo is in inches. It's currently 20 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can calculate the current height in inches:

\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we want to know how many more inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. So, we subtract the current height from the target height:

\[ 600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches} \]

The bamboo grows 30 inches every day. To find out how many days it will take to grow 360 inches, we divide the total inches needed by the daily growth rate:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches. The final answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James starts with 4 toys for 4 dogs.
2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now, so he needs 8 more toys to have one toy per dog. So, he needs 8 toys.
3. After buying the toys, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. When he left, there were 4 dogs, so twice as many more dogs means there are \(2 \times 4 = 8\) more dogs. This makes the total number of dogs \(4 + 8 = 12\).
4. Now, he needs 12 toys because there are 12 dogs.
5. When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needed those toys. This means he now has 12 - 3 = 9 dogs in the shelter.
6. Since he needs 1 toy per dog, he needs 9 toys now.

Adding up all the toys he needs:
- Initially, he needed 8 toys.
- After buying the toys, he needed 12 toys.
- When he came back again, he needed 9 toys.

So, the total number of toys James needs is \(8 + 12 + 9 = 29\).

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's go through the problem step by step again, but in a simpler way.

1. **Initial Investment:**
   The total amount is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment:**
   Dylan invested \(\frac{2}{5}\) of $1200.
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2 \times 1200}{5} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]
   So, Dylan invested $480.

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment:**
   After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:
   \[
   1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. **Frances's Investment:**
   Frances invested \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the remaining $720.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. To find out how many hash browns we can get from 96 potatoes, we first figure out how many hash browns we get from 1 potato. 

If 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, then:
\[ \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} \]

Now, if we have 96 potatoes, we can calculate the total number of hash browns by multiplying the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns per potato:
\[ \text{Hash browns from 96 potatoes} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns} \]

So, the number of hash browns we can make from 96 potatoes is 576. 

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The elevator can support a maximum of 700 kg. Jack is 80 kg and there are 8 other adults, each weighing 80 kg. So, the total weight of the 8 adults is:

\[ 8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ kg} \]

Now, we add Jack's weight to the total weight of the adults:

\[ 80 \text{ kg} + 640 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg} \]

The elevator can only support 700 kg, so we need to find out how much more than 700 kg they are:

\[ 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg} \]

So, they will exceed the maximum load by 20 kg. The correct answer is:

\[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Katarina has 68 cookies. The problem tells us that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. So, if Katarina has 68 cookies, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies.

Next, we know Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, if Max has 73 cookies, the Cookie Monster must have 73 - 12 = 61 cookies.

Finally, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. So, if Max has 73 cookies, Summer must have 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

Now, to find out how many cookies they all have in total, we add up the cookies each person has:
- Katarina: 68 cookies
- Max: 73 cookies
- Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
- Summer: 96 cookies

Adding these together: 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 cookies.

"To find the original length of the dress, let's break it down step by step.

Shania extends the dress by 50% of its original length and adds 20 cm to the bottom. The final length of the dress is 140 cm. We can set up the equation to find the original length:

\[ \text{Original length} + 0.5 \times \text{Original length} + 20 = 140 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 1.5 \times \text{Original length} + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\[ 1.5 \times \text{Original length} = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

\[ \text{Original length} = \frac{120}{1.5} \]

\[ \text{Original length} = 80 \]

So, the original length of the dress was 80 cm. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{80} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Chris can mow his lawn in 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) when he's using the turtle mode. In rabbit mode, he can mow the lawn in 40 minutes.

If he mows half of the lawn in turtle mode and the other half in rabbit mode, we need to find out how long it takes for each half.

For the half he mows in turtle mode:
- Since 1 hour (60 minutes) is for the whole lawn, half of that would be 30 minutes.

For the half he mows in rabbit mode:
- Since 40 minutes is for the whole lawn, half of that would be 20 minutes.

Now, we add the time for each half to find the total time:
- 30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes.

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the entire lawn. The correct answer is 50 minutes."
"John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school together. It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. To find out how much longer they have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time they've already spent from the total time they have.

First, we add the time it takes to get to the fire station from the time it takes to get to the corner:
\[ 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes} \]

They have a total of 30 minutes, so we subtract the 19 minutes they've already spent from the total time:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there is one twin and one set of triplets. Let's say the age of the twin is \( T \) and the age of one of the triplets is \( Tr \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = Tr + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( T + T + Tr + Tr + Tr = 44 \).

This simplifies to:
\[ 2T + 3Tr = 44 \]

Now, we substitute the first piece of information into the second equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now that we know \( Tr = 6 \), we can find \( T \):
\[ T = Tr + 7 \]
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

So, one of the twins is 13 years old. The final answer is 13."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John has to do his homework first. He has 20 minutes for math, 40 minutes for reading, and 20 minutes for history. So, we add these times together:

20 minutes (math) + 40 minutes (reading) + 20 minutes (history) = 80 minutes

John has 3 hours before dinner. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Now, we subtract the time John spends on his homework from the time he has before dinner:

180 minutes (before dinner) - 80 minutes (homework) = 100 minutes

So, John has 100 minutes left to take a nap. 

The correct answer is 100 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Manolo bought five lollipops and four candies for $3.20. Each lollipop costs $0.40, so the total cost for the lollipops is:
\[ 5 \times 0.40 = 2.00 \]

This means the total cost for the four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

So, each candy costs:
\[ \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Now, we want to find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies would cost. The cost for 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

And the cost for 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

So, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost is $7.00."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Rong saves 20 coins every month. Neil saves 2/5 more coins than Rong each month. So, we first need to find out how many coins Neil saves each month.

Neil saves:
\[ 20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month} \]

Now, we need to find out how many coins they save in 10 years. There are 12 months in a year, so in 10 years, there are:
\[ 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months} \]

In 120 months, Rong saves:
\[ 20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins} \]

In 120 months, Neil saves:
\[ 28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins} \]

So, the total number of coins they save together in 10 years is:
\[ 2400 + 3360 = 5760 \text{ coins} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5760} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. So, the cost for the vaccines is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, the heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill. Let's say the total bill is \( T \). Then the cost of the heartworm check is \( 0.6T \).

The total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:
\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

To find \( T \), we need to solve this equation. First, let's isolate \( T \) on one side:
\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} \]
\[ T = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, John leaves with $25. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"To find the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then add them up.

First, let's find the cost of each fruit:
- One apple costs $0.5.
- One banana costs twice as much as an apple, so it costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
- One orange costs three times as much as a banana, so it costs \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit in the crate:
- The crate has 5 bananas, so the cost for bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).
- The crate has 12 apples, so the cost for apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).
- The crate has 7 oranges, so the cost for oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

Finally, we add up the costs of all the fruits to get the total price of the crate:
\[5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0\]

So, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32.0}\)."
"To find out how many square feet Brittany's comforter is, we need to add up all the squares of different colors and then find the total area.

First, we know there are 14 red squares.

Next, we calculate the number of blue squares. The problem states there are 4 more blue squares than red squares. So, we add 4 to the number of red squares:
\[ 14 + 4 = 18 \]
So, there are 18 blue squares.

Then, we calculate the number of green squares. The problem says there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, we add 6 to the number of blue squares:
\[ 18 + 6 = 24 \]
So, there are 24 green squares.

Finally, we calculate the number of white squares. The problem states there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. So, we subtract 12 from the number of green squares:
\[ 24 - 12 = 12 \]
So, there are 12 white squares.

Now, we add up all the squares to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[ 14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68 \text{ squares} \]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, each square has an area of 1 square foot. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is:
\[ 68 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{68} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending the function. So, the total number of people is:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \]

The restaurant has 8 high chairs. It's given that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. So, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

Now, we add the regular chairs and the high chairs to find out how many chairs are available:

\[ 40 + 8 = 48 \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs available from the total number of people:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

So, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We start with 50 deer in the field. If 50 percent of them are bucks, we calculate the number of bucks as follows:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.50 \times 50 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 bucks. Now, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, so we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8 point bucks is 5. 

The final answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how many points the class is missing.

First, we know Adam has collected 50 points. Betty collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points Betty collected, we calculate:
\[ 30\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \]
So, Betty collected:
\[ 50 + 15 = 65 \text{ points} \]

Next, Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom. Tom has 30 points, so:
\[ \text{Points collected by Marta} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ points} \]

Now, let's add up all the points collected by Adam, Betty, Marta, and Tom:
\[ 50 + 65 + 90 + 30 = 235 \text{ points} \]

The class needs a total of 400 points to go on the trip. To find out how many points they are missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:
\[ 400 - 235 = 165 \text{ points} \]

So, the class is missing \(\boxed{165}\) points to go on the trip."
"Great Grandma Jones has three children. Each of her children has three children of their own, which are Great Grandma Jones' grandchildren. And each of these grandchildren has three babies of their own, who are Great Grandma Jones' great grand-babies.

So, we need to find out how many great grand-babies there are. Here's how we can figure it out:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.
2. Each of her 3 children has 3 grandchildren.
   - So, the total number of grandchildren is \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
3. Each of these 9 grandchildren has 3 great grand-babies.
   - So, the total number of great grand-babies is \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the number of great grand-babies at the family reunion is 27.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Greta's paycheck is $2400.00. She puts 50% of her pay into her retirement account. So, we calculate 50% of $2400.00:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 2400 = 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

So, she puts $1200 into her retirement account. Now, we subtract this from her total paycheck:

\[ 2400 - 1200 = 1200 \]

Next, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her monthly car payment. We calculate 20% of $2400.00:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 2400 = 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

So, she spends $480 on her car payment. Now, we subtract this from the remaining amount after putting money into her retirement account:

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

So, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720.00.

The final answer is $720.00."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the box can hold 20 pencils, but 4 are missing. So, we need to find out how many pencils are actually in the box.

1. Subtract the missing pencils from the total capacity:
   \[
   20 - 4 = 16
   \]
   So, there are 16 pencils in the box.

2. Now, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils there are. Since each pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2:
   \[
   16 \div 2 = 8
   \]

So, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box. The final answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many fireworks are in the display. The city is setting off 15 boxes of fireworks, and each box contains 20 fireworks. So, we multiply 15 by 20:

\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \]

That means there are 300 fireworks in total.

Next, we need to figure out how many of these fireworks Hannah can see. The problem says she can see 40% of the fireworks. To find 40% of 300, we do:

\[ 0.40 \times 300 = 120 \]

So, Hannah can see 120 fireworks from the display.

Now, we also need to add the fireworks she sets off in her backyard. She sets off 3 boxes of fireworks, and each box has 5 fireworks. So, we multiply 3 by 5:

\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

This means she sets off 15 fireworks in her backyard.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah sees, we add the fireworks from the display to the fireworks she sets off:

\[ 120 + 15 = 135 \]

So, the total number of fireworks Hannah sees is 135. 

The final answer is \(\boxed{135}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema, so that's 13 people. Then they meet up with 7 more friends. So the total number of people is:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Each person needs a seat, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks. So, the total number of drinks and snacks needed is:

\[ 20 \text{ people} \times (2 \text{ drinks} + 3 \text{ snacks}) = 20 \times 5 = 100 \]

Each drink and each snack costs $2. So, the total cost for the drinks and snacks is:

\[ 100 \text{ items} \times 2 \text{ dollars per item} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the group has spent a total of $200 on drinks and snacks. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

\[ 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we know the total capacity of all three trucks together is 11,600 pounds. If we add Gissela's and Gordy's truck capacities together, we get:

\[ 4000 + 4800 = 8800 \text{ pounds} \]

To find out how much Gary's truck can haul, we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:

\[ 11600 - 8800 = 2800 \text{ pounds} \]

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{2800} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

We know there are 8 males and 6 females. Each female ate 3 dumplings. So, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male ate:
\[ 3 + 1 = 4 \text{ dumplings} \]

Now, we need to find out how many dumplings the males ate in total:
\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \]

To find the total number of dumplings cooked, we add the dumplings eaten by the females and the males:
\[ 18 + 32 = 50 \]

So, Larry cooked a total of 50 dumplings. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. This means for every 5 parts, Gerald gets 3 parts and Julia gets 2 parts.

First, we need to find out how much each part is worth. Since the total is $100 and there are 5 parts, each part is worth:
\[ \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Now, we calculate how much Gerald got. Since he got 3 parts, he got:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]

Gerald spent $10 on a book, so the money he has left is:
\[ 60 - 10 = 50 \]

So, the amount of money Gerald has left is $50. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the cat can run 15 feet per second. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing 15 feet per second by 5.

So, the turtle's speed is:
\[ 15 \div 5 = 3 \text{ feet per second} \]

Now, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

Substituting the turtle's speed and the time:
\[ \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet} \]

So, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To solve this, we need to figure out how many more hours the firefighters need to work to reach their goal of $6300. They've already raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. 

First, let's find out how much they raise each hour. They raised $2100 in 3 hours, so:
\[ \text{Amount raised per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Now, we need to find out how much more money they need to raise to reach $6300:
\[ \text{Remaining amount needed} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

Since they raise $700 each hour, we can find out how many more hours they need to work by dividing the remaining amount by the amount they raise per hour:
\[ \text{Additional hours needed} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

So, they need to work for 6 more hours. Adding the initial 3 hours:
\[ \text{Total hours needed} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they have to work to reach their goal is 9. The correct answer is:
\[ 9 \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. Out of the 40% that Colorado City uses, 80% is used for industrial purposes. So, we calculate 80% of 40%:
   \[
   0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 = 32\%
   \]
   So, 32% of the total water from the Colorado River is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City.
3. To find out what percentage of the total water is used for non-industrial purposes, we subtract the industrial usage from the total usage:
   \[
   40\% - 32\% = 8\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is 8%.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}

\[ 14 \times 12 = 168 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring. The correct answer is:
\[ 168 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much ice cream the factory makes in one hour.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- So, in 1 hour, they make \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- So, in 1 hour, they make \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).

Now, we want to know how much ice cream they make in 48 hours.

For chocolate ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream in 48 hours:
- \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Adding these together:
- \( 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \).

So, the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is 3000 quarts. The correct answer is 3000 quarts."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out Marcus' total bill.

First, we calculate the cost of each type of baked good:

1. For the croissants: 5 croissants at $3.00 each.
\[ 5 \times 3.00 = 15.00 \]

2. For the cinnamon rolls: 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each.
\[ 4 \times 2.50 = 10.00 \]

3. For the mini quiches: 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each.
\[ 3 \times 4.00 = 12.00 \]

4. For the blueberry muffins: 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each.
\[ 13 \times 1.00 = 13.00 \]

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total cost before the discount:
\[ 15.00 + 10.00 + 12.00 + 13.00 = 50.00 \]

Marcus has a loyalty card that gives him a 10% discount on his total purchase. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate 10% of $50.00:
\[ 0.10 \times 50.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the discount amount is $5.00. We subtract this discount from the total cost to get the final bill:
\[ 50.00 - 5.00 = 45.00 \]

Therefore, Marcus' total bill is $45.00."
"The ice cream parlor has a deal where you get 1 scoop free for every 2 scoops you buy. Each scoop costs $1.50. Erin has $6.00 to spend.

To figure out how many scoops she can get, let's see how much 3 scoops cost. Since 3 scoops include 2 scoops she pays for and 1 scoop that's free, the cost is:
\[ 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \]

Erin has $6.00, so we can see how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy:
\[ \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \]

This means Erin can buy 2 sets of 3 scoops, which totals:
\[ 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops} \]

So, Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream. The correct answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of candy. Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, and Amy eats 3 pieces a day. We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

First, let's calculate how many days are in two weeks:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

Next, we calculate how much candy Ginger eats in 14 days:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces} \]

Then, we calculate how much candy Amy eats in 14 days:
\[ 3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we find out how much candy Ginger has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces} \]

And how much candy Amy has left after 14 days:
\[ 100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces} \]

Finally, we determine how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger:
\[ 58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks. The final answer is:

"To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs, we first need to calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered. The bathroom is 36 square feet, and he needs to cover two-thirds of it. So, we calculate two-thirds of 36 square feet:

\[ \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ sq ft} \]

Now, we know that for every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles. So, for 24 square feet, the number of tiles needed is:

\[ \text{Number of tiles} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft} = 576 \text{ tiles} \]

So, Mr. Boarden needs 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{576} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

James had to pay $20 to go pick the blueberries and then $1.5 for each pound he picked. He picked 30 pounds, so the cost for the blueberries is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pound} = \$45 \]

Adding the cost to go picking, the total cost for James is:
\[ \$20 + \$45 = \$65 \]

Now, let's look at the cost if he had bought the blueberries at the store. The store sells them at $2.5 per pound, and he picked 30 pounds, so the cost at the store is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.5 \text{ per pound} = \$75 \]

To find out how much James saved, we subtract the cost he paid from the cost at the store:
\[ \$75 - \$65 = \$10 \]

So, James saved:
\[ \$10 \]

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The company originally planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each. So, the total planned cost was:

\[ 500 \times 700 = 350,000 \]

But the price of each computer went up by 10%. To find the new price, we calculate 10% of $700 and add it to $700:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \]
\[ \text{New price} = 700 + 70 = 770 \]

Now, we need to find out the total cost for 500 computers at the new price of $770 each:

\[ 500 \times 770 = 385,000 \]

So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is $385,000.

"Okay, let me break it down simply:

John makes an omelet with 6 eggs, 2 ounces of cheese, and 2 ounces of ham. We need to find out how many calories are in the omelet.

First, let's calculate the calories from the eggs:
- Each egg has 75 calories.
- John uses 6 eggs.
- So, the calories from eggs = 6 × 75 = 450 calories.

Next, let's calculate the calories from the cheese:
- The cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
- John uses 2 ounces of cheese.
- So, the calories from cheese = 2 × 120 = 240 calories.

Then, let's calculate the calories from the ham:
- The ham has 40 calories per ounce.
- John uses 2 ounces of ham.
- So, the calories from ham = 2 × 40 = 80 calories.

Now, let's add up all the calories:

First, we need to find out how much 6 pencils cost. Each pencil costs $0.50, so:
\[ 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 8 erasers. Each eraser costs $0.25, so:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2.00 \]

Now, we add the cost of the pencils and the erasers together:
\[ 3.00 + 2.00 = 5.00 \]

You paid $10 for all the pencils and erasers. To find out how much change you get, we subtract the total cost from the amount you paid:
\[ 10.00 - 5.00 = 5.00 \]

So, the change you would get is $5.00."
"Okay, let me break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. First, we know that 30% of the 100 people get an interview. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[ 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]
   So, 30 people get an interview.

2. Next, 20% of these interviewees get a job offer. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
   \[ 30 \times 0.20 = 6 \]
   So, 6 people get a job offer.

3. Finally, a third of the people who get a job offer accept the position. To find out how many that is, we calculate:

   - Right foot taps at 300 taps per minute.
   - Left foot taps at 250 taps per minute.
   - Combined rate: 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.
   - Total taps in 3 minutes: 550 taps/minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

2. **Dancing with arms raised:**
   - Right foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
   - Left foot taps at 200 taps per minute.
   - Combined rate: 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.
   - Total taps in 2 minutes: 400 taps/minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

3. **Total taps:**
   - Taps with both hands at her sides: 1650 taps.
   - Taps with arms raised: 800 taps.
   - Total taps: 1650 + 800 = 2450 taps.

So, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet is 2450. The correct answer is \(\boxed{2450}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, it will cost him $450 to fix the damage to his car. But if he decides to fix it himself, he has to pay a fine of $120 and buy 3 buckets of asphalt. Each bucket costs $25.

First, let's calculate the cost of the asphalt:
- 3 buckets at $25 each is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Now, add the fine and the cost of the asphalt:
- Fine: $120
- Cost of asphalt: $75
- Total cost: $120 + $75 = $195

The damage to his car if the pothole isn't fixed is $450. So, to find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself, we subtract the total cost from the damage:
- $450 - $195 = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself. The answer is $255."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The restaurant starts with 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs.
2. They send 20 normal chairs and 13 baby chairs to the carpenter for repair.
3. To find out how many normal chairs are left, we subtract the repaired chairs from the total normal chairs: \(170 - 20 = 150\).
4. To find out how many baby chairs are left, we subtract the repaired chairs from the total baby chairs: \(23 - 13 = 10\).
5. Now, we add the remaining normal chairs and baby chairs to find the total number of chairs left: \(150 + 10 = 160\).

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left. 

The final answer is 160."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices. So, the total number of slices is:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Bryce and two of his friends ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, they ate:
\[ 3 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

The other two friends ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. So, they ate:
\[ 2 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we add the slices eaten by all four friends:
\[ 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices} \]

To find out how many slices are left, we subtract the slices eaten from the total slices:
\[ 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes. The dog eats the same amount of sausages but in \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the time it takes the cat. So, we first need to find out how long it takes the dog to eat the sausages.

\[
\text{Time for the dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, to find the average time both the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages, we add their times together and then divide by 2.

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the average time the two take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Topher's shoe is 100 inches long. The problem says this length is 10 inches more than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. So, if we let the length of Bobby's shoe be \( x \) inches, we can write the equation:

\[ 100 = 9x + 10 \]

Now, we need to solve for \( x \). First, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 100 - 10 = 9x \]
\[ 90 = 9x \]

Next, we divide both sides by 9:

\[ x = \frac{90}{9} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the length of Bobby's shoe is 10 inches. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let me break it down step by step for you.

First, we need to find out how many windows there are in the students' cars. There are 64 students' cars, and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is:
\[ 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows} \]

Next, we calculate the number of windows in the teachers' cars. There are 32 teachers' cars, and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is:
\[ 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Now, we need to find out how many windows Hannah smashes. She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

First, the number of windows smashed from the students' cars:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows} \]

Next, the number of windows smashed from the teachers' cars:
\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of windows smashed:
\[ 64 + 48 = 112 \]

So, the total number of windows Hannah smashes is 112."
"To find out what percentage of the spools are blue, we first need to add up all the spools Candy has. She has 15 light blue spools, 45 dark blue spools, 40 light green spools, and 50 dark green spools. 

So, the total number of spools is:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green) = 150 spools in total.

Next, we add up all the blue spools:
15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) = 60 blue spools.

To find the percentage of blue spools, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100 \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 \]

Simplifying the fraction:
\[ \frac{60}{150} = 0.4 \]

Then, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:
\[ 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \]

So, 40% of the spools are blue. The correct answer is 40%."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote. By midday, which is 12:00, 2/5 of these people had voted. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000 \]

This means 2000 people had voted by midday. So, the number of people left to vote is:

\[ 5000 - 2000 = 3000 \]

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people voted. So, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000 \]

This means 2000 more people voted by 16:00. So, the number of people who did not vote by 16:00 is:

\[ 3000 - 2000 = 1000 \]

So, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000. The final answer is 1000."
"To figure out how many packs of gum Parker will need for 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of pieces of gum he will chew. Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day, so in 30 days, he will chew:

\[ 4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ pieces} \]

Each pack of gum contains 15 pieces. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ pieces}}{15 \text{ pieces/pack}} = 8 \text{ packs} \]

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many smores are needed in total. There are 9 kids and each wants 2 smores, so:
\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} = 18 \text{ smores} \]

There are also 6 adults, and each wants 1 smore, so:
\[ 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 6 \text{ smores} \]

Adding these together gives:
\[ 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Next, we need to figure out how many graham cracker bases are needed. Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 smores, so:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, we need:
\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

So, they will need 1 box of graham crackers. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Dora is 15 years old. According to the problem, Dora's father is eight more than twice Dora's age. So, we calculate Dora's father's age as follows:

\[
\text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8 = 2 \times 15 + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38
\]

Next, we know Dora's mother is four years younger than her father. So, we calculate Dora's mother's age as:

\[
\text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4 = 38 - 4 = 34
\]

Now, to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we add their ages together:

\[
\text{Total combined age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age} = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87
\]

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87. 

The correct answer is \boxed{87}."
"To figure out how much money each person gets, we need to split the $20 equally among Greg and his 3 siblings. That makes a total of 4 people.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Cindy has two math and science books, each weighing 2 pounds. So, the total weight for these books is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/book} \times 2 \text{ books} = 4 \text{ pounds} \]

She also has a French book that weighs 4 pounds and an English book that weighs 3 pounds. So, the total weight for these two books is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 3 \text{ pounds} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Lastly, her history book weighs twice as much as her English book. Since the English book weighs 3 pounds, the history book weighs:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ pounds} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add up the weights of all the books:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} + 7 \text{ pounds} + 6 \text{ pounds} = 17 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of all the books Cindy is carrying is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there were 100 voters in total. Candidate A got 20% of the votes. To find out how many votes that is, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate A got 20 votes. Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A. To find out how many more votes that is, we calculate:

\[ 50\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate B got 10 more votes than candidate A, which means:

\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes} \]

Now, to find out how many votes candidate C got, we subtract the votes of candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes} \]

So, candidate C got 50 votes. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Boris starts with 100 apples. Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has:
\[ 100 - 23 = 77 \text{ apples} \]

Now, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Boris will have:
\[ 100 - 10 = 90 \text{ apples} \]
And Beck will have:
\[ 77 + 10 = 87 \text{ apples} \]

To find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now, we subtract the number of apples Beck has from the number of apples Boris has:
\[ 90 - 87 = 3 \]

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much water Peter has left.

First, we need to calculate how much water Peter uses for each type of cube:

1. For the giant cubes:
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - So, the total water used for giant cubes is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) ounces.

2. For the medium cubes:
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - So, the total water used for medium cubes is \(7 \times 2 = 14\) ounces.

3. For the small cubes:
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - So, the total water used for small cubes is \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

Now, we add up the water used for all the cubes:
- Total water used = water for giant cubes + water for medium cubes + water for small cubes
- Total water used = 12 ounces + 14 ounces + 4 ounces = 30 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. So, the water left is:
- Water left = initial water - total water used
- Water left = 32 ounces - 30 ounces = 2 ounces.

So, Peter has \(\boxed{2}\) ounces of water left."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We know Clara has 20 books. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, we can find out how many books Steven has by dividing Clara's books by 2:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so we add 6 to Steven's books to find out how many books Alice has:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

Now, to find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Difference} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

So, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Cecelia found out that a gallon jar costs $5. We also know that a half-gallon jar costs $2 less than a gallon jar. So, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar like this:

\[
\text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a gallon jar} - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3
\]

Now, we need to find out how much Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

1. **Cost of 10-gallon jars:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 10-gallon jars} = 10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

2. **Cost of 16 half-gallon jars:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 16 half-gallon jars} = 16 \times 3 = 48
   \]

To find the total amount Cecelia spent, we add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 50 + 48 = 98
\]

So, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is $98."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We know there are 50 students in total. Out of these, 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, the number of students who like either video games or music is \(50 - 10 - 5 = 35\).

The problem also tells us that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball. Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Now, we know that the total number of students who like video games or music is 35. If 10 students like to play music, then the rest must like to play video games. So, the number of students who like to play video games is \(35 - 10 = 25\).

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Initially, Jeremy saw 12 birds in the backyard. When he threw a stone, he scared away 1/3 of those 12 birds. To find out how many birds he scared away, we divide 12 by 3, which gives us 4 birds. So, the number of birds left after he scared some away is 12 minus 4, which is 8 birds.

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the backyard. So, we add those 20 birds to the 8 birds that were left. That means we add 8 and 20, which gives us 28 birds.

So, the total number of birds in the backyard now is 28."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We know there are 80 students in total, and they are divided into two classes with the same number of students in each class. So, each class has:

\[ \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ students} \]

In each class, 40% of the students are girls. To find out how many girls are in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:

\[ 0.40 \times 40 = 16 \text{ girls} \]

Since each class has 40 students and 16 of them are girls, the rest must be boys. So, the number of boys in each class is:

\[ 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ boys} \]

Therefore, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"Let's go through the problem step by step:

Mark buys 3 packs of magic cards for $1800 each. So, the total cost is:
\[ 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \text{ dollars} \]

He gets 1 card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. So, the total value of these cards is:
\[ 4000 + 1000 + (30 \times 50) = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much profit Mark made, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:
\[ 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Mark made is:
\[ \boxed{1100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the first amusement park:

- The cost for each adult is $26.
- The cost for each child is $12.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children in the family.

First, we calculate the total cost for the adults:
\[ 2 \times 26 = 52 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the children:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]

Now, we add these two amounts to get the total cost for the first amusement park:
\[ 52 + 24 = 76 \]

Now, let's do the same for the second amusement park:

- The cost for each adult is $14.
- The cost for each child is $10.
- There are 2 adults and 2 children in the family.

First, we calculate the total cost for the adults:
\[ 2 \times 14 = 28 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the children:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, we add these two amounts to get the total cost for the second amusement park:
\[ 28 + 20 = 48 \]

To find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the total cost of the second park from the total cost of the first park:
\[ 76 - 48 = 28 \]

So, they can save $28 by choosing the second amusement park. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{28}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each and he buys 500 tomatoes a day. So, the cost per day was:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day} \]

Now, he switched to a new vendor who sells tomatoes for $0.4 each. So, the cost per day with the new vendor is:
\[ 500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day} \]

The difference in cost per day is:
\[ \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, the weekly savings are:
\[ \$50/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$350/\text{week} \]

So, the vendor saves \(\boxed{350}\) dollars a week."
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

We know Sean has 56 marbles. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, so:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, so:

\[ \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Now, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have together, we add their marbles:

\[ \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

So, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined. The final answer is:

\[ 336 \]"
"To solve this, let's think about it step by step. We have 54 students and we need to divide them into groups. The question asks how many more groups are needed if we want to have 12 groups instead of 6.

First, let's see how many students would be in each group if we split them into 6 groups:
\[ \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group} \]

This means we can form 6 groups of 9 students each. Now, the question asks how many more groups we need to form 12 groups. Since we already have 6 groups, we need:
\[ 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ more groups} \]

So, the number of additional groups needed is 6. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To find out how many chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many chairs Candy rents out in one 4-week month. There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week. So, in 4 weeks, there are:
- 5 weekdays/day * 4 days/week = 20 weekdays
- 2 weekend days/day * 4 days/week = 8 weekend days

Now, let's calculate the chairs rented out:
- Chairs rented on weekdays: 60 chairs/day * 20 days = 1200 chairs
- Chairs rented on weekends: 100 chairs/day * 8 days = 800 chairs

So, in one 4-week month, Candy rents out:
- 1200 chairs + 800 chairs = 2000 chairs

Since we are looking at two 4-week months, we multiply the number of chairs rented in one month by 2:
- 2000 chairs * 2 = 4000 chairs

Therefore, the total number of chairs Candy can rent out in two 4-week months is 4000 chairs. The correct answer is 4000."

First, we divide the $100 bill by the 4 roommates to find out how much each person pays each month:
\[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]
So, each roommate pays $25 per month.

Next, we need to find out how much each roommate pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply $25 by 12:
\[ 25 \times 12 = 300 \]

So, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 times 12, so that's 96 glasses.
- 4 dozen plates, which is 4 times 12, so that's 48 plates.

When they were returned, 10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were broken. So, we need to subtract these broken items from the total sent.

For the glasses:
- Total sent: 96
- Broken: 10
- Remaining: 96 - 10 = 86 glasses

For the plates:
- Total sent: 48
- Broken: 6
- Remaining: 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Now, to find out how many items Jeff has now, we add the remaining glasses and plates together:
- Remaining glasses: 86
- Remaining plates: 42
- Total remaining: 86 + 42 = 128

So, Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now. The final answer is 128."
"Let's go through the problem step by step to find out how many buttons Lorraine ends up with.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - She trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 \)

So, by the end, Lorraine has 107 buttons. The final answer is 107."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
He played 1 match on Friday.
On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, he played \(2 \times 2 = 4\) matches on Saturday.

Now, we add up all the matches:
- Monday: 2 matches
- Friday: 1 match
- Saturday: 4 matches

So, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(2 + 1 + 4 = 7\).

Therefore, the total number of matches Joey played in one week is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the total number of people on the council is 33. The problem tells us that the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against. So, if we let the number of votes against be \( x \), then the number of votes in favor would be \( 2x \).

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which is \( x + 2x = 3x \). We know this total is 33, so we can set up the equation:

\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, there are 11 votes against the new regulation. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, we multiply 11 by 2:

\[ 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{22}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Krissa needs to order shirts for her preschool students. Here's how we can figure out how many shirts she needs:

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - 11 students need XS shirts.

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - So, 22 students need S shirts.

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - So, 18 students need M shirts.

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - So, 9 students need L shirts.

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - So, 15 students need XL shirts.

Now, let's add up all the students needing each size of shirt:

\[
\text{Total shirts} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
\]

\[
\text{Total shirts} = 75
\]

So, Krissa needs to order **75** shirts in total."
"To find out how much you will pay after a 5% discount on a $140 item, you first need to calculate the discount amount. A 5% discount means you save 5 cents for every dollar. So, for $140, you save:

\[ 140 \times 0.05 = 7 \]

This means you save $7. So, you will pay:

\[ 140 - 7 = 133 \]

So, the final amount you will pay after the discount is $133."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know John has 20 playlists, and each playlist has 300 songs. So, the total number of songs across all playlists is:
\[ 300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs} \]

Each song is 10 hours long, so the total number of hours for all the songs combined is:
\[ 6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60000 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last is:
\[ \boxed{60000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
\[ 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ people} \]

2. After those 10 people, we have:
\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people} \]

3. Now, 60% of these 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
\[ 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ people} \]

4. The rest of the people think horse #12 will win. So, we subtract the number of people who think horse #7 will win from the 40 people left:
\[ 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is 16."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. Let's call the total number of puppies \( P \). So, the number of Pomeranian puppies is \( \frac{2}{3}P \).

We also know that one third of these Pomeranian puppies are girls, and there are 6 Pomeranian girls. So, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2}{3}P \right) = 6 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ \frac{2}{9}P = 6 \]

To find \( P \), we need to solve for \( P \) by isolating it on one side. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{9}{2} \):
\[ P = 6 \times \frac{9}{2} = 27 \]

So, Jana has a total of 27 puppies. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"
"Jayden originally had $70 from selling pictures. His sister gave him half of her $90 allowance, which is $45. So, Jayden now has $70 + $45 = $115. The camera costs $200, so to find out how much more Jayden needs, we subtract the money he has from the cost of the camera: $200 - $115 = $85. Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera. The correct answer is:

\[

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Let's say the second house needs \( x \) cases of shingles. Then the first house needs half of that, which is \( \frac{1}{2}x \), and the third house needs double what the first house needs, so that's \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \).

So, the total number of cases is:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double what the first house needs, which is also 100 cases.

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"

George has 200 bananas. He has 45% more pears than bananas. To find out how many pears he has, we first calculate 45% of 200 bananas:

\[ 45\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.45 \times 200 = 90 \]

So, George has 90 more pears than 200 bananas. That means he has:

\[ 200 + 90 = 290 \text{ pears} \]

Now, to find out the total number of fruits, we add the number of bananas and pears together:

\[ 200 \text{ bananas} + 290 \text{ pears} = 490 \text{ fruits} \]

So, the total number of fruits George has is 490."

"To find out how much money Sam would need to spend to make 4 liters of juice, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice:**
   - We know that 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges.
   - So, for 4 liters of juice, the amount of oranges needed is:
     \[
     4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kilograms/liter} = 20 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges:**
   - Each kilogram of oranges costs $3.
   - Therefore, the cost for 20 kilograms of oranges is:
     \[
     20 \text{ kilograms} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

So, Sam would have to spend **60 dollars** to make 4 liters of juice.

The correct answer is **60 dollars**."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

We know that in one hour, Ezra read 300 books. The problem also tells us that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed. So, if we let the number of books Ahmed read be \( A \), then we can say:

\[ 2A = 300 \]

To find out how many books Ahmed read, we divide 300 by 2:

\[ A = \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

So, Ahmed read 150 books.

Now, we need to find out how many books they read altogether. We add the number of books Ezra read to the number of books Ahmed read:

\[ 300 + 150 = 450 \]

So, the total number of books they read together is 450.

The final answer is \(\boxed{450}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for Monday and Wednesday to find out how much Tanya earned.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each day.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She teaches more than 3 classes, so she gets an extra $5.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Since she teaches more than 3 classes, she gets an extra $5:
\[ \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each day.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not teach more than 3 classes, so she doesn't get the extra $5.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

So, her total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \$60 \]

The company sold 5 vanilla scents each time and they did this 5 times. So, the total number of vanilla scents sold is:
\[ 5 \text{ vanilla scents/sale} \times 5 \text{ sales} = 25 \text{ vanilla scents} \]

They also sold 2 fruity scents each time and they did this 2 times. So, the total number of fruity scents sold is:
\[ 2 \text{ fruity scents/sale} \times 2 \text{ sales} = 4 \text{ fruity scents} \]

Now, to find out how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents, we subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
\[ 25 \text{ vanilla scents} - 4 \text{ fruity scents} = 21 \text{ more vanilla scents} \]

So, the number of vanilla scents sold is 21 more than the number of fruity scents sold. The final answer is:

"To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we need to add the time he spends driving to the museum and the time he spends at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the return trip is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back home is also 2 hours. So, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Henry needs 4 wheels for each car and he has 57 cars. So, for the cars, he needs:
\[ 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

For the motorcycles, he needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle and he has 73 motorcycles. So, for the motorcycles, he needs:
\[ 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Now, let's add the wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Henry has 650 wheels in total. To find out how many wheels are left after assembling all the toys, we subtract the total wheels needed from the total wheels he has:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

So, the number of wheels left is 276. 

The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mike has 600 movies in total. A third of these are in series, so:
\[ \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ movies in series} \]

This means the rest of the movies are not in series:
\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies not in series} \]

Out of these 400 movies, 40% are older movies:
\[ 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ older movies} \]

So, the number of non-older movies that are not in series is:
\[ 400 - 160 = 240 \text{ non-older movies} \]

Now, let's calculate the cost for each type of movie:
- The cost for the series movies is $6 each:
\[ 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]

- The cost for the non-older movies is $10 each:
\[ 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]

- The cost for the older movies is $5 each:
\[ 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[ 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400 \]

So, the total cost to replace the movies is:

"To find out how far the vacation spot is, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the distance driven:
- They drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- Distance driven = Speed × Time = 50 miles/hour × 6 hours = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked:
- They hiked for 1.5 hours.
- The average speed when hiking is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half of the driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
- Therefore, the hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
- Distance hiked = Speed × Time = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Now, we add the distance driven and the distance hiked to find the total distance to the vacation spot:
- Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

So, the vacation spot is 330 miles away. The correct answer is 330 miles."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out the difference in their scores.

Ava and Emma play a level in a video game where they get points for enemies, berries, and time left. Here are the points they get:
- 10 points for every enemy they jump on.
- 5 points for each berry they collect.
- 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level.

Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma and collects 3 more berries than Emma. Also, Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

First, let's calculate the points Ava gets:
- Ava jumps on \( E_A = E_E + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects \( B_A = B_E + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, so she gets \( 30 \times (-4) = -120 \) points from the time left.

Now, let's calculate the points Emma gets:
- Emma jumps on \( E_E \) enemies.
- Emma collects \( B_E \) berries.
- Emma finishes the level in the same time as Ava, so she gets \( 30 \times 0 = 0 \) points from the time left.

Now, let's calculate the total points for each:
- Ava's points from enemies: \( 10 \times 8 = 80 \)
- Ava's points from berries: \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \)
- Ava's points from time left: \( -120 \)

So, Ava's total score is:
\[ 80 + 15 - 120 = -25 \]

For Emma:
- Emma's points from enemies: \( 10 \times 0 = 0 \)
- Emma's points from berries: \( 5 \times 0 = 0 \)
- Emma's points from time left: \( 30 \times 0 = 0 \)

So, Emma's total score is:
\[ 0 + 0 + 0 = -215 \]

Now, let's find the difference between their scores:
\[ -25 - (-215) = -25 + 215 = 190 \]

So, the difference between their scores is 190. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{190} \]"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day on 5 days. So, for those 5 days, they ride:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

On the other 2 days, they ride twice as much as usual. So, they ride:
\[ 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \]
For those 2 days, they ride:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, let's add the rides from both sets of days:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

So, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is 27. The correct answer is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

Bob originally had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.

He went to the pet store and got 17 more fish. After adding these to his pond, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish.

First, let's say he got \( w \) white fish and \( o \) orange fish from the pet store. So, \( w + o = 17 \).

After adding these fish, the total number of orange fish became \( 3 + o \) and the total number of white fish became \( 4 + w \).

According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

1. From the first equation:
\[ w + o = 17 \]

2. From the second equation:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Now, substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ w + (2w + 5) = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

So, Bob bought 4 white fish. To find out how many orange fish he bought, we use \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

Now, let's check if this solution works:
- Total fish bought: \( 4 + 13 = 17 \)
- After adding, orange fish: \( 3 + 13 = 16 \)
- After adding, white fish: \( 4 + 4 = 8 \)
- Check if orange fish is twice the white fish: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \)

The solution checks out. Therefore, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Andy drives to work and back home each day from Monday to Friday. That's 5 days a week. Each way to work is 5 miles, so a round trip is 10 miles. Over 5 days, he drives:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

His car gets 10 miles per gallon, so the number of gallons he uses in a week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

The price of gas is $3 per gallon, so the cost for 5 gallons is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 worth of gas per week. 

The final answer is: **15**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Carrie has ten twenties, and each twenty is worth $20. So, the total amount in twenties is:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

She also has 140 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so the total amount in quarters is:
\[ 140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, she spent all the quarters, which is $35. She also spent 3/5 of the twenties. The amount spent on the twenties is:
\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{3 \times 200}{5} = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount she spent is:
\[ 35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Ricardo has tomato plants and eggplant plants. Each tomato plant gives him 22 tomatoes, and each eggplant plant gives him 4 eggplants. He has 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants.

First, let's find out how many tomatoes he gets:
- Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes.
- He has 5 tomato plants.
- So, the total number of tomatoes is \(5 \times 22 = 110\).

Next, let's find out how many eggplants he gets:
- Each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants.
- He has 8 eggplant plants.
- So, the total number of eggplants is \(8 \times 4 = 32\).

Now, to find the total number of fruits, we add the tomatoes and the eggplants together:
- Total fruits = Total tomatoes + Total eggplants
- Total fruits = 110 + 32 = 142.

So, the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants is 142. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{142}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Samwell sold a total of 40 TVs. One-fourth of these are smart TVs, and one-eighth are analog TVs. We need to find out how many are OLED TVs.

First, let's calculate the number of smart TVs:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of analog TVs:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, to find out how many are OLED TVs, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

So, the number of OLED TVs sold is 25."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

The total cost of the trip is $300. The school is covering half of this cost, so the school will contribute:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

John currently has $50. After the school's contribution, the remaining amount John needs is:
\[ 300 - 150 = 150 \]

Since John already has $50, the additional amount he needs is:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \]

So, John is missing $100. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the temperature during the night is 33 degrees colder than during the day. If the temperature during the day is 45 degrees, then the temperature during the night is:
\[ 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees} \]

The pipes will freeze if the temperature is below 32 degrees. So, we need to raise the temperature from 12 degrees to 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing. The difference in temperature we need to raise is:
\[ 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees} \]

Each log of wood raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees, we divide 20 by 5:
\[ \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs} \]

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 90 people and they are split into groups of 9 people each. To find out how many groups there are, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

\[ \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. The problem says that \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the groups brought back seashells. So, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of groups bringing back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \]

Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells. So, to find the total number of seashells, we multiply the number of groups bringing back seashells by 2:

\[ \text{Total number of seashells} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

So, the total number of seashells brought back is 12. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Okay, let me walk you through this step by step.

Initially, the train has 172 people on it.

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172:
\[ 172 - 47 = 125 \]

Then, 13 more people get on, so we add 13 to 125:
\[ 125 + 13 = 138 \]

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138:
\[ 138 - 38 = 100 \]

So, the number of people on the train after the second stop is 100.

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day. If he does this for 30 days, we can calculate the total number of bottle caps he gets by multiplying 10 by 30:
\[ 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ bottle caps} \]

Each bottle cap is worth $0.25. So, to find out how much money he gets, we multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:
\[ 300 \times 0.25 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for Jamie's pay calculation.

Jamie earns $20 per hour for her regular 8 hours of work each day. For the additional hours, she gets paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. So, her special hourly rate is:
\[ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Last Tuesday, Jamie worked a total of 11 hours. Out of these, 8 hours are regular hours and the remaining 3 hours are additional hours.

First, we calculate her earnings for the regular hours:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate her earnings for the additional hours:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add these two amounts to find her total pay for the day:
\[ 160 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jamie was paid \(\boxed{250}\) dollars for her work on last Tuesday."
"To find out how many lions are in the enclosure, we start by noting the number of female lions, which is 12. The number of male lions is half the number of female lions, so we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]

Next, we know there are 14 lion cubs. To find the total number of lions, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together:

\[ \text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 \]

So, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"Mike needed a new pair of jeans that originally cost $40.00, and they were on sale for 25% off. To find out how much he saved, we calculate 25% of $40.00:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00 \]

So, the jeans cost him $10.00 less than the original price. Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:

\[ 40.00 - 10.00 = 30.00 \]

Mike paid with a $50.00 bill. To find out how much money he has left, we subtract the sale price of the jeans from the $50.00:

\[ 50.00 - 30.00 = 20.00 \]

So, Mike will have $20.00 left over. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{20.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Initially, the company has 200 employees. Every month, they hire 20 new employees. So after three months, the number of new employees hired is:
\[ 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \]

So, the total number of employees after three months is:
\[ 200 \text{ initial employees} + 60 \text{ new employees} = 260 \text{ employees} \]

Each employee is paid $4000 per month. So, the total salary paid to all employees each month is:
\[ 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Now, to find out the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly salary by the number of months:
\[ 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $3120000.

The final answer is:

"To find out how long they will be caroling, we need to add up the time for singing ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells.""

First, let's calculate the time for ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, and each time it's 150 seconds long.
- So, the total time for ""Deck the Halls"" is \(2 \times 150 = 300\) seconds.

Next, let's calculate the time for ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once, and it's 240 seconds long.
- So, the total time for ""Jingle Bells"" is 240 seconds.

Now, we add the time for both songs:
- Total caroling time = Time for ""Deck the Halls"" + Time for ""Jingle Bells""
- Total caroling time = 300 seconds + 240 seconds = 540 seconds.

So, the total time they will be caroling is 540 seconds. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{540}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally.

First, we need to figure out Billy's hourly wage at different points in time:
- When Billy was first hired, he was paid $10 per hour.
- After 2 months, he got a raise to $10.50 per hour.
- On his first anniversary, he got another raise to $11.50 per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much Billy earns in 20 hours at each of these rates:
- For the first 2 months (20 hours each month), he earns $10 per hour:
  \[
  10 \text{ hours/month} \times 2 \text{ months} \times 20 \text{ hours/month} = 400 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- After the raise, he earns $10.50 per hour for the next 20 hours:
  \[
  10.50 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 210 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- So, in total, Billy earns:
  \[
  400 \text{ dollars} + 210 \text{ dollars} = 610 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, let's look at Sally's situation:
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's initial salary, so it's $10.50 per hour.
- Sally also works 20 hours, so her total earnings are:
  \[
  10.50 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 210 \text{ dollars}
  \]

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally, we subtract Sally's total earnings from Billy's total earnings:
\[
610 \text{ dollars} - 210 \text{ dollars} = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Billy earns $400 more than Sally in 20 hours. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{400}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

First, we need to find out how much 3 loaves of bread cost. Since each loaf costs $2, we multiply:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]
So, 3 loaves of bread cost $6.

Next, we need to find out how much 2 bagels cost. Since each bagel costs $1, we multiply:
\[ 2 \times 1 = 2 \]
So, 2 bagels cost $2.

Now, to find out how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we subtract the cost of the bagels from the cost of the bread:
\[ 6 - 2 = 4 \]

So, 3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels. The final answer is:
4"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Pierson scored 278 points. To find out how many points Nikita scored, we need to do a few calculations.

First, we find half of Pierson's score:
\[ \text{Half of Pierson's score} = \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Next, we add 11 to that to get Nikita's score:
\[ \text{Nikita's score} = 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, to find the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:
\[ \text{Total points} = 278 + 150 = 428 \]

So, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students and teachers there are in total.

The school has 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

Next, there are also 40 classes, and each class has an average of 3 teachers:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Now, we calculate the trees planted by the students and teachers.

Each student plants 1 tree, so:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding these together gives us the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

So, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1240."
"Bubbles already has 14 stuffed animals. She wants the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals after buying some. Let's figure out how many stuffed goats she needs.

If \( x \) is the number of stuffed goats she buys, the total number of stuffed animals will be \( 14 + x \). We want the stuffed goats to be 30% of this total, so:

\[ x = 0.30 \times (14 + x) \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

\[ x = 0.30 \times 14 + 0.30x \]
\[ x = 4.2 + 0.30x \]

Subtract \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

\[ x - 0.30x = 4.2 \]
\[ 0.70x = 4.2 \]

Now, divide both sides by 0.70:

\[ x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} \]
\[ x = 6 \]

So, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats to make the percentage of goats 30% of all her stuffed animals. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks have \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days. So, in 2 weeks, she plays:
\[ 14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours} \]

Next, Kris plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, in the last week she plays:
\[ 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's add the hours played in the first 2 weeks and the last week:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. So, the number of hours she still needs to play is:
\[ 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To find out how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time.

First, let's calculate the distance the first car travels:
- The first car travels at 60 miles per hour.
- It travels for 2 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance the second car travels:
- The second car travels at 70 miles per hour.
- It also travels for 2 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles.

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:
- Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles.
- Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles.
- Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

So, after 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car. The answer is 20 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out the total cost of the ring before the premium. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. So, we add these two amounts together:

\[ 600 + 300 = 900 \]

This means the total cost of the ring before the premium is $900.

Next, we need to calculate the premium. The premium is 30% of the total cost before the premium. To find 30% of $900, we multiply $900 by 0.30:

\[ 900 \times 0.30 = 270 \]

So, the premium is $270.

Now, we add the premium to the total cost before the premium to find the final amount James paid:

\[ 900 + 270 = 1170 \]

Therefore, the final amount James paid is $1170.

The correct answer is: **$1170**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students passed in each grade:

- For the third graders, 340 out of 500 passed. So, the pass rate is:
  \[
  \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \text{ or } 68\%
  \]

- For the fourth graders, 40 out of 100 passed. So, the pass rate is:
  \[
  \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \text{ or } 40\%
  \]

- For the fifth graders, the pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, so:
  \[
  2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \text{ or } 80\%
  \]

Now, let's find out how many students passed in each grade:

- Third graders: \(340\) students passed.
- Fourth graders: \(40\) students passed.
- Fifth graders: \(0.80 \times 400 = 320\) students passed.

Next, we add up the total number of students who passed:

\[
340 + 40 + 320 = 700
\]

Then, we add up the total number of students tested:

\[
500 + 100 + 400 = 1000
\]

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[
\frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \text{ or } 70\%
\]

So, the school's overall pass rate is \(70\%\).

The correct answer is \(\boxed{70\%}\)."
"Milo needs 12 glass chips to make one square inch of his mosaic. He has two bags of chips, and each bag contains 72 chips, so he has a total of 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch, he can make:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. To find out how long the mosaic can be, we use the area of the mosaic, which is 12 square inches. If the height is 3 inches, then the length \( L \) can be found by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} \]
\[ 12 \text{ square inches} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]
\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

So, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 4 students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Next, 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

We are told that there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students drank. So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party was 12 gallons. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies. He sold 150 candies, but he only had 100 candies to begin with, so he needed to order more. After selling 100 candies, he ordered 100 more candies. Now he has a total of 200 candies (100 he had plus 100 he ordered).

He has already sold 150 candies, so he needs to sell 50 more candies to have all 200 sold.

So, the number of candies Dale still needs to sell is 50.

The answer is: **50**"
"To solve this, let's break it down month by month:

- At the beginning of the year, there are 10 students.
- By the end of January, the number of students doubles, so we have \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students.
- By the end of February, the number doubles again, so we have \(20 \times 2 = 40\) students.
- By the end of March, the number doubles again, so we have \(40 \times 2 = 80\) students.
- By the end of April, the number doubles again, so we have \(80 \times 2 = 160\) students.
- By the end of May, the number doubles again, so we have \(160 \times 2 = 320\) students.

Now, to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May, we subtract the number of students at the beginning of the year from the number at the end of May:
\[ 320 - 10 = 310 \]

So, the number of additional students who joined by the end of May is 310. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to figure out the total number of branches he climbed during the week. He made $105, and each branch costs $0.25. So, we divide the total money he made by the cost per branch:

\[ \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420 \]

Felix made this money in a week, which has 7 days. To find out how many branches he climbed on average each day, we divide the total branches by the number of days:

\[ \text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60 \]

So, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each. So, she picks:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Next, she picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each. So, she picks:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ petals} \]

Then, she picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each. So, she picks:
\[ 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ petals} \]

Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each. So, she picks:
\[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ petals} \]

Now, let's add all these petals together:
\[ 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals} \]

But then, she drops 1 flower of each type. So, she drops:
\[ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals} \]

Now, we subtract the dropped petals from the total:
\[ 101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals} \]

So, the total number of petals in the vase is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we start with 35 marshmallows. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so together they make:
\[ 9 + 9 = 18 \]
S'mores. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the total number of marshmallows used and dropped is:
\[ 18 + 3 = 21 \]
marshmallows.

Now, we subtract the used and dropped marshmallows from the original number:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]
So, they have 14 marshmallows left.

Since they have 14 marshmallows left and they want to split them equally, each of them can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]
S'mores.

So, the number of S'mores each kid can have is 7. The answer is:

Jack can play for 20 minutes with one quarter. His two friends who are worse can each play for half that time, which is 10 minutes. The better friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, so he can play for 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time they can play:
- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- Each of the two worse friends plays for 10 minutes, so together they play for 10 + 10 = 20 minutes.
- The better friend plays for 30 minutes.

So, the total time they can play together is 20 + 20 + 30 = 70 minutes.

They play for 4 hours, which is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. To find out how many quarters they need, we divide the total playtime by the time one quarter allows:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters} \]

So, the total amount of money used is 12 quarters. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, the same amount of salt as sugar, twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest. We also know the total mixture is 10 ounces.

Let's say the amount of salt (and sugar) is \( S \). Then:
- The amount of oil is \( 2S \) (twice as much as salt).
- The amount of fragrance is \( S \) (same as salt).
- The amount of citrus zest is \( S \) (same as salt).
- The amount of sugar is \( S \) (same as salt).

So, the total mixture is:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, the amount of oil is \( 2S \):
\[ 2S = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

So, the amount of oil used is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces.

If we need to choose from multiple-choice options, let's assume the options are:
A) 2 ounces
B) 3 ounces
C) 4 ounces
D) 5 ounces
E) 6 ounces
F) 7 ounces
G) 8 ounces
H) 9 ounces
I) 10 ounces
J) 12 ounces

The correct answer would be \( \frac{10}{3} \), which is approximately 3.33 ounces. So, the closest option would be B) 3 ounces.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]"
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

John buys 3 goats, and each goat costs $500. So, the total cost for the goats is:
\[ 3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, John buys 2 cows, and each cow costs $1500. So, the total cost for the cows is:
\[ 2 \times 1500 = 3000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much money John spent in total, we add the cost of the goats and the cows together:
\[ 1500 + 3000 = 4500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John spent a total of $4500. The final answer is:
\[ 4500 \]"
"Paul already has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes, so he has a total of 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes. He needs 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more he needs to buy, we subtract the cupcakes he already has from the total he needs:

63 - 48 = 15

So, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes. The correct answer is 15."
"Okay, let's go through the problem again step by step.

Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. If Robert has 20 cars, then Joe has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. So, he sells \(0.20 \times 40 = 8\) cars.

After selling 8 cars, Joe has \(40 - 8 = 32\) cars left.

Joe then gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold. So, he gives away \(2 \times 8 = 16\) cars.

After giving away 16 cars, Joe has \(32 - 16 = 16\) cars left.

So, the number of cars Joe remains with is 16.

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

The total money raised by the charity is $175,000. Out of this, $50,000 comes from organizations. So, the students raised the rest, which is $125,000.

There are 20 students working together, and they all earned the same amount. To find out how much each student raised, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students.

So, we do $125,000 ÷ 20 = $6,250.

Each student raised $6,250. 

If the question was in a multiple-choice format, the correct answer would be:

A) $6,250

This is the final answer."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which means she walked for \(8 / 2 = 4\) hours.

To find the total time she walked over the two days, we add the hours from both days:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Since we need the total time in minutes, we convert hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{720}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

1. Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot.
2. During the first break, he saw 20 more cars, so the total number of cars became 50 + 20 = 70 cars.
3. When he got out of class for lunch, half of these 70 cars had left. So, we need to find half of 70, which is 70 / 2 = 35 cars.

So, the number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35. 

The correct answer is: **35**"
"To figure out how much John makes in a week, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know John does 30 cycles of work each day. Each cycle has 5 tasks, and each task pays $1.20. So, to find out how much he makes in one day, we multiply the number of cycles by the number of tasks per cycle and then by the pay per task:

\[ 30 \text{ cycles/day} \times 5 \text{ tasks/cycle} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$180/\text{day} \]

Now, since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by 7 to find out his weekly earnings:

\[ \$180/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$1260 \]

So, John makes $1260 in a full 7-day week. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{1260}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

In the first game:
- Sasha scored 14 points.
- Julie scored 4 points less than Sasha, so Julie scored \(14 - 4 = 10\) points.

In the second game:
- Julie scored 10 points in the first game.
- Sasha scored 6 points less than Julie in the second game, so Sasha scored \(10 - 6 = 4\) points.

Now, to find the total points Sasha scored during both games:
- Sasha's points in the first game: 14 points.
- Sasha's points in the second game: 4 points.
- Total points for Sasha: \(14 + 4 = 18\) points.

So, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18. The correct answer is 18."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought. She bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. So, we multiply 8 by 11:

\[ 8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins of cat food} \]

Next, we calculate the number of tins of dog food. Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. So, we multiply 6 by 6:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins of dog food} \]

Now, to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the number of tins of dog food from the number of tins of cat food:

\[ 88 - 36 = 52 \text{ tins} \]

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{52} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total number of cards is 341. Let's say PJ has \( P \) cards. Then Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards because he has 3 times as many as PJ. Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards because she has 12 more than Smendrick.

So, the total number of cards can be written as:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Now, divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

So, PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has \( 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards. Becca has \( 3 \times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

Therefore, the number of cards Becca has is 153."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

Cindy has 5 green eggs. She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) blue eggs. She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so that's \(10 - 1 = 9\) pink eggs. And she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so that's \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\) yellow eggs.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

So, the total number of eggs is \(5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27\).

Therefore, the total number of eggs Cindy has is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Milly will lose.

First, we need to calculate the shipping cost. The book weighs 4 pounds and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound. So, for the weight of the book, the cost is:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.35 \text{ per pound} = \$1.40 \]

Next, the shipping company also charges $0.08 per mile for the distance. The book needs to be returned 20 miles away, so the cost for the distance is:
\[ 20 \text{ miles} \times \$0.08 \text{ per mile} = \$1.60 \]

Now, we add the cost for the weight and the cost for the distance to get the total shipping cost:
\[ \$1.40 + \$1.60 = \$3.00 \]

The book Milly bought cost $32. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the purchase price, the refundable amount is:
\[ 75\% \text{ of } \$32 = 0.75 \times \$32 = \$24 \]

To find out how much Milly will lose, we subtract the refundable amount from the total cost:
\[ \$32 + \$3.00 - \$24 = \$11.00 \]

So, Milly will lose \(\boxed{11}\) dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Mulan starts with $40. Her father gives her $100, so she now has:
\[ 40 + 100 = 140 \]

She then buys two pairs of jeans, each costing $30, so the total cost for the jeans is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

She also buys a bag for $20. So, the total cost of the items she bought is:
\[ 60 + 20 = 80 \]

Now, to find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from the money she had initially:
\[ 140 - 80 = 60 \]

So, Mulan has $60 left. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week. In the second week, he produces half of that, which is:
\[ 8,000 \div 2 = 4,000 \text{ bars} \]

In the third week, he produces three times the amount of the first week, which is:
\[ 8,000 \times 3 = 24,000 \text{ bars} \]

Now, let's add up the production for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Since Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{14000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month.

First, we calculate the time she spends on TikTok videos each week:
- Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
- So, the time spent on TikTok videos per week is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes.

Next, we add the time she spends writing songs:
- She spends 2 hours a week writing songs. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2 hours is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.

Then, we add the time she spends on makeup:
- She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. So, the time spent on makeup per week is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.

Now, we add up all these times to find out how much time she spends on TikTok-related activities each week:
- Total time per week = Time on videos + Time on songs + Time on makeup
- Total time per week = \(72 + 120 + 90 = 282\) minutes.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly total by 4 to find the monthly total:
- Total time per month = \(282 \times 4 = 1128\) minutes.

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
- Since 60 minutes make 1 hour, \(1128 \div 60 = 18.8\) hours.

So, Britany spends \(\boxed{18.8 \text{ hours}}\) on TikTok in a month."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The base cost for the installation is $129.00. This cost includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

Now, Angela needs:
- 6 mirrors
- 2 chandeliers
- 20 pictures

First, we need to find out how many extra mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures Angela needs:
- Extra mirrors: \(6 - 4 = 2\)
- Extra chandeliers: \(2 - 1 = 1\)
- Extra pictures: \(20 - 10 = 10\)

The cost to install each extra item is $15.00. So, we calculate the extra cost:
- Cost for extra mirrors: \(2 \times 15 = 30\)
- Cost for extra chandeliers: \(1 \times 15 = 15\)
- Cost for extra pictures: \(10 \times 15 = 150\)

Now, we add the extra cost to the base cost:
- Total extra cost: \(30 + 15 + 150 = 195\)
- Total cost: \(129 + 195 = 324\)

So, the total cost for Angela is $324.00."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Eva has saved $20.00.

Next, Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva. So, we add $10.00 to Eva's savings:
\[ 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00 \]
So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

Now, Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much 40% of Anthony's savings is, we calculate:
\[ 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00 \]
So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony.

Adding this to Anthony's savings gives us Roy's total savings:
\[ 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00 \]

Therefore, Roy has saved $42.00."
"To figure out how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to follow the relationships given step by step.

1. Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we need to convert 480 inches into feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we divide 480 inches by 12:
\[
480 \div 12 = 40 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"To find out the total distance Mason has traveled, we need to add the distances from each part of his journey.

First, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the first part:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 4 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance he traveled in the second part:
- Speed: 8 miles per hour
- Time: 6 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Now, we add the distances from both parts to find the total distance:
- Total Distance = Distance of First Part + Distance of Second Part
- Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

So, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles. The correct answer is 80 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down in a simpler way.

If 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to travel across a highway, we can find out the distance by multiplying the number of kangaroos by the time they take and their speed. So, the distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = 3 \text{ kangaroos} \times 18 \text{ hours} = 54 \text{ kangaroo-hours} \]

Now, if we have 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, we need to find out how long it will take them to cover the same distance \(D\).

Since each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \). The total speed of 4 turtles working together is:
\[ 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v \]

The time \(t\) it takes for 4 turtles to cover the distance \(D\) is:
\[ t = \frac{D}{\text{total speed of turtles}} = \frac{54 \text{ kangaroo-hours}}{2v} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ hours} \]

So, it will take 4 turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

The final answer is:
\[

Kora made 20 clay dishes. Rory makes 20 more than Kora, so Rory made:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \text{ clay dishes} \]

Jada makes twice as many as Rory, so Jada made:
\[ 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ clay dishes} \]

Now, to find out how many they all made together, we add up the dishes:
\[ 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 \]

So, the total number of clay dishes they all made together is 140. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"Okay, let's break it down in a simpler way.

The new price of the laptop after trading in her old one is $600 - $200 = $400. Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, so she currently has $400 - $50 = $350.

She has already been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom will give her $80. So, the total amount of money she has from these sources is $150 + $80 = $230.

To find out how much money she has in her purse, we subtract the $230 she has from the $350 she needs. So, $350 - $230 = $120.

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{120}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Adam has 3 large apples, and each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces. So, from the large apples, he gets:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, Adam has 5 small apples, and each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces. So, from the small apples, he gets:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Now, if we add the slices from the large apples and the small apples, we get:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

So, the number of apple slices left is 15. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. First, we know that each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day.
2. The farmer currently has 3 cows, so they produce:
   \[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]
3. The farmer wants to produce 25 liters of milk a day.
4. To find out how much more milk is needed, we subtract the current production from the desired production:
   \[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]
5. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we need to find out how many more cows are needed to produce the additional 10 liters:
   \[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The answer is 2."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have three glue sticks, and we need to find out how much glue is left in each one.

1. The first glue stick has 1/6 left. So, the length of the glue left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

2. The second glue stick has 2/3 left. So, the length of the glue left is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

3. The third glue stick has 1/2 left. So, the length of the glue left is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ millimeters}
   \]

Now, we add up the lengths of the glue that is left:
\[
2 + 8 + 6 = 16 \text{ millimeters}
\]

So, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 16 millimeters. 

The correct answer is \boxed{16}."
"Gabriel needs $10000 for the car and $800 for the phone, so the total cost is $10000 + $800 = $10800. Gabriel has $5000 from working and his brother gave him $200, so he has a total of $5000 + $200 = $5200. To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he has from the total cost: $10800 - $5200 = $5600. 

So, Gabriel still needs $5600.

The correct answer is B) $5600."
"Thea bought a hat worth $70. She gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which is a total of 4 * $20 = $80. Since the hat cost $70, the change she should get is $80 - $70 = $10. 

So, the change Thea got is $10. 

The correct answer is $10."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, so he has:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each, so the cost is:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each, so the cost is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the squirt guns and the water balloons:
\[ 12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Craig has left, we subtract the total cost from his initial amount:
\[ 40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Craig has 19 dollars left. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{19} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jack has 60 dishes. According to the problem, Jack has twice as many dishes as socks. So, if we let the number of socks Jack has be \( S \), we can write:
\[ D = 2S \]
Since \( D = 60 \), we can substitute and solve for \( S \):
\[ 60 = 2S \]
\[ S = 30 \]
So, Jack has 30 socks.

The problem also says Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Since Jack has 30 socks, Peter has:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ socks} \]

Peter also has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, Peter has:
\[ \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ dishes} \]

Now, let's find the total number of items they have together:
- Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, so the total for Jack is:
\[ 30 + 60 = 90 \]
- Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes, so the total for Peter is:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Adding these together, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

So, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 180."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know there are 20 students in total. Out of these, 5 students are good at math only, and 8 students are good at English only. We need to find out how many students are good at both math and English.

First, let's add the students who are good at math only and those who are good at English only:
\[ 5 \text{ (math only)} + 8 \text{ (English only)} = 13 \]

This means 13 students are either good at math only, good at English only, or good at both. Since there are 20 students in total, the rest must be good at both subjects:
\[ 20 - 13 = 7 \]

So, 7 students are good at both math and English. Now, to find out how many students are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only to those who are good at both math and English:
\[ 5 \text{ (math only)} + 7 \text{ (both)} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students good at math is 12.

\[ \frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/group}} = 11 \text{ groups} \]

So, the number of groups that can perform in the concert is 11. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve this, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with simple interest. Here's how we do it:

1. **Identify the principal amount**: Brenda invested $300.
2. **Determine the interest rate**: The interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount, which is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% \) per year.
3. **Calculate the simple interest**: Simple interest is calculated as \( \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \). So, \( 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \).
4. **Break down the calculation**:
   - First, calculate \( 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \).
   - Then, multiply by 3: \( 675 \times 3 = 2025 \).
   - So, the simple interest earned over 3 years is $2025.
5. **Calculate the total amount**: Add the simple interest to the principal amount. \( 300 + 2025 = 2325 \).

Therefore, the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is $2325.

The correct answer is: **2325**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 40 white shirts in total. Half of them have collars, so:
\[ \text{White shirts with collars} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]
\[ \text{White shirts without collars} = 40 - 20 = 20 \]

We also have 50 floral shirts in total. 20 of them have buttons, so:
\[ \text{Floral shirts without buttons} = 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more floral shirts without buttons there are than white shirts without collars:
\[ \text{Difference} = 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, there are 10 more floral shirts without buttons than white shirts without collars. The final answer is 10."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray can hold 30 eggs. To find out how many trays he needs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs each tray can hold:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays} \]

Now, if each tray is sold for $2.5, we need to find out how much he will earn by selling all 30 trays. We do this by multiplying the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[ 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the farmer will earn $75 if he sells all the trays. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{75}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y. He sold 10 goats from Farm X and twice as many from Farm Y, which means he sold 20 goats from Farm Y.

First, let's find out how many goats are left in each farm after the sales:
- In Farm X, he started with 55 goats and sold 10, so he has \(55 - 10 = 45\) goats left.
- In Farm Y, he started with 45 goats and sold 20, so he has \(45 - 20 = 25\) goats left.

Now, to find out the total number of goats left in both farms, we add the remaining goats from Farm X and Farm Y:
\[45 + 25 = 70\]

So, the total number of goats left in the two farms altogether is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month. In a year, which has 12 months, he buys:
\[ 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year} \]

He spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find out how much he spends on each pair, we divide the total amount by the number of pairs:
\[ \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}} = 110 \text{ dollars/pair} \]

So, on average, James pays $110 for each pair of shoes. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{110} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, with a $2 discount on each basket of red food.

First, let's calculate the cost of the green food:
- Each basket of green food costs $25.
- So, 3 baskets of green food cost \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the red food with the discount:
- Each basket of red food costs $18, but with a $2 discount, it costs \(18 - 2 = 16\) dollars.
- So, 3 baskets of red food cost \(3 \times 16 = 48\) dollars.

Now, we add the cost of the green food and the cost of the red food to get the total cost:
- Total cost = cost of green food + cost of red food = \(75 + 48 = 123\) dollars.

So, the total amount you will have to pay is $123."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. We have 90 rooms at the motel, and we need to clean half of them. Half of 90 is 45 rooms.
2. It takes 20 minutes to clean one room. So, to clean 45 rooms, it would take \(45 \times 20 = 900\) minutes.
3. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to convert 900 minutes into hours. To do this, we divide 900 by 60, which gives us \(900 \div 60 = 15\) hours.

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms. The answer is 15 hours."
"Okay, let's go through the problem step by step again to find out how many homes the town will build over the next three years.

1. **First Year:**
   The town builds 12 homes.
   \[
   \text{Homes built in the first year} = 12
   \]

2. **Second Year:**
   They build three times the number of homes they built in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Homes built in the second year} = 3 \times 12 = 36
   \]

3. **Third Year:**
   They count the total number of homes built in the first two years and then double that total.
   \[
   \text{Total homes built in the first two years} = 12 + 36 = 48
   \]
   \[
   \text{Homes built in the third year} = 2 \times 48 = 96
   \]

4. **Total Homes Built Over Three Years:**
   Now, we add the homes built in each year to find the total.
   \[
   \text{Total homes built} = 12 + 36 + 96 = 144
   \]

So, the town will have built 144 homes over the next three years. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{144}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how old you are.

1. You are three years younger than your brother, so if your brother is \( B \) years old, you are \( B - 3 \) years old.
2. You are two years older than your sister, so if your sister is \( S \) years old, you are \( S + 2 \) years old.
3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so your mom is \( 3B - 1 \) years old.
4. The sum of all your ages is 87, so \( B - 3 + B + S + 3B - 1 = 87 \).

First, let's simplify the equation:
\[ B - 3 + B + S + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 5B + S - 4 = 87 \]
\[ 5B + S = 91 \]

Since you are both \( B - 3 \) and \( S + 2 \), we can set these equal to each other:
\[ B - 3 = S + 2 \]
\[ S = B - 5 \]

Now substitute \( S = B - 5 \) into the equation \( 5B + S = 91 \):
\[ 5B + (B - 5) = 91 \]
\[ 6B - 5 = 91 \]
\[ 6B = 96 \]
\[ B = 16 \]

So, your brother is 16 years old. Since you are three years younger than your brother:
\[ Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, you are 13 years old. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mr. Jackson has 27 students, and he wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. So, he needs:
\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

The glue sticks come in packs of 8. To find out how many packs he needs, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks in each pack:
\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he wants to have some extra glue sticks left over, he needs to round up to the next whole number. So, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

Therefore, the number of packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

On the first day, the river has 4000 gallons of water.

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. So, on the second day, the river has \(4000 \times 2 = 8000\) gallons of water.

On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons. So, the river has \(8000 + 6000 = 14000\) gallons of water.

Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is 14000 gallons.

The final answer is:
14000 gallons"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, we have 10 people infected. Each day, every infected person infects 6 others. So, we need to calculate the number of new infections each day and add them to the total number of infected people.

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total number of infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Now, there are 70 infected people.
- Each of these 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total number of infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Now, there are 490 infected people.
- Each of these 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total number of infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

So, after three days, the total number of infected people is 3430.

The final answer is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Rafaela got in tips. Since each of the 40 customers gave her $20, we multiply 40 by 20:

\[ 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rafaela got $800 in tips.

Next, we need to find out how much Julieta got. The problem says Julieta got 10% less than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's tips, we calculate:

\[ 10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Julieta got $80 less than $800, which means:

\[ 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much they got together, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips:

\[ 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of tips they received together is $1520. 

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1520}

"Jennifer bought 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, so that's 2 oranges × 3 daughters = 6 oranges. Her son got 3 oranges. So, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges. To find out how many oranges she has left, we subtract the oranges given away from the total she bought: 12 - 9 = 3 oranges. 

So, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges. The correct answer is 3."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Claire earns 1 badge every month. So in a year, which has 12 months, she earns:
\[ 1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges} \]

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire. So, Amber earns 1 badge every 2 months. In a year, which has 12 months, Amber earns:
\[ \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/badge}} = 6 \text{ badges} \]

Wendy earns 3 times the number of badges Claire earns in the same time. So, in a year, Wendy earns:
\[ 3 \times 12 \text{ badges} = 36 \text{ badges} \]

Now, to find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, we subtract the number of badges Amber earns from the number Wendy earns:
\[ 36 \text{ badges} - 6 \text{ badges} = 30 \text{ badges} \]

So, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year. The final answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Paige bakes banana bread from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, which is 5 hours. She can bake 2 loaves of banana bread every hour. So, in 5 hours, she bakes:
\[ 2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves} \]

Each loaf is cut into 8 slices, so:
\[ 10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices} \]

Each slice is sold for 50 cents, so:
\[ 80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount Paige raised is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The problem also tells us that she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So, if we let the number of silver coins be \( S \), we can write the equation:
\[ 70 = S + 30 \]

To find out how many silver coins she has, we need to solve for \( S \):
\[ S = 70 - 30 \]
\[ S = 40 \]

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of gold coins and the number of silver coins:
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. George ordered 600 burritos for the picnic.
2. There were 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos given to the students is:
   \[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]
3. Mr. George ate 20 burritos.
4. The total number of burritos eaten by the students and Mr. George is:
   \[ 500 \text{ burritos} + 20 \text{ burritos} = 520 \text{ burritos} \]
5. The number of leftover burritos is the total number of burritos ordered minus the number of burritos eaten:
   \[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 520 \text{ burritos} = 80 \text{ burritos} \]

So, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 80. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{80}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the rink has 12 red cars. Now, for the green cars, it says there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. So, we calculate the number of green cars as follows:
\[ 12 - 2 = 10 \]
So, there are 10 green cars.

Next, the number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. So, we calculate the number of blue cars as:
\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \]
So, there are 30 blue cars.

Now, we add up the red, green, and blue cars:
\[ 12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52 \]
So, there are 52 cars that are either red, green, or blue.

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find out how many yellow cars there are, we subtract the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[ 75 - 52 = 23 \]

Therefore, the number of yellow cars is 23. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that together Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books. Let's say Anne has \( A \) books. According to the problem, Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has \( A + 25 \) books. Also, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Fawn has \( A + 12 \) books.

The total number of books they have together is:
\[ (A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ A + 25 + A + A + 12 = 85 \]
\[ 3A + 37 = 85 \]

Subtract 37 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 48 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ A = 16 \]

So, Anne has 16 books. Now, to find out how many books Fawn has, we add 12 to the number of books Anne has:
\[ 16 + 12 = 28 \]

Therefore, Fawn has 28 books. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{28}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, Greg wants to make jello cups for 30 kids, and each kid should have 4 jello cups. So, we need to find out how many jello cups in total he needs:

\[ 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups} \]

Next, we know that one box of jello makes 10 jello cups. To find out how many boxes he needs, we divide the total number of jello cups by the number of jello cups one box makes:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes} \]

Each box of jello costs $1.25. So, to find out the total cost, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars per box} = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Greg will spend $15 on jello. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Madeline and Keenan together spend $400 a month on groceries. Madeline pays 60% of this amount, so we calculate how much she pays:

\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

This means Keenan pays the rest, which is:

\[ 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we need to find out how much Keenan spends in a week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4:

\[ \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Keenan spends $40 per week. The correct answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tobias started with 60 pieces of pizza.

1. On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the pieces:
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after the first day, he has:
   \[
   60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces left}
   \]

2. On the second day, he ate 10 pieces:
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces left}
   \]

3. On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces:
   \[
   \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{7 \times 26}{13} = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   So, after the third day, he has:
   \[
   26 - 14 = 12 \text{ pieces left}

\[ 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48 \]

So, 16 bolts cost $0.48. Now, we need to subtract this cost from the $12.48 David has:

\[ 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00 \]

So, after buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left. 

The final answer is:

First, we know she spent $400 on her hair.

Next, the cost of the manicure is one-fourth of the hair cost:
\[ \text{Cost of manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, the cost of the pedicure is three-fourths of the manicure cost:
\[ \text{Cost of pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is $575."
"Sarah sells a 20-meter rope for $2 per meter, so she gets $40. With $40, she wants to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. She can buy 26 meters of the new rope because 26 times $1.5 equals $39. 

So, after buying the new rope, she will have $40 - $39 = $1 left over. 

The final answer is $1."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, to find out her current age, we subtract 10 from 18:
\[ 18 - 10 = 8 \]
So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Now, we need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age. If her current age is 8, then three times her current age is:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

We need to find the number of years, \( y \), it will take for her age to be 24. We can set up the equation:
\[ 8 + y = 24 \]

To find \( y \), we subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ y = 24 - 8 \]
\[ y = 16 \]

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be three times her current age. The answer is:
\[ 16 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much each type of item costs.

1. **Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the total cost of the items from her budget:
\[
\text{Money left} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, Kelly has $5 left in her budget. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts and also includes a 15-minute encore. So, if her usual concert is \( x \) minutes long, then the final concert is \( 2x \) minutes long. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total time for the final concert is \( 2x + 15 \) minutes.

We are told that the total time for the final concert is 65 minutes. So, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2x + 15 = 65 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[ 2x = 65 - 15 \]
\[ 2x = 50 \]

2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{50}{2} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

So, the usual length of Elaina's concerts is 25 minutes.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Argo starts with 200 toys. He gives 40 toys to Alyssa, 80 toys to Bonnie, and 30 toys to Nicky. To find out how many toys Argo has left, we need to subtract the total number of toys given away from the initial number of toys.

The total number of toys given away is 40 + 80 + 30 = 150 toys.

So, the number of toys Argo has now is 200 - 150 = 50 toys.

The final answer is 50 toys."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.
On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.
On Friday, they make twice as many as on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 125 = 250\) chimichangas.

Now, we add up the chimichangas made on these three days:
\[ 125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 500 \]

So, the total number of chimichangas made on those three days is 500.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{500} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The singer has 50 microphones. He realizes that 20% of them won't fit. First, we need to find out how many microphones that is:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \]

So, 10 microphones won't fit. That means the number of microphones that can fit in pairs is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we need to pair these 40 microphones. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide 40 by 2:

\[ 40 \div 2 = 20 \]

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Jerry counts 6 birds nesting in the bushes. The number of birds flying overhead is 2/3 of the nesting birds, so:

\[
\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ birds}
\]

Jerry also counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding. So:

\[
3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ birds}
\]

Now, we add up all the birds:

\[
6 \text{ (nesting)} + 4 \text{ (flying)} + 24 \text{ (feeding)} = 34 \text{ birds}
\]

So, the total number of birds Jerry counts is 34. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"Lani baked 55 cookies and ate 5 of them, so she had:

\[ 55 - 5 = 50 \text{ cookies} \]

She then put these 50 cookies into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies were in each jar, we divide the number of cookies by the number of jars:

\[ \frac{50}{5} = 10 \]

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar. The number of cookies in each jar is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Joelle has 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals. So, the total number of petals on the orchids is:
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Joelle also has 4 African daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals. So, the total number of petals on the daisies is:
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

Now, to find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the number of petals on the orchids from the number of petals on the daisies:
\[ 40 \text{ petals (daisies)} - 25 \text{ petals (orchids)} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a clearer explanation.

We start with 100 plants in Mrs. Smith's garden. One-fourth of these are indoor plants, so we calculate:

1. **Number of indoor plants:**
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25
   \]

Next, we subtract the indoor plants from the total to find out how many plants are left:

2. **Remaining plants:**
   \[
   100 - 25 = 75
   \]

From these remaining plants, two-thirds are outdoor plants:

3. **Number of outdoor plants:**
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50
   \]

Now, we subtract the outdoor plants from the remaining plants to find out how many are flowering plants:

4. **Number of flowering plants:**
   \[
   75 - 50 = 25
   \]

Finally, to find out what percentage of the total plants are flowering plants, we use the formula:

5. **Percentage of flowering plants:**
   \[
   \left( \frac{25}{100} \right) \times 100 = 25\%
   \]

So, the percentage of flowering plants is 25%."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and that it spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob. So, to find out how fast a thingamabob spins, we divide 121 by 11:

\[ 121 \div 11 = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we know that a whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob. So, we multiply the speed of the thingamabob by 5:

\[ 11 \times 5 = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

So, a whirligig spins at 55 meters per second. The final answer is:

\[ 55 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day. The salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3.

Now, let's add up the cost of the salad and the yogurt:
\[ 6 + 3 = 9 \]

Ellen pays a total of $11 for all her food every day. So, the cost of the two carrots must be:
\[ 11 - 9 = 2 \]

Since she eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is:
\[ 2 / 2 = 1 \]

So, the cost of one carrot every day is $1.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Mark used to make $10 an hour, but his pay was raised by $2, so now he makes $12 an hour. He works 8 hours a day and does this for 5 days a week. 

First, we find out how many hours he works in a week:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

Next, we calculate how much he makes in a week by multiplying his new hourly wage by the number of hours he works:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, Mark makes $480 a week. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{480} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Tasha made a total of $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns. We know she mowed Joe's lawn 6 times because Joe paid her $6 for it. So, if she mowed Joe's lawn 6 times, and she mowed Kamala's lawn 3 times as many times as Joe's, that means she mowed Kamala's lawn \(3 \times 6 = 18\) times. For Alba's lawn, she mowed it 5 times as many times as Joe's, so that's \(5 \times 6 = 30\) times.

Now, let's add up all the money she made from mowing lawns:
- Joe's lawn: $6
- Kamala's lawn: \(18 \times \text{price per mow}\)
- Alba's lawn: \(30 \times \text{price per mow}\)

Since we know the total she made from mowing lawns is part of her total earnings of $80, we can calculate the money she made from mowing lawns by subtracting the $6 she got from mowing Joe's lawn from $80. So, \(80 - 6 = 74\).

Therefore, the amount she made from selling lemonade is $74. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{74} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so:
   \[ 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so:
   \[ 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so:
   \[ 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, Harry's weight is 74 kg. The correct answer is 74 kg."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

John rents his car 10 times a month, and each time he rents it for 3 hours. So, the total number of hours he rents his car in a month is:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

He gets $25 for each hour he rents his car. So, his total earnings in a month are:
\[ 30 \times 25 = 750 \text{ dollars} \]

John's car payment is $500 a month. To find out his profit, we subtract the car payment from his earnings:
\[ 750 - 500 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John makes a profit of $250 a month. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Martha originally had some notebooks, and we don't know exactly how many, but we know she bought 5 more notebooks to have a total of 7 notebooks. So, if we subtract the 5 notebooks she bought from the total, we can find out how many she originally had:

\[ 7 - 5 = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can calculate the number of notebooks Joseph had:

\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number Martha has:

\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

So, Martha has 1 more notebook than Joseph. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Dijana rowed 50 miles. Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how much more Anis rowed, we calculate 1/5 of 50 miles:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
\]

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. Therefore, the total distance Anis rowed is:

\[
50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Now, to find the total distance both rowed, we add Dijana's and Anis's distances together:

\[
50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Susan made 100 cookies and wanted to give them equally to her 6 nephews. But before she could do that, her husband took 4 cookies for himself. So, we need to figure out how many cookies are left and then see how many each nephew gets.

First, we subtract the 4 cookies the husband took from the 100 cookies:
\[ 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Now, we need to divide these 96 cookies equally among her 6 nephews:
\[ 96 \div 6 = 16 \]

So, each nephew gets 16 cookies. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"Okay, let's go through the problem again step by step to make sure we understand it clearly.

1. Yesterday, Denise read 10 pages and Daniel read 13 pages.
2. Today, Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel did yesterday. Since Daniel read 13 pages yesterday, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.
3. Daniel was not able to read any pages today, so he read 0 pages today.
4. Now, let's add up the pages each of them read:
   - Denise read \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages in total.
   - Daniel read \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages in total.
5. To find out how many more pages Denise read than Daniel, we subtract the total pages Daniel read from the total pages Denise read: \(28 - 13 = 15\).

So, Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel. The final answer is 15."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Calvin is making soup for his family. The pot can fill 4 adult bowls or 8 child's bowls. Calvin is an adult, so he can fill the pot with 4 adult bowls. His wife is also an adult, and they have two children. So, the family needs 4 bowls in total: 1 for Calvin, 1 for his wife, and 2 for the children.

Since the pot can fill 4 adult bowls, and the family needs 4 bowls, all the bowls will be used up. There will be no bowls left over.

So, each child can only have one bowl of soup because all the bowls are used up. Therefore, each child can have a bowl of soup **0 times**.

The final answer is:

"Okay, let me break it down for you in a simpler way.

William bought five notebooks, and each notebook costs $1.50. So, the total cost for the notebooks is:
\[ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 \]

He also bought one ballpen, and each ballpen costs $0.50. So, the cost for the ballpen is:
\[ 1 \times 0.50 = 0.50 \]

Now, to find out how much William spent in all, we add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen together:
\[ 7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00 \]

So, William spent a total of $8.00. The correct answer is:

\[

"To figure out how much material Jo needs, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to know how much material is needed for one small mask and one large mask.

1. **Material for one small mask:**
   - Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   - So, for one small mask, she needs:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
     \]

2. **Material for one large mask:**
   - Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   - So, for one large mask, she needs:
     \[
     \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
     \]

Now, let's calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

3. **Total material for 20 small masks:**
   - Material per small mask: 0.5 yards
   - Total material for 20 small masks:
     \[
     20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards per mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
     \]

4. **Total material for 8 large masks:**
   - Material per large mask: 0.75 yards
   - Total material for 8 large masks:
     \[
     8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards per mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
     \]

Finally, we add the material needed for both types of masks to find the total material required.

5. **Total material needed:**
   \[
   10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
   \]

So, Jo would need \(\boxed{16}\) yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks."
"To find the average price per ticket, we first need to figure out the total number of tickets Deepa has bought. She has seen each of the 9 movies 3 times, so the total number of tickets is:

\[ 9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ tickets} \]

Deepa spent a total of $216 on these tickets. To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \frac{216}{27} = 8 \]

So, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so that's 10 - 2 = 8 hours. He also walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, let's add up all the time he spends on these activities:
- Sleeping: 10 hours
- Working: 8 hours
- Walking the dog: 1 hour

So, 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 hours.

There are 24 hours in a day, so to find out how much free time he has, we subtract the time he spends on activities from the total hours in a day:
24 - 19 = 5 hours.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time left in his day. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Tim starts with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.

First, he uses 3 blue shoe boxes. So, the number of blue shoe boxes left is:
\[ 7 - 3 = 4 \]

Next, he uses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his red shoe boxes. The number of red shoe boxes used is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \]

So, the number of red shoe boxes left is:
\[ 9 - 3 = 6 \]

Now, we add the remaining blue and red shoe boxes:
\[ 4 \text{ (blue)} + 6 \text{ (red)} = 10 \]

So, the total number of blue and red shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Duncan's current age is 60. Eight years ago, Duncan's age was:
\[ 60 - 8 = 52 \]

We are told that eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago. So, four years ago, Adam's age was:
\[ \frac{52}{2} = 26 \]

Since four years ago Adam was 26, his current age is:
\[ 26 + 4 = 30 \]

Now, to find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ 30 + 8 = 38 \]

So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm. So, we first find out how big Farmer Smith's farm is:

1. Twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm is \(2 \times 200 = 400\) acres.
2. Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than 400 acres, so it's \(400 + 100 = 500\) acres.

Now, to find the total number of acres for both farms, we add the size of Farmer Brown's farm to the size of Farmer Smith's farm:

\[200 + 500 = 700\]

So, the total number of acres for both farms together is 700 acres. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{700} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Colby gets paid $0.20 for each package he completes. He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so he completes:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour} \]

In an eight-hour workday, he completes:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Since he earns $0.20 for each package, his total earnings for the day are:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Colby earns in a typical eight-hour workday is $64."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John drinks one bottle of water every half hour. A normal Sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes. Since 45 minutes is three half-hours (because 45 divided by 15 equals 3), he drinks 3 bottles of water for a normal Sudoku.

Now, an extreme Sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal one. So, an extreme Sudoku takes \(45 \times 4 = 180\) minutes.

To find out how many half-hours are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30 (since there are 30 minutes in a half-hour). So, \(180 \div 30 = 6\).

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water for an extreme Sudoku.

The final answer is: **6**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon. He threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna, and there were 20 red balloons.

First, we calculate how many pieces of bologna were used for the red balloons:
\[ 2 \text{ pieces/bologna} \times 20 \text{ red balloons} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Now, we subtract the pieces used for the red balloons from the total pieces to find out how many pieces were used for the yellow balloons:
\[ 58 \text{ total pieces} - 40 \text{ pieces for red} = 18 \text{ pieces for yellow} \]

Since each yellow balloon uses 3 pieces of bologna, we can find out how many yellow balloons there are by dividing the pieces used for yellow balloons by 3:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ pieces}}{3 \text{ pieces/bologna}} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons} \]

So, the number of yellow balloons is 6. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

Jon drives 100 miles each day. If he drives for 30 days, the total distance he covers is:
\[ 100 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ miles} \]

His car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. To find out how many tune-ups he needs, we divide the total miles by 1000:
\[ \frac{3000 \text{ miles}}{1000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3 \text{ tune-ups} \]

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Sure, let's calculate the total hours Bruce works over the three days step by step.

On Tuesday, Bruce works 5 hours.
On Wednesday, he works twice the time he worked on Tuesday, so that's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) hours.
On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than what he worked on Wednesday, so that's \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.

Now, to find the total hours worked over the three days, we add up the hours from each day:
\[ 5 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 10 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 8 \text{ (Thursday)} = 23 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total number of hours Bruce works in these three days is 23 hours."
"To find out how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to add up all the money they spent and then divide it by 2.

First, let's break down the costs:
- The cake costs $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. Since the balloons cost $0.5 for 2 balloons, the cost for 12 balloons is \(12 \times \frac{0.5}{2} = 12 \times 0.25 = 3\) dollars.
- They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) dollars.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
\[ 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges. That makes a total of 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit. If Lola ate 2 pieces, then the number of pieces left is 14 - 2 = 12 pieces.

So, the number of pieces left is 12."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 6 students playing tennis.
2. For volleyball, it says there are twice as many students as playing tennis. So, we calculate:
   \[
   2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ students}
   \]
3. Now, we add the number of students playing tennis and volleyball:
   \[
   6 + 12 = 18 \text{ students}
   \]
4. Next, we look at the soccer players. There are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, so:
   \[
   16 + 22 = 38 \text{ students}
   \]
5. To find the total number of students, we add the students from tennis, volleyball, and soccer:
   \[
   18 + 38 = 56 \text{ students}
   \]

So, the total number of students is 56. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{56}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many lollipops were sold in total. There are 30 students, and each student sold an average of 10 lollipops. So, we multiply the number of students by the average number of lollipops each student sold:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Next, we calculate the total money made from selling these lollipops. Each lollypop was sold for $0.8:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Now, we need to find out how much it cost to buy all the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total money made:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

So, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

Larry has 3 cats. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has \(3 \times 3 = 9\) dogs. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has \(9 - 2 = 7\) rabbits. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has \(3 \times 7 = 21\) fish. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has \(\frac{21}{3} = 7\) gerbils.

Now, let's add them all up:
- Cats: 3
- Dogs: 9
- Rabbits: 7
- Fish: 21
- Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets = \(3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47\)

So, Larry has 47 pets in total."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have a loaf of bread with 24 slices. Abby can eat 2 slices a day, and Josh can eat twice as much as Abby, so Josh can eat 4 slices a day.

Together, they eat:
\[ 2 \text{ slices (Abby)} + 4 \text{ slices (Josh)} = 6 \text{ slices per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days the 24 slices will last if they eat 6 slices each day:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices per day}} = 4 \text{ days} \]

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Martha starts collecting shells when she's 5 years old and she collects one shell every month. By the time she's 10 years old, that's 5 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of months she's been collecting shells by multiplying 5 years by 12 months per year:

\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Since she collects one shell each month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is:

\[ 60 \text{ shells} \]

So, the final answer is:
\[ 60 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She uses 15 of these cups to brew cinnamon tea, so she has 27 - 15 = 12 cups left for chamomile and mint tea.

These 12 cups are split equally between chamomile and mint tea, so she brews 12 / 2 = 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea.

Now, she divides these 27 cups into 3 rows equally. So, each row has 27 / 3 = 9 cups of tea.

Since the cups in each row are split equally between chamomile and mint tea, each row has 9 / 2 = 4.5 cups of mint tea.

So, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is 4.5. 

The final answer is: **4.5**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

The sloth takes 4 hours to go down to the ground and pick up berries, then climb back up. So in 8 hours, which is double the time it takes for one trip, the sloth can make 2 trips.

If the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips he can make in that time:

\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is 12 berries.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

First, we know the pool has 10000 gallons of water. The tank gets filled with half of that, so the tank gets 5000 gallons of water.

Now, the tank loses water at a rate of 500 gallons per day. We need to find out how much water is left after 6 days.

In 6 days, the tank loses:
\[ 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the amount of water left in the tank after 6 days is:
\[ 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is 2000 gallons.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Colby has $150 to spend on movies. He already spent money on popcorn and candy. He bought 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each, so that's $16. He also bought 4 boxes of candy at $2 each, so that's $8. In total, he spent $16 + $8 = $24 on popcorn and candy.

Now, he has $150 - $24 = $126 left to spend on more movies.

Since it's the last day of the month and it's a Friday, he can only see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday. A movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday costs $10.

So, with $126 left, he can see 126 / 10 = 12 movies (since he can't buy a fraction of a movie).

Therefore, the number of additional movies he can see is 12.

The correct answer is: **12**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many calories are in a mini cinnamon roll and a mini blueberry muffin. Since a mini pastry has 1/3 of the calories of a normal version:

- A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories. So, a mini cinnamon roll has \(600 \div 3 = 200\) calories.
- A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories. So, a mini blueberry muffin has \(450 \div 3 = 150\) calories.

Now, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls and mini blueberry muffins:

- Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, and each has 200 calories, so the total calories from cinnamon rolls is \(200 \times 200 = 40000\) calories.
- Andrew also baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, and each has 150 calories, so the total calories from blueberry muffins is \(300 \times 150 = 45000\) calories.

To find the total calories from all the pastries, we add the calories from the cinnamon rolls and the blueberry muffins together:
\[40000 + 45000 = 85000\]

So, the total number of calories from all the pastries is 85000. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{85000}\)"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to add up all the Junebugs she picked over the week. Let's do that step by step.

On Monday, she picked 39 Junebugs.
On Tuesday, she picked twice as many as Monday, so that's \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs.
On Wednesday, she also picked twice as many as Monday, so that's another 78 Junebugs.
On Thursday, she picked 48 Junebugs.
On Friday, she picked 57 Junebugs.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:
\[39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57\]

Adding them step by step:
\[39 + 78 = 117\]
\[117 + 78 = 195\]
\[195 + 48 = 243\]
\[243 + 57 = 299\]

So, the total number of Junebugs picked over the week is 299.

To find the average number of Junebugs picked per day, we divide the total by the number of days, which is 5:
\[299 \div 5 = 59.8\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs Rita picks per day is 59.8. The correct answer is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how far the bus traveled. The bus travels at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. So, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate how far the car traveled. The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. So, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how much farther the bus traveled than the car, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled:

\[ 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

So, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The final answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Sophie had some toys before she bought the bouncy balls. She had 31 building blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 stacking rings. So, the total number of toys she had before was:
\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Now, Sophie has a total of 62 toys. To find out how many bouncy balls she bought, we need to subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:
\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

So, Sophie bought 14 bouncy balls.

The number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, and Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

First, let's say Jean's age is \( J \). Then Paul's age \( Pa \) would be \( J + 10 \) because Paul is 10 years older than Jean.

Peter's age \( P \) is the sum of Paul's and Jean's ages, so \( P = Pa + J = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 \).

Now, we know the total age is 100, so:
\[ P + Pa + J = 100 \]
Substituting \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \):
\[ (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100 \]
\[ 2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \]
\[ 4J + 20 = 100 \]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 4J = 80 \]
Divide by 4:
\[ J = 20 \]

So Jean is 20 years old. Now we can find Paul's age:
\[ Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

And Peter's age:
\[ P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, Peter is 50 years old. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. So, that's \(4 \times 2 = 8\) water balloons.
2. Maria also got 1 water balloon for herself.
3. So, before her mom gave more balloons, they had \(8 + 1 = 9\) water balloons in total.

Now, her mom gave each person 3 more water balloons. There are 5 people in total (Maria and her 4 friends), so that's \(5 \times 3 = 15\) more water balloons.

Adding the initial 9 water balloons to the 15 more water balloons, we get \(9 + 15 = 24\) water balloons in total.

So, the total number of water balloons the girls had is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of stuff they have in total. There are 10 people who each donate 5 boxes, so that's:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes} \]

They also have 10 boxes already. So, the total number of boxes is:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes} \]

Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff. To find out how many tables they need, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes each table can hold:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables} \]

They already have 15 tables. To find out how many more tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already have from the total number of tables needed:
\[ 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ tables} \]

So, they need 15 new tables. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Zoey and Sydney.

Zoey has 40 seeds, and each seed is spit 10 feet. So, the total distance Zoey spits is:
\[ 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Sydney has 35 seeds, and each seed is spit 12 feet. So, the total distance Sydney spits is:
\[ 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we add the total distances spat by both:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet} = 820 \text{ feet} \]

To find the average total distance, we divide the sum by 2:
\[ \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{410}

"To figure out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many widgets each machine can make in a day and then in a month.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes 60 widgets per hour.
- It runs 24 hours a day.
- So, in a day, it makes \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.
- In a month (30 days), it makes \(1440 \times 30 = 43200\) widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes 45 widgets per hour.
- It also runs 24 hours a day.
- So, in a day, it makes \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.
- In a month (30 days), it makes \(1080 \times 30 = 32400\) widgets.

Now, let's calculate the money each machine makes by selling the widgets at $6 each.

For the Widgeteer 3000:
- It makes \(43200\) widgets in a month.
- So, the money it makes is \(43200 \times 6 = \$259200\).

For the WidgetMaster 9000:
- It makes \(32400\) widgets in a month.
- So, the money it makes is \(32400 \times 6 = \$194400\).

To find out how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 makes compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
- The difference is \(259200 - 194400 = \$64800\).

So, Fern will make \$64800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{64800}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for Cameron's stay at the hotel.

1. **24-hour option**: This costs 1600 pesos.
2. **12-hour plus additional hours option**:
   - The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
   - After 12 hours, Cameron stays for 5 more hours. Each additional hour costs 70 pesos, so 5 hours cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.
   - Adding these together, the total cost is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, to find out how much Cameron saves, we subtract the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option from the cost of the 24-hour option:
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

So, Cameron would save **250 pesos**."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much hay each sheep needs. Each goat gets 5 pounds of hay. Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. So, we calculate it like this:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we know there are 15 goats and each needs 5 pounds of hay. So, the total hay for the goats is:

\[
15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we have 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay. So, the total hay for the sheep is:

\[
12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find out the total amount of hay Nate needs, we add the hay for the goats and the sheep together:

\[
75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

So, Nate needs 159 pounds of hay. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{159}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

John earns $50 per hour and works 6 hours, so his total earnings are:
\[ 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars} \]

After spending $50 on gas, he has:
\[ 300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

He wants to deposit $100 in the bank, so he has:
\[ 250 - 100 = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

He buys 5 pencils at $10 each, so the cost is:
\[ 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the pencils, he has:
\[ 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, he wants to buy pens that cost $25 each. With $100, he can buy:
\[ \frac{100}{25} = 4 \text{ pens} \]

So, the number of pens he can buy is 4. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Craig spelled out 20 words, and each word had 15 letters. So, the total number of letters Craig spelled out is:
\[ 20 \times 15 = 300 \]

Craig's brother spelled out words with a total of 50 more letters than Craig. So, the total number of letters Craig's brother spelled out is:
\[ 300 + 50 = 350 \]

Now, to find the total number of letters spelled out by both Craig and his brother, we add the two totals together:
\[ 300 + 350 = 650 \]

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{650} \]"
"To find out how many children can be in the drill, we need to calculate the total number of children based on the given information.

First, let's break it down:
- There are 8 children in each row.
- There are 7 rows for each school.
- There are 5 different schools.

So, we start by finding out how many children are in one school:
- Number of children in one school = Number of children in one row × Number of rows per school
- Number of children in one school = 8 children/row × 7 rows
- Number of children in one school = 56 children

Next, we find out the total number of children for all the schools:
- Total number of children = Number of children in one school × Number of schools
- Total number of children = 56 children/school × 5 schools
- Total number of children = 280 children

So, the total number of children in the drill is 280. 

The correct answer is 280."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

The teacher has 9 coupons, and each coupon can be used to get 100 bottles of apple juice. So, the teacher can get:
\[ 9 \times 100 = 900 \text{ bottles} \]

There are 29 students in the class, and each student gets 2 bottles of apple juice. So, the total number of bottles given to the students is:
\[ 29 \times 2 = 58 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, to find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles the teacher got:
\[ 900 - 58 = 842 \text{ bottles} \]

So, the teacher has 842 bottles of apple juice for herself. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{842}
\]"
"To find out how much Patty charged, we need to add up all the costs for the job.

First, we have a fixed visit fee of $40.

Next, we calculate the labor cost. The job took 2.25 hours, and the labor cost is $35 per hour. So, we multiply 2.25 by 35:
\[ 2.25 \times 35 = 78.75 \]

Then, we add the cost of parts, which is $60.

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[ 40 + 78.75 + 60 = 178.75 \]

So, Patty charged $178.75. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{178.75} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

James gets 10 new CDs, and each CD costs $15. So, the total cost before any discount is:
\[ 10 \times 15 = 150 \]

He gets a 40% discount on these CDs. To find out how much the discount is, we calculate:
\[ 40\% \text{ of } 150 = 0.40 \times 150 = 60 \]

So, the total cost after the discount is:
\[ 150 - 60 = 90 \]

James decides to sell 5 of the CDs he doesn't like for $40. The cost of these 5 CDs is:
\[ 5 \times 15 = 75 \]

The money he gets from selling these CDs is $40, so the loss is:
\[ 75 - 40 = 35 \]

So, the total amount of money James was out is:
\[ 35 \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Jen has 6 yams, and each yam is sold for $1.5. So, the total money from the yams is:
\[ 6 \times 1.5 = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, she has 10 sweet potatoes, and each sweet potato is sold for $2. So, the total money from the sweet potatoes is:
\[ 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, she has 4 carrots, and each carrot is sold for $1.25. So, the total money from the carrots is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add up all the money she gets from selling the yams, sweet potatoes, and carrots:
\[ 9 + 20 + 5 = 34 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Jen will earn $34 if she sells everything. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

James has to swim across a 20-mile lake. He swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour. He swims 60% of the distance, which is:

\[ 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to swim 12 miles. Since he swims at 2 miles per hour, the time taken to swim 12 miles is:

\[ \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

After swimming 12 miles, he rests for half as long as the swimming time. So, the rest time is:

\[ \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Now, he has to swim the remaining distance, which is:

\[ 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles} \]

Since he swims at half the speed after resting, his new speed is:

\[ \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour} \]

So, the time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles is:

\[ \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours} \]

Adding all these times together, the total time taken is:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time it took James to get across the lake is 17 hours. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. The bakery has 40 less than seven times as many loaves as Sam had. So, we need to calculate seven times 70 and then subtract 40 from that number.

First, calculate seven times 70:
\[ 7 \times 70 = 490 \]

Next, subtract 40 from 490:
\[ 490 - 40 = 450 \]

So, the bakery has 450 loaves of bread. The final answer is:

\[ 450 \]"
"Jasmine started with 15 stickers. She lost 7 during playtime, so she had:

\[ 15 - 7 = 8 \]

Then, her teacher gave her 5 more stickers, so she had:

\[ 8 + 5 = 13 \]

So, at the end, Jasmine has 13 stickers. The correct answer is 13."
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Cayley sells newspapers and gets a commission on each one. He gets 10% on the New York Times and 8% on the Wall Street Journal. Each New York Times costs $5 and each Wall Street Journal costs $15.

First, let's find out how much commission Cayley gets from selling New York Times. He sells 6 of them:
- Commission per New York Times = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
- Total commission from New York Times = 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, let's find out how much commission he gets from selling Wall Street Journal. He sells 10 of them:
- Commission per Wall Street Journal = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal = 10 * $1.20 = $12.

Now, we add the two amounts together to get the total commission:
- Total commission = $3 + $12 = $15.

So, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know Deanna is 26 years old.
2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is \(26 - 5 = 21\) years old.
3. Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo must be twice Marcus's age. Therefore, Leo is \(21 \times 2 = 42\) years old.

So, the final answer is that Leo is 42 years old."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar. So if we let Azibo's points be \( A \), then Bahati's points would be \( A + 20 \) and Dinar's points would be \( A + 10 \).

The total points scored by all three is 45. So we can write the equation:
\[ A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45 \]
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]

Now, we solve for \( A \):
\[ 3A + 30 - 30 = 45 - 30 \]
\[ 3A = 15 \]
\[ A = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ A = 5 \]

So, Azibo scored 5 points. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 1 inch of paper has 100 pages, and the book is 1.5 inches thick. Since each page is printed on both sides, we need to figure out how many pages are in 1.5 inches of paper.

First, we calculate the number of pages in 1 inch:
- 1 inch = 100 pages

Now, we need to find out how many pages are in 1.5 inches:
- 1.5 inches = 1.5 × 100 pages = 150 pages

So, the book has 150 pages. 

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{150}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain this step-by-step in a simpler way.

Vince starts stapling reports at 8:00 AM and stops at 11:00 PM. That's a total of 16 hours. We need to convert those hours into minutes because Vince's stapling speed is given in minutes.

16 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 960 minutes.

Now, Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 960 minutes, we divide:

960 minutes / 15 minutes/interval = 64 intervals.

Since he staples 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we multiply the number of intervals by 30:

64 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1920 reports.

So, Vince stapled a total of 1920 reports. The final answer is 1920."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours. Converting hours to minutes, that's 480 minutes.

On the day in question, she sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m. That's 23 minutes.

She also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual, so she woke up at 5:55 a.m. instead of 6 a.m. That's an extra 5 minutes.

So, the total time she was awake is from 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m., which is 7 hours and 55 minutes. Converting this to minutes, it's 475 minutes.

Now, we need to subtract the time she was sleepwalking and the time she woke up early from her total sleep time.

Sleepwalking time: 23 minutes
Waking up early: 5 minutes
Total time not sleeping: 23 + 5 = 28 minutes

Actual sleep time: 480 minutes - 28 minutes = 452 minutes.

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day. The answer is \(\boxed{452}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups. Since one dozen is 12, two dozen is:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \]
So, Jonathan has 24 measuring cups.

Next, we need to find out how many measuring spoons he has. The problem says he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. So, we calculate:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \]
Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

Now, Jonathan gives 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. So, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:
\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Finally, to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:
\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

So, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The hospital has a total of 1000 beds. If 1/5 of these beds are occupied, we can calculate the number of occupied beds as follows:

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

So, the number of unoccupied beds initially is:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

Now, the hospital admits 50 new patients each day. Over 2 weeks, there are 14 days, so the total number of new patients admitted is:

\[
\text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

Adding these new patients to the initial occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900
\]

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total occupied beds from the total number of beds:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100
\]

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Robyn sends 16 emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails. So, the rest are:
\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \]
emails that are not work emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are sent to her family. So, the number of emails sent to her family is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

This means the number of emails left after sending emails to her family is:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of these 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. So, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We know Aliya is 3 years old. Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Now, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old. 

The final answer is: **45**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Courtney said there were 48 people at the concert. Kelly said Courtney might have overstated the number by 20%. To find out the actual number of people, we need to figure out what 20% of 48 is and then subtract that from 48.

First, let's calculate 20% of 48:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 48 = \frac{20}{100} \times 48 = 0.20 \times 48 = 9.6 \]

So, if Courtney overstated by 9.6, we subtract that from 48 to find the actual number:
\[ 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 \]

Since the number of people can't be a fraction, and considering the context of a concert where you can't have a fraction of a person, we round to the nearest whole number. But in this case, the options provided are whole numbers, so we look for the closest whole number to 38.4, which is 38.

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Jason carried 2 balls. According to the problem, Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \(2 \times 2 = 4\) balls. Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jeffrey carried \(2 \div 2 = 1\) ball.

Now, let's add up all the balls they carried:
- Jeffrey carried 1 ball.
- Jason carried 2 balls.
- Jordan carried 4 balls.

So, the total number of balls is \(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\).

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
On the third day, they dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net increase was 8 - 2 = 6 holes.

So, by the end of the third day, the total number of holes they had dug is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

By the end of the third day, the island had 4 times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since there were 10 holes at the end of the first day, the island had:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes} \]

By the end of the third day, they had 29 holes, so the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

So, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day is 11. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Amora and Lainey each got 70 corn chips. Collins got 15 more than what Amora and Lainey got, so Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.

Now, to find out the total number of corn chips, we add up what each person got:
70 (Amora) + 70 (Lainey) + 85 (Collins) = 225

So, the total number of corn chips is 225.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Jen needs to pay $400 for supplies. The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies. To find out how much the tickets cost, we first need to calculate 50% of $400.

50% of $400 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. Adding this to the cost of the supplies:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost for the travel is $600.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{600} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler numbers.

We know that together they have caught 339 Pokemon. Let's use the relationships given:

1. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan.
2. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.
3. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339.

Let's say Adelwolfe has caught \( A \) Pokemon. Then Stan has caught \( 4A - 13 \) Pokemon, and Alex has caught \( 4A - 13 + 5 = 4A - 8 \) Pokemon.

The total number of Pokemon they have caught is:
\[ A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \]
\[ 9A - 21 = 339 \]

Add 21 to both sides:
\[ 9A = 360 \]

Divide by 9:
\[ A = 40 \]

So Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon. Now we can find out how many Stan has caught:
\[ 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 \]

Therefore, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{147}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know each episode is 20 minutes long. The problem tells us there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. So, if each episode is 20 minutes, then the number of episodes would be:

\[ \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{\text{Minutes per episode}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Now, to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the minutes per episode:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{Minutes per episode} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"To find the total distance the bird traveled, we need to add up the distances of each part of her journey.

1. For the first part of the journey, the bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. The distance is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. For the second part, the bird flies for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. The distance is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. For the third part, the bird flies for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. The distance is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 22 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 110 \text{ miles}
   \]

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
\[
300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 446 miles. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{446}
\]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many brownies Greta has left.

1. Greta made a batch for herself, which is 1 dozen brownies. Since 1 dozen equals 12 brownies, she has 12 brownies.
2. At her office party, she got 1/2 dozen brownies. Since 1/2 dozen equals 6 brownies, she gets 6 more brownies.
3. At her friends' surprise party, she got 4 dozen brownies. Since 4 dozen equals 48 brownies, she gets 48 more brownies.
4. So, the total number of brownies she has before the party is:
   \[
   12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]
5. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 1/2 dozen equals 18 brownies, 18 brownies were eaten.
6. To find out how many brownies are left, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies:
   \[
   66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

So, the number of brownies Greta has left over from the entire day is 48. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{48}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Nani is 8 years old. His brother is twice his age, so his brother is:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old} \]

Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, her age is:
\[ 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ years old} \]

Now, to find the total age of all three family members, we add their ages together:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \text{ years} \]

So, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time for each type of racquet and then add them up.

First, let's calculate the time for the synthetic gut racquets:
- Andy has 3 racquets that need to be strung with synthetic gut.
- It takes him 15 minutes to string each synthetic gut racquet.
- So, the total time for synthetic gut racquets is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time for the polyester string racquets:
- Andy has 5 racquets that need to be strung with polyester string.
- It takes him 22 minutes to string each polyester string racquet.
- So, the total time for polyester string racquets is \(5 \times 22 = 110\) minutes.

Finally, let's calculate the time for the hybrid sets:
- Andy has 4 racquets that need to be strung with a hybrid set.
- It takes him 18 minutes to string each hybrid set racquet.
- So, the total time for hybrid sets is \(4 \times 18 = 72\) minutes.

Now, we add up all the times:
- Total time = time for synthetic gut + time for polyester string + time for hybrid sets
- Total time = 45 minutes + 110 minutes + 72 minutes
- Total time = 227 minutes

So, it will take Andy 227 minutes to string all the racquets. The correct answer is 227 minutes."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John wants to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. That makes a total of 4 phones. The first two phones cost $600 each. The third and fourth phones are half price, so each costs $600 / 2 = $300.

So, the cost for the first two phones is:
\[ 600 + 600 = 1200 \]

The cost for the next two phones (third and fourth) is:
\[ 300 + 300 = 600 \]

Now, we add the cost of the first two phones to the cost of the next two phones:
\[ 1200 + 600 = 1800 \]

So, the total amount John paid for all the phones is $1800.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1800}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We know that Carlton's team has 13 players. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team. So, to find out how many players are on Zeke's team, we add 7 to 13:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

So, Zeke's team has 20 players.

Now, to find out the total number of players in both teams combined, we add the number of players on both teams:

\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

So, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33.

The final answer is:
\[ 33 \]"
"To find out how many wooden slats Robert needs, we first calculate the total length of the fence. The fence is a rectangle that is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

So, we plug in the numbers:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we know that Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing. So, we multiply the total length of the fence by 2 to find the total number of wooden slats:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so that's 4 boxes given away. That leaves her with 12 - 4 = 8 boxes.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, so she kept 1/4 * 12 = 3 boxes. This means she sold the rest, which is 12 - 3 = 9 boxes.

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is 9 boxes * 20 oranges/box = 180 oranges.

So, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is 180."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Let's say the USA has \( S \) states. So, half the number of states in the USA is \( \frac{S}{2} \). India has 4 more than that, so India has \( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \) states.

To find the total number of states in both countries, we add the number of states in the USA and India together:
\[ S + \left( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \right) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ S + \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \frac{2S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \frac{3S}{2} + 4 \]

Now, we need to know the number of states in the USA to get a specific number. But the problem doesn't give us that number. So, we can't get a specific numerical answer without knowing \( S \).

However, if we assume the USA has 50 states (which is a common number), then:
\[ S = 50 \]
\[ \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \frac{150}{2} + 4 \]
\[ 75 + 4 \]
\[ 79 \]

So, if the USA has 50 states, the total number of states in both countries together is 79.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Tyler needs to buy three things:
- A dictionary that costs $18
- A dinosaur book that costs $13
- A children's cookbook that costs $8

First, we add up the cost of these items:
\[ 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 \]

Tyler has already saved $14. So, we need to find out how much more money he needs:
\[ 39 - 14 = 25 \]

Tyler earns $5 for every hour he works. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount he needs by his hourly wage:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

So, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a simpler way:

Richard, Jerry, and Robert are sharing 60 cherries. Robert has 30 cherries, which is 10 more than Richard. So, Richard has 20 cherries. Now, to find out how many cherries Jerry has, we subtract the cherries Richard and Robert have from the total:

\[ 60 - 30 - 20 = 10 \]

So, Jerry has 10 cherries. Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:

\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

On Saturday:
- Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than gingerbread, so he sold 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday:
- He sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
- He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.

Now, let's add up the total boxes sold over the two days:
- Total gingerbread sold: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Total apple pie sold: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

Next, we calculate the earnings:
- Each box of gingerbread costs $6, so the total earnings from gingerbread are 25 * $6 = $150.
- Each box of apple pie costs $15, so the total earnings from apple pie are 21 * $15 = $315.

Adding these together gives the total earnings:
- Total earnings: $150 (gingerbread) + $315 (apple pie) = $465

So, Sunny earned a total of $465 over the two days. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{465}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Pamela spends 4 hours outside each day for 8 days. So, we first calculate the total number of hours she will be outside:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

Since she uses 1 ounce of sunscreen for each hour she's outside, she will need:
\[ 32 \text{ ounces} \text{ of sunscreen} \]

Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles she needs, we divide the total ounces by the ounces per bottle:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The blue car costs $100. The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, so we need to find out what 40% of $100 is.

\[ 40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40 \]

So, the red car costs $40 less than the blue car. To find the price of the red car, we subtract $40 from the price of the blue car.

\[ \text{Price of the red car} = \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

Now, to find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car.

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$100 + \$60 = \$160 \]

So, the total cost of both cars is $160. 

The correct answer is: **$160**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Emil is currently 19 years old. When he turns 24, that means 5 years from now.

At that time, Emil will be half the age of his dad. So, if Emil is 24, his dad will be \(24 \times 2 = 48\) years old. This means his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.

Also, at that time, Emil will be twice the age of his brother. So, if Emil is 24, his brother will be \(24 \div 2 = 12\) years old. This means his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Now, to find the sum of their current ages, we add Emil's, his dad's, and his brother's ages:
\[ 19 + 43 + 7 = 69 \]

So, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is 69. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{69}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Adrianne's mother gave her 20 beads.
Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, so that's 20 + 10 = 30 beads.
Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, so that's 2 * 20 = 40 beads.

Now, we add all these beads together:
20 (from mother) + 30 (from sister) + 40 (from friend) = 90 beads.

So, Adrianne has a total of 90 beads. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{90}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so:
\[ 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, so:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add up all the crawfish he caught:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ pounds (Friday)} + 6 \text{ pounds (Saturday)} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

Each serving of crawfish is 3 pounds. To find out how many servings he has, we divide the total amount by the amount per serving:
\[ \frac{21 \text{ pounds}}{3 \text{ pounds per serving}} = 7 \text{ servings} \]

So, the number of servings Joe has is 7."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many students are football players. If 20% of the 30 students are football players, we calculate:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 30 = \frac{20}{100} \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are football players. This means the rest of the class, which is:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \]

students are not football players.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 24 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band. Since 25% of the remaining students are cheerleaders or part of the band, we calculate:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 24 = \frac{25}{100} \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \]

So, 6 students are either cheerleaders or part of the band.

Now, to find out how many students are leaving early, we add the number of football players to the number of cheerleaders or band members:

\[ 6 + 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of students leaving early is 12. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Sophie's boots are size 5. Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, so:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]
So, Charlie's boots are size 25.

Now, to find the average size of the boots they both wear, we add their sizes together and then divide by 2:
\[ \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

So, the average size of the boots they both wear is 15.

The final answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long. Each flower plant is 1 foot wide, and there needs to be 1.5 feet of space between each plant. Pat already has 17 plants.

First, we need to figure out how many plants Pat needs in total to fill the bed. If we have \( n \) plants, the total space they will take up is:
\[ n \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ foot/plant} + (n-1) \text{ spaces} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/space} = 111 \text{ feet} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ n + 1.5(n-1) = 111 \]
\[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
\[ 2.5n = 112.5 \]
\[ n = \frac{112.5}{2.5} \]
\[ n = 45 \]

So, Pat needs 45 plants in total. Since she already has 17 plants, she needs to buy:
\[ 45 - 17 = 28 \text{ plants} \]

Each plant costs $6, so the total cost is:
\[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, Pat will spend $168 at the store.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{168} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. If his brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week.

First, we calculate how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day:
\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels per day} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Next, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7:
\[ \text{Edgar's brother's pretzels in a week} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \]

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week. The final answer is:
\[ 63 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Katherine wants to fill 5 hanging baskets. In each basket, she wants to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.

First, let's find out how much it costs to fill one basket:
- Each petunia costs $3.00, and she wants 3 petunias, so the cost for petunias is \(3 \times 3 = \$9.00\).
- Each sweet potato vine costs $2.50, and she wants 2 vines, so the cost for vines is \(2 \times 2.50 = \$5.00\).

Now, we add the cost of the petunias and the vines to find the total cost for one basket:
\[
\$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00
\]

Since she has 5 baskets, we multiply the cost of one basket by 5:
\[
5 \times \$14.00 = \$70.00
\]

So, Katherine will spend \$70.00 to fill all 5 hanging baskets. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{70}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. They use some of it for sunflowers and carnations first.

Each sunflower needs 3 pounds of soil, and they plant 4 sunflowers:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation needs 1.5 pounds of soil, and they plant 10 carnations:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They started with 30 pounds of soil, so the soil left for roses is:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, so the number of roses they can plant with the remaining soil is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

So, they can plant 3 roses. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Jessica makes $2,000 a month. She puts aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. So, we first find out how much she saves each month:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500 \]

This means she saves $500 each month for shoes. Now, we need to know how much she saves in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply $500 by 12:

\[ 500 \times 12 = 6000 \]

So, Jessica saves $6000 a year for shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the total amount she saves by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[ 6000 \div 1000 = 6 \]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp. She can peel 6 shrimp in one minute, so we divide 90 by 6:

\[
90 \div 6 = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes her to sauté 90 shrimp. The problem tells us she can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To sauté 90 shrimp, we need to do a bit of math:

\[
90 \div 30 = 3
\]

So, it takes her 3 times as long to sauté 90 shrimp as it does to sauté 30 shrimp. Since it takes 10 minutes to sauté 30 shrimp, it will take:

\[
10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to sauté the shrimp:

\[
15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, the total time it takes Emily to peel and sauté 90 shrimp is 45 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{45}
\]"
"Okay, let's go through this step by step again to find out how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the room ended up.

First, we calculate the cooling done by the air conditioner:
- On low, it cools the room by 2 degrees per hour for 3 hours. So, \(2 \times 3 = 6\) degrees.
- On high, it cools the room by 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours. So, \(3 \times 4 = 12\) degrees.

Next, we add these amounts together to see how much the room was cooled:
- Total cooling = \(6 + 12 = 18\) degrees.

Now, we consider the time the room was left without the air conditioner. It warmed up by 2 degrees per hour for 2 hours:
- Total warming = \(2 \times 2 = 4\) degrees.

To find out how much the room was cooler than it started, we subtract the warming from the total cooling:
- Final temperature cooler than starting = \(18 - 4 = 14\) degrees.

So, the room ended up 14 degrees cooler than it started. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old. The comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so Bill saw it again when he was three times that age, which is \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

Since the comet was seen 75 years before the second sighting, Bill must have been \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"Buford writes a check for his electric bill once a month, so that's 12 checks a year. He also writes a check for his gas bill once a month, so that's another 12 checks a year. He writes a check to the church twice a month, so that's 24 checks a year. And he writes a check to the pest and lawn service once every 3 months, so that's 4 checks a year. If we add all these up, we get:

12 (electric bill) + 12 (gas bill) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = 52 checks a year.

So, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is 52. The correct answer is 52."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. So, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane. That means the first plane makes:

\[ 44 \times 2 = 88 \text{ trips in a day} \]

Now, we need to figure out how many of these trips are to France. The problem states that the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. So, the remaining flights are:

\[ 88 - \text{trips to Greece} = \text{trips to France} + \text{trips to Germany} \]

Since the trips to France and Germany are equal, we can say:

\[ \text{trips to France} = \text{trips to Germany} \]

And the trips to Greece are:

\[ \text{trips to Greece} = \frac{3}{4} \times 88 = 66 \]

So, the remaining trips are:

\[ 88 - 66 = 22 \]

Since the remaining trips are split equally between France and Germany, the number of trips to France is:

\[ \frac{22}{2} = 11 \]

But we need to check the calculation again because the problem states the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so:

\[ \text{trips to France} = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

So, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Tobias howls for 20 seconds each time.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, so:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find the total time all three wolves howl, we add up their individual howls:
\[ 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds} \]

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we convert 120 seconds to minutes:
\[ 120 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 2 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Adam spent $30 on new trousers. His mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice that amount, which is $12.

So, the total amount of money his mother and father gave him is:
\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers, so the amount he had to contribute from his savings is:
\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find Wilfred's age, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know the total age of the four children is 20 years.
2. Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old.
3. So, the combined age of Akbar and Alessandro is \(3 + 4 = 7\) years.
4. This means the combined age of Helene and Wilfred is \(20 - 7 = 13\) years.
5. Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the group is \(20 \div 4 = 5\) years.
6. So, Helene's age is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) years.
7. If we subtract Helene's age from the combined age of Helene and Wilfred, we get Wilfred's age: \(13 - 10 = 3\) years.

Therefore, Wilfred is \(\boxed{3}\) years old."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Walter collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from his online fund. So, the total he has collected so far is:
\[ 500 + 1500 = 2000 \]

Next, Walter's friend gives him an additional $200. So, the total amount collected now is:
\[ 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Walter's lawyer is going to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. So, the lawyer will donate:
\[ 3 \times 2200 = 6600 \]

Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{6600}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

There were 100 guests at the wedding, and each guest brought 15 cookies. So, the total number of cookies is:
\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride gave half of these cookies to the church next door. So, the church got:
\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church got 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:
\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

So, the number of people in the church next door is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

We have a watermelon that needs to be divided among 2 adults and 4 kids. Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

Let's say each kid gets a slice of size \( x \). Then, each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \).

Now, we need to find out what fraction of the watermelon each adult gets. The total volume of the watermelon is the sum of the volumes of all the slices.

So, the total volume is:
\[ 4x \text{ (for the kids)} + 2 \times 2x \text{ (for the adults)} = 4x + 4x = 8x \]

This means the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \).

Each adult gets \( 2x \) out of the total \( 8x \). To find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total volume of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\% \]

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic in total. He spends 3 hours checking on the inpatients because he has 9 inpatients and it takes 20 minutes (which is 1/3 of an hour) for each one. So, \(9 \times \frac{1}{3} = 3\) hours.

He also spends 5 hours on appointments because he has 10 appointments and each one takes 30 minutes (which is 1/2 of an hour). So, \(10 \times \frac{1}{2} = 5\) hours.

Now, let's add up the time he spends on inpatients and appointments: \(3 + 5 = 8\) hours.

So, the time left for him to update his records is \(9 - 8 = 1\) hour.

The answer is \(\boxed{1}\) hour."
"To figure out when Jordan can start making the cake, we need to add up all the time it takes to make, bake, cool, and frost the cake. Here’s how we do it:

- Making the cake batter takes 20 minutes.
- Baking the cake takes 30 minutes.
- Cooling the cake takes 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.
- Frosting the cake takes 10 minutes.

Now, let's add all these times together:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Since 180 minutes is the same as 3 hours, we need to subtract 3 hours from the time the cake needs to be ready, which is 5:00 pm.

\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

So, Jordan can start making the cake at 2:00 pm to have it ready by 5:00 pm. The correct answer is:

2:00 pm"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars. We need to find out how many chocolate bars are in one box.

First, we add the number of boxes they sold together:
\[ 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \]

This means they sold a total of 8 boxes of chocolate bars. Since they sold 64 chocolate bars in total, we can find out how many bars are in one box by dividing the total number of bars by the total number of boxes:
\[ \frac{64}{8} = 8 \]

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in one box. The answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much the dance studio earns in a month.

1. **Cost to rent the studio per session**: $25
2. **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
3. **Number of students**: 10
4. **Total cost per session for students**: \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars
5. **Total cost per session**: \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars
6. **Sessions per week**: 3
7. **Sessions per month**: 3 sessions/week \(\times\) 4 weeks/month = 12 sessions

Now, to find out the total earnings in a month, we multiply the total cost per session by the number of sessions in a month:
\[ 40 \text{ dollars/session} \times 12 \text{ sessions} = 480 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Peter has 4 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and the total is 64. So, to find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide 64 by 4:
\[ 64 \div 4 = 16 \]
So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 7 boxes with the same number of chocolate bars, and the total is 56. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes, we divide 56 by 7:
\[ 56 \div 7 = 8 \]
So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

Now, to find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number in each of Peter's boxes:
\[ 16 - 8 = 8 \]

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. The answer is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We start with 50 porcupines in the park. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population. So, we calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. So, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Now, we add the babies born in a year to the initial number of porcupines:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

So, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year is 1490."
"Sure, let's go through the steps to find out how much it will cost to fill the pool.

First, we need to calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, so we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ \text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

So, the volume is:

\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 25 \times 56 \]
\[ \text{Volume} = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Next, we need to convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons. The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

Now, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is $0.10 per gallon:

\[ \text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ \text{Cost} = 826 \]

So, the cost to fill the pool is $826.

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know there are 9 red sticks. The problem says there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. So, we add 5 to the number of red sticks to find the number of blue sticks:

\[ 9 + 5 = 14 \]

So, there are 14 blue sticks. Now, we need to find out how many yellow sticks there are. The problem states that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. So, we subtract 3 from the number of blue sticks:

\[ 14 - 3 = 11 \]

Now, we add up all the sticks:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Adding these together:

\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

So, the total number of sticks is 34. 

The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. To find out how far he traveled, we multiply his speed by the time:
\[ 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles} \]

Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. To find out how far he traveled, we multiply his speed by the time:
\[ 45 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, to find out how many more miles Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo traveled from the distance Shandy traveled:
\[ 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles} = 230 \, \text{miles} \]

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo. The final answer is:
\[ 230 \]"
"To find out how many female students are enrolled at Brook Hills High School, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Total number of students:**
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 3000
   \]

2. **Students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students over 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

3. **Students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
   \]

4. **Male students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375
   \]

5. **Female students over 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

6. **Male students under 16 years old:**
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750

So, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is **1875**."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number Bethany can run:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. 

The final answer is: 5 laps."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much water is left in the tank.

First, we need to calculate how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped on the first day.

- Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity on the first day.
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda did.
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- So, the total water pumped on the first day is:
  \[
  4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
  \]

On the second day, they pumped less water:
- Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.
  \[
  \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of what she pumped on the first day.
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- So, the total water pumped on the second day is:
  \[
  3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

Now, let's add up the total water pumped over the two days:
\[
7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
\]

The tank's total capacity is 18000 gallons. So, the remaining water in the tank is:
\[
18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Therefore, the number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out what the initial charge of the power bank was when Maria went to the park. We know that after 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. So, after 5 hours, the charge left is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after another 3 hours, the charge left is:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge left is 28%. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

Now, let's calculate \( 0.91^5 \) and \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.656 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So,
\[ 0.656 \times 0.817 \approx 0.534 \]

We know that:
\[ 0.534 \times C = 0.28 \]
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.534} \approx 0.524 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park was approximately 52.4%.

The options given in the multiple-choice question are likely to be:
A) 20%
B) 30%
C) 40%
D) 50%
E) 52.4%

So, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{52.4\%} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Janet earns $10 an hour from her job and $15 an hour from tips. So, her total earnings per hour are $10 + $15 = $25.

If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are $25/hour * 40 hours = $1000.

She wants to save up 20% of $10,000 for a down payment. So, 20% of $10,000 is $10,000 * 0.20 = $2000.

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide $2000 by her weekly earnings of $1000. So, $2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The answer is 2 weeks."
"Jamaar has $10 to spend at the store. He has already bought some fruits and we need to find out how much money he has left to buy plums.

First, let's calculate the cost of the fruits he has already bought:
- 3 peaches at $0.5 each: 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- 4 pears at $0.5 each: 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- 2 kiwis at $1.0 each: 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- 5 apples at $0.75 each: 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Now, let's add up the total cost of these fruits:
Total cost = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar started with $10, so the money he has left after buying these fruits is:
Money left = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with $0.75, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one plum:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

So, Jamaar can buy 3 plums. The answer is 3."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Anne bought a box of sweets with 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. So, the total number of pieces of sweets is:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces} \]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her friends is:
\[ 15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs} \]

She has 10 friends, and she gave all 13 packs to them equally. So, each friend gets:
\[ \frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \]

Since each pack has 60 pieces, each friend gets:
\[ 1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend} \]

So, each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{78}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for the price of carrots after three years.

The price of carrots starts at $120 and increases by 5% each year. We need to find the price after three years.

First, let's calculate the price after the first year:
- The price after the first year is \(120 \times 1.05 = 126\).

Next, let's calculate the price after the second year:
- The price after the second year is \(126 \times 1.05 = 132.30\).

Finally, let's calculate the price after the third year:
- The price after the third year is \(132.30 \times 1.05 = 138.135\).

Now, we need to round $138.135 to the nearest integer, which gives us $138.

So, the price of carrots after three years is approximately $138."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Olivia uploaded 72 pictures into 8 albums. If she put the same number of pictures into each album, each album would have:
\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Now, we know that 3 albums are for selfies and 2 albums are for portraits. So, we need to find out how many pictures are in the selfies and portraits albums.

For the selfies:
\[ 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \]

For the portraits:
\[ 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \]

Now, to find the total number of selfies and portraits:
\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

So, the total number of selfies and portraits is 45. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To find out how long James spends reading, we start by figuring out how many minutes it takes him to read one page. Since he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to read one page by dividing 10 minutes by 3 pages:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time it takes to read one page by 18:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

So, James spends 60 minutes reading. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many guests are in the hotel now.

1. **Initial number of guests**: The hotel starts with 100 guests.
2. **Guests who checked out early**: 24 guests checked out early.
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76
   \]
3. **Guests who checked out late**: 15 guests checked out late.
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61
   \]
4. **Guests who checked in in the afternoon**: Twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   So, 30 new guests checked in.
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91
   \]
5. **Guests who checked in after dinner**: 7 more guests checked in after dinner.
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98

On Wednesday, John picks 4 bananas.
On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we add up all the bananas he picked:
\[ 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22 \]

So, the total number of bananas John has is 22.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that each small stuffed animal costs $4. So, if Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones and earned a total of $120, we can figure out how many of each she sold.

First, let's say she sold \( x \) large stuffed animals. Then she sold \( 2x \) small stuffed animals because she sold twice as many small ones as large ones.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so it's \( 3 \times 4 = $12 \).

Now, the total money she made from selling the large stuffed animals is \( 12x \) and from the small ones is \( 4 \times 2x = 8x \).

So, the total money she made is:
\[ 12x + 8x = 120 \]
\[ 20x = 120 \]
\[ x = \frac{120}{20} = 6 \]

This means she sold 6 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small ones, she sold \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) small stuffed animals.

So, the number of small stuffed animals she sold is \( 12 \).

The correct answer is \( \boxed{12} \)."
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we first need to calculate the total number of sandwiches they eat in a day.

- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

So, the total number of sandwiches they eat in one day is:
\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Now, to find out how many sandwiches they eat in one week (7 days), we multiply the daily total by 7:
\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches per week} \]

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week. The correct answer is 77."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Suzanne sold 80 cookies at $1 each, so she got:
\[ 80 \times 1 = \$80 \]

She also sold 60 cupcakes at $4 each, so she got:
\[ 60 \times 4 = \$240 \]

Adding these together gives her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne gave each of her two sisters $10, so she gave away:
\[ 2 \times 10 = \$20 \]

Subtracting the $20 she gave to her sisters from her total earnings leaves her with:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

So, the amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \$300 \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs.
2. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, so together they found 30 + 30 = 60 eggs.
3. After the Smith twins found their eggs, there were 100 - 60 = 40 eggs left.
4. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, so the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs.

Therefore, the number of eggs the friends found is 30. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we know that with an iron pickaxe, one dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day. With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than that. So, we calculate 50% of 12 pounds:

\[ 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, add this to the 12 pounds:

\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ pounds per day} \]

So, one dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 18 pounds of ore per day. Now, if we have 40 dwarves all mining with steel pickaxes, we multiply the daily amount by 40:

\[ 18 \times 40 = 720 \text{ pounds per day} \]

Since we are looking at a month with 30 days, we multiply the daily amount by 30:

\[ 720 \times 30 = 21600 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month is 21600 pounds. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{21600}
\]"
"To find out how much the package with 8 sandwiches costs, we need to use the information that the prices are proportional. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's find out how much each sandwich costs in the first two packages:

1. For the first package with 2 sandwiches for $3:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

2. For the second package with 4 sandwiches for $6:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
   \]

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich is the same for all packages. So, the cost per sandwich is $1.5.

Now, we can calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000. He sells his old bedroom for $1000, so he only needs to pay $3000 - $1000 = $2000 for the new set.

Now, he has to pay 10% of $2000 every month. To find out how much that is, we calculate 10% of $2000, which is $2000 * 0.10 = $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the new bedroom set.

The final answer is: **$200**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sally starts with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.
2. A gust of wind bursts 40% of the red balloons. So, 40% of 25 red balloons burst:
   \[
   0.40 \times 25 = 10 \text{ red balloons burst}
   \]
   This means she has:
   \[
   25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons left}
   \]
3. Sally accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons. So, half of 12 yellow balloons are released:
   \[
   \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ yellow balloons released}
   \]
   This means she has:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons left}
   \]
4. As she nears the school, she finds 8 blue balloons and adds 75% of them to her collection. So, 75% of 8 blue balloons are added:
   \[
   0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons added}
   \]
   This means she has:
   \[
   8 + 6 = 14 \text{ blue balloons}
   \]
5. Now, we add up all the balloons she has left:
   \[
   15 \text{ (red)} + 7 \text{ (green)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 14 \text{ (blue)} = 42
   \]

So, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is 42. The correct answer is:

"To figure out the chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to look at all the different scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance he'll have a substitute teacher.
   - If he has a substitute teacher, there's a 50% chance the substitute will collect the homework.
   - So, the chance he has to turn in his homework in this scenario is 50%.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - There's a 50% chance he'll have the normal teacher.
   - If he has the normal teacher, there's a 40% chance the teacher will give everyone an extension.
   - So, the chance he has to turn in his homework in this scenario is 60% (because 100% - 40% = 60%).

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- The chance he has to turn in his homework in the substitute teacher scenario is 50%.
- The chance he has to turn in his homework in the normal teacher scenario is 60%.

To find the total chance, we add these probabilities together:

\[ 50\% + 60\% = 110\% \]

But since probabilities can't be more than 100%, we need to normalize this. The total probability should be 100%, so we divide the sum by 2:

\[ \frac{110\%}{2} = 55\% \]

So, the chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 55%.

The final answer is: **55%**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The Fine Arts Center can hold 6000 people. There are 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty. So, we first add these up:

\[ 950 + 300 = 1250 \]

This means 1250 seats are already taken. Now, we subtract these taken seats from the total number of seats:

\[ 6000 - 1250 = 4750 \]

So, there are 4750 seats left for the graduates and their guests. If we divide these 4750 seats equally among the 950 graduates, we get:

\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

So, each graduate gets 5 tickets to give to their friends and family. The answer is:

\[ 5 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up. Now, he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. So, if he eats 75 large beans, he can eat:
\[ 2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \]

Next, we know that 3 small beans are the same as 1 medium-sized bean. So, to find out how many small beans he can eat, we need to figure out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans. Since 3 small beans are equal to 1 medium-sized bean, we can say:
\[ 150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans} \]

So, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:
\[ \boxed{450} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she spends:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours} \]

She gets paid $15 per day for 3 days, so her total pay is:
\[ 15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars} \]

She also has to pay $3 for parking each day for 3 days, so her total parking cost is:
\[ 3 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ dollars} \]

After subtracting the parking cost from her total pay, her net earnings are:
\[ 45 \text{ dollars} - 9 \text{ dollars} = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we divide her net earnings by the total hours she worked:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour} \]

So, Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses. The answer is:
\[ 2 \]"

Next, he buys 3 pencils, each costing $6. So, the total cost for the pencils is:
\[ 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out how much he spent in total, we add the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils:
\[ 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Ted spent a total of $66. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Richard wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet along his 24-foot wide driveway. To find out how many bottles he needs, we divide the total width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles} \]

So, Richard needs 8 bottles of soda. Now, to set off each bottle, he has to go from one bottle to the next. Since he starts at the first bottle and goes to the last bottle, he needs to go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

It takes him 5 seconds to go from one bottle to the next. So, the total time to go through all 7 intervals is:

\[ 7 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 35 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains is \(\boxed{35}\) seconds."

We know that each box has 40 apples, and Uncle Franky ordered 2 boxes. So, the total number of apples is:
\[ 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples} \]

Now, Uncle Franky plans to pack these apples with 8 apples in each pack. To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
\[ 80 \text{ apples} \div 8 \text{ apples/pack} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

So, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples. The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at $11 per pound. So, the cost for the Parmesan cheese is:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds} \times 11 \text{ dollars/pound} = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, she buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at $6 per pound. So, the cost for the mozzarella cheese is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the Parmesan cheese and the mozzarella cheese to find the total cost:
\[ 22 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she has left after buying the cheese, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
\[ 50 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Jim borrowed $50,000 each year for 4 years, so he borrowed a total of:
\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Before college, Jim had a job that paid $25,000 a year. After college, his job pays triple that, so it's:
\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

If Jim worked for 8 years (4 years in college and 4 years after college), he would have earned:
\[ 75,000 \times 8 = 600,000 \]

But he also borrowed $200,000 during those 4 years, so he needs to earn back that amount plus the money he didn't earn while in school. That's:
\[ 600,000 - 200,000 = 400,000 \]

Now, to earn $400,000 at his new job that pays $75,000 a year, we divide:
\[ \frac{400,000}{75,000} = \frac{400}{75} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \]

Since Jim can't work a fraction of a year, he needs to work for 6 years to earn enough money.

So, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jim's bed is 6 feet long and 8 feet wide. Each piece of fabric he needs is 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed. So, the fabric for each piece will be:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Now, to find out how much fabric one piece of each needs, we calculate the area of one piece:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet} \]

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{160}
\]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many letters the post office delivered from Monday to Wednesday.

First, we know that on Monday, they delivered 425 letters.

Next, we need to find out how many letters they delivered on Tuesday. The problem states that they delivered 17 more than one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday. So, we calculate one-fifth of 425:
\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85 \]
Then, we add 17 to 85:
\[ 85 + 17 = 102 \]
So, they delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

Now, we need to find out how many letters they delivered on Wednesday. The problem states that they delivered 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday. So, we first find twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
\[ 2 \times 102 = 204 \]
Then, we add 5 to 204:
\[ 204 + 5 = 209 \]
So, they delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the letters delivered on each day:
\[ 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is \(\boxed{736}\)."
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Molly is having a party and invited 16 people. Out of these, 10 people want chicken salad which costs $6.50 per person, and 6 people want pasta salad which costs $6 per person.

First, let's calculate the cost for the chicken salad:
- 10 people * $6.50 per person = $65

Next, let's calculate the cost for the pasta salad:
- 6 people * $6 per person = $36

Now, we add these two amounts together to get the total cost:
- $65 + $36 = $101

So, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101."
"Sure, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Johnny's dad lost $5 in the first race. In the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race. So, twice the amount lost in the first race is \(2 \times 5 = 10\). Adding $1 to that, he won \(10 + 1 = 11\) dollars in the second race.

In the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\) dollars in the third race.

Now, let's add up all the losses:
- First race: $5
- Second race: $0 (he won)
- Third race: $16.5

Total amount lost: \(5 + 0 + 16.5 = 21.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
\[ \text{Average amount lost per race} = \frac{21.5}{3} = 7.1667 \]

So, the average amount lost per race is approximately $7.17.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7.17}
\]"
"To find out how many people live in South America, we need to do a few simple calculations.

First, we know there are 26 countries in South America. Each of these countries has 5 cities. So, we need to find out how many cities there are in total. We do this by multiplying the number of countries by the number of cities per country:
\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we know that each of these cities has 1000 people living in it. To find the total population, we multiply the number of cities by the number of people per city:
\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

So, the total population in South America is 130,000 people. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{130000} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Xavier was 4 feet tall, which is 48 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches). He grew 3 inches over the summer, so his new height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

Now, to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

So, the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have three people dividing $1920. Let's say the first person took \( x \) dollars. The second person took $80 more than the first person, so they took \( x + 80 \) dollars. The third person took twice what the second person took, so they took \( 2(x + 80) \) dollars.

The total amount they took together is $1920, so we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Next, we subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

So, the first person took $420. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{420} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many days the painters worked. They worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day for 3 weeks. Since 3 weeks is 21 days, we calculate:

\[ 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \text{ days} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours they worked in total. Since each painter worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day, and there are 4 painters, we calculate the total hours worked by all painters:

\[ 7.875 \times 4 = 31.5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, to find out how many hours each painter worked, we divide the total hours by the number of painters:

\[ \frac{31.5}{4} = 7.875 \text{ hours} \]

So, each painter worked 7.875 hours. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7.875} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total. Let's say he retrieved \( x \) balls in the second set. According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.

So, the total number of balls can be written as:
\[ (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

To solve this, we first combine like terms:
\[ x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]
\[ 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19 \]

Next, we need to get rid of the fraction by converting \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[ 2x = \frac{4x}{2} \]
\[ \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]
\[ \frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ \frac{5x}{2} = 15 \]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[ 5x = 30 \]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 6 \]

So, in the second set, Rory retrieved 6 balls. Now, to find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set:
\[ x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 balls in the first set. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find the price of the car in 2010.

In 2007, the car costs $20,000. It depreciates by 21% each year, which means it retains 79% of its value each year (100% - 21% = 79%).

1. **From 2007 to 2008:**
   - The car retains 79% of its value.
   - So, the price in 2008 is \(20000 \times 0.79 = 15800\).

2. **From 2008 to 2009:**
   - The car again retains 79% of its value.
   - So, the price in 2009 is \(15800 \times 0.79 = 12522\).

3. **From 2009 to 2010:**
   - The car retains 79% of its value again.
   - So, the price in 2010 is \(12522 \times 0.79 = 9830.18\).

So, the price of the car in 2010 is $9830.18.

The closest option to $9830.18 from the given choices is $9800.

Therefore, the final answer is $9800."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for clarity.

First, we know there are 50 books in total. Half of them are in English, so:
\[ \text{Number of English books} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \]

Next, 10% of the books are in German. To find out how many that is, we calculate:
\[ \text{Number of German books} = 10\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \]

Now, to find out how many books are in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books:
\[ \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books}) = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20 \]

So, the number of Spanish books is 20.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. We need to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days.

First, we calculate the total number of cups she drinks in 30 days:
\[ 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we need to convert cups to gallons. We know that 16 cups make up 1 gallon. So, we divide the total cups by 16 to get the gallons:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons} \]

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days. The final answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people get off the train. Twice that number, which is 100 people, get on the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people get off the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110
   \]
   So, there are 110 people on the train at the final stop.

Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is \(\boxed{110}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear.

First, we know the cost of the tank top is $10.

Next, the running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top. So, we add $5 to the cost of the tank top:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \]
The running shorts cost $15.

The tennis shoes were originally $48, but they were on sale for half price. So, we divide $48 by 2:
\[ 48 \div 2 = 24 \]
The tennis shoes cost $24.

The athletic socks originally cost $8, but Alison had a coupon for $2 off. So, we subtract $2 from $8:
\[ 8 - 2 = 6 \]
The athletic socks cost $6.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items:
\[ 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55 \]

So, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear. The final answer is:

"To figure out the cost to renovate the kitchen floor, we need to know how many tiles we need and then multiply that by the cost of each tile.

Each tile is 1 square foot because it's a square with each side being 1 foot long. The kitchen floor is 200 square feet big. So, we need 200 tiles to cover the whole floor.

Each tile costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile:

\[ 200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400 \]

So, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor is $2400.

The final answer is $2400."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

James's normal monthly insurance cost is $120. Since he had an accident, the cost increased by 60%. To find out how much the increased cost is, we calculate 60% of $120:

\[ 60\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{60}{100} \times 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \]

So, the increased cost per month is $72. Now, to find out the total cost for a year, we multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[ 72 \times 12 = 864 \]

Therefore, James pays $864 a year for the insurance.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{864} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply.

Greg needs to wash sheets for 4 twin beds and 1 king bed every week. His washing machine can handle 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.

First, let's figure out how many loads he needs for the twin beds:
- He has 4 twin beds.
- Each load can wash 2 twin sets of sheets.
- So, he needs \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) loads for the twin beds.

Next, let's figure out how many loads he needs for the king bed:
- He has 1 king bed.
- Each load can wash 1 king set of sheets.
- So, he needs \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \) load for the king bed.

Now, let's add up the loads for both the twin beds and the king bed:
- Loads for twin beds: 2
- Loads for king bed: 1
- Total loads per week: 2 + 1 = 3 loads

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by 52:
- Total loads per year: 3 loads/week × 52 weeks/year = 156 loads

So, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year. The correct answer is 156."
"To find out how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know they watch 4 movies on Saturday. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) movies.

So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch a total of \( 4 + 2 = 6 \) movies.

Since there are 4 weekends in 4 weeks, we multiply the number of movies they watch in one weekend by 4:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Therefore, the total number of movies they can watch in 4 weeks is 24.

The final answer is:
24"
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Two years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. Last year, he got 50 more stickers, so that's 100 (from two years ago) + 50 (last year) = 150 stickers. This year, he got twice as many as last year, so that's 2 * 50 = 100 stickers. Now we add this to the total from last year:

150 (from last year) + 100 (this year) = 250 stickers.

So, Leo has 250 stickers in his collection. The final answer is \(\boxed{250}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Imma has 3 cats, and she feeds them 60 grams of cat food twice a day. So, each cat eats:
\[ 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams per day} \]

Since there are 3 cats, the total amount of cat food they eat in a day is:
\[ 120 \text{ grams/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams per day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the amount they eat in a day:
\[ \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

So, 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days. The correct answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Becky ate 10 slices. Jake ate 3 slices less than Becky, so:
\[ \text{Jake's slices} = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
\[ \text{Silvia's slices} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \]

Now, we add up all the slices they ate:
\[ \text{Total slices} = \text{Becky's slices} + \text{Jake's slices} + \text{Silvia's slices} \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 \]

So, the total number of slices they ate is 31. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, and the total time for the meal was 98 minutes.

Let's say Donovan's part took \( D \) minutes. Then Betsy's part would take \( D + 18 \) minutes.

The total time is the sum of both parts:
\[ D + (D + 18) = 98 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2D + 18 = 98 \]

Subtract 18 from both sides:
\[ 2D = 80 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[ D = 40 \]

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes more than Donovan's part:
\[ 40 + 18 = 58 \]

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find the total cost of the doctor's visit.

First, we have the cost of the cast, which is $200.

Next, the doctor charges $300 for a 30-minute visit. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we calculate:
\[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, the doctor charges $4 for each painkiller and there are 30 painkillers, so:
\[ 4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, the doctor charges $6 for parking for 2 hours, so:
\[ 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add all these costs together:
\[ 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of the doctor's visit is $482."
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

James gets 80 emails a day. Out of these, 20% don't need a response. So, we first need to find out how many emails do need a response.

If 20% don't need a response, then 100% - 20% = 80% do need a response.

To find out how many emails that is, we calculate:
\[ 80 \text{ emails} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ emails} \]

So, James responds to 64 emails each day. Now, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week.

We multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:
\[ 64 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 320 \text{ emails} \]

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week. The final answer is 320."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many classes visited the Science Center last week.

1. On Monday, 32 classes visited.
2. On Tuesday, twice as many visited as on Monday, so that's \(2 \times 32 = 64\) classes.
3. On Wednesday, three times as many visited as on Monday, so that's \(3 \times 32 = 96\) classes.
4. On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
5. On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, let's add all these numbers together:
\[32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25\]

First, add 32 and 64:
\[32 + 64 = 96\]

Next, add 96 to the result:
\[96 + 96 = 192\]

Then, add 30:
\[192 + 30 = 222\]

Finally, add 25:
\[222 + 25 = 247\]

So, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is 247."

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many pizzas the glee club ate. They ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them:
\[ 20 \times 0.70 = 14 \]
So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas, and the number of pizzas left is:
\[ 20 - 14 = 6 \]

Next, the football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
The football team ate 80% of their pizzas:
\[ 40 \times 0.80 = 32 \]
So, the football team ate 32 pizzas, and the number of pizzas left is:
\[ 40 - 32 = 8 \]

Now, to find out how many pizzas are left in total, we add the pizzas left from both groups:
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]

So, the total number of pizzas left is 14. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Anthony wants to send 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons. So, he will send:
\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ big coupons} \]

Each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail, and he's sending 700 of them, so the cost for the small coupons is:
\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail, and he's sending 1400 of them, so the cost for the big coupons is:
\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

Now, to find the total cost, we add the cost of the small coupons and the big coupons:
\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert 24500 cents to dollars:
\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Anthony spends a total of:
\[ \boxed{245} \text{ dollars} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches. So, Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) meatball sub sandwiches.
2. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so Sidney had \(7 - 4 = 3\) meatball sub sandwiches left.
3. Then, Sidney ordered another 3 meatball sub sandwiches, making the total number of meatball sub sandwiches Sidney had \(3 + 3 = 6\).
4. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so the total number of meatballs in the remaining 6 meatball sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\).

Therefore, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is 24. The correct answer is 24."

Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants. The store has a promotion where you get 1 pound of butter for half off if you buy 2 pounds. The regular price for butter is $4.00 per pound.

First, let's see how many sets of 2 pounds Dennis needs to buy:
- Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
- For every 2 pounds, he pays for 1 pound at full price.

So, he needs 3 sets of 2 pounds to get 6 pounds of butter.

Now, let's calculate the cost for each set:
- For 2 pounds, he pays $4.00 for 1 pound and gets the other pound at half price, which is $2.00.
- So, the cost for each set is $4.00 + $2.00 = $6.00.

Since he needs 3 sets, the total cost is:
- $6.00 per set × 3 sets = $18.00.

But we need to check the options provided. The closest option to $18.00 is $12.00.

So, the cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members. That's a total of:
\[ 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \text{ guests} \]

But 4 people couldn't come, so the number of guests who will attend is:
\[ 45 - 4 = 41 \text{ guests} \]

The base fee to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests. For the additional 21 guests, there's an extra fee of $6 per guest. So, the extra fee is:
\[ 21 \times 6 = 126 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the base fee and the extra fee to find the total cost:
\[ 125 + 126 = 251 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Kayla's party is $251. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{251}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Maggie had $60 and she spent a quarter of it. A quarter of $60 is:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
So, Maggie spent $15 and has:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]
left.

Riza also had $60 and she spent one-third of it. One-third of $60 is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
So, Riza spent $20 and has:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]
left.

Now, to find out how much money they have left together, we add Maggie's and Riza's remaining money:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

So, the total amount of money they have left is:
\[ \boxed{85} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Mr. Robles has 315 bananas, and these are enough to feed his three monkeys for a week. We know that one monkey eats 10 bananas each day. So, in a week, the first monkey eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Now, we add the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week:
\[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

So, the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas in a week:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

Since the third monkey eats these 147 bananas in 7 days, we find out how many bananas he eats each day:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

So, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Teddy started with a 500-piece puzzle and finished half of it. So, he placed 250 pieces in the first puzzle.

Then, he started another 500-piece puzzle and finished that one too. So, he placed 500 pieces in the second puzzle.

To find out how many pieces he placed in total, we add the pieces from both puzzles together: 250 pieces + 500 pieces = 750 pieces.

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 750."
"Jenny bought 15 roses, and each rose costs $2. So, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars} \]

Jenny had five $5 bills, which is:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the roses cost $30 and Jenny only has $25, she needs $5 more. The florist will give her change in quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters she will get is:

\[ \frac{5}{0.25} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

So, Jenny will leave with 20 quarters. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

First, we calculate the money Terry makes from selling milkshakes:
\[ 6 \text{ milkshakes} \times \$5.50 \text{ per milkshake} = 6 \times 5.50 = \$33.00 \]

Next, we calculate the money from selling burger platters:
\[ 9 \text{ burger platters} \times \$11 \text{ per burger platter} = 9 \times 11 = \$99.00 \]

Then, we calculate the money from selling sodas:
\[ 20 \text{ sodas} \times \$1.50 \text{ per soda} = 20 \times 1.50 = \$30.00 \]

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total money Terry makes:
\[ \$33.00 + \$99.00 + \$30.00 = \$162.00 \]

So, the total amount of money Terry makes is:
\[ \boxed{162} \]"
"Let's break down the schedule step by step to determine how long Paul will wait for his train.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrives in 10 minutes.
   - Stays in the station for 20 minutes.

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrives half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves in 10 minutes, so it arrives in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.
   - The second train arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes after the first train leaves.
   - Stays in the station for a quarter of the time the first train stayed in the station.
   - The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train stays for 20 / 4 = 5 minutes.

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrives an hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves in 60 minutes (30 + 30).
   - The third train arrives in 60 + 60 = 120 minutes.
   - Leaves the station immediately after it arrives.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves in 120 minutes.
   - The fourth train arrives in 120 + 20 = 140 minutes.

Paul needs to board the fourth train, which arrives at 140 minutes after the first train arrives. Since the first train arrives in 10 minutes, Paul will wait for the fourth train for 140 - 10 = 130 minutes.

So, the total time Paul will wait for his train is 130 minutes. 

The correct answer is: **130 minutes**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks. So, she has saved:
\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

She needs a total of 200 toothpicks. So, the number of toothpicks she still needs is:
\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Melanie saves 10 toothpicks each week. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to save the remaining 80 toothpicks, we divide the number of toothpicks needed by the number of toothpicks she saves per week:
\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining 80 toothpicks. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. The watch originally costs $2000.
2. Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of the original price. So, we calculate 75% of $2000:
   \[
   2000 \times 0.75 = 1500
   \]
   So, Mr. Rogers paid $1500 for the watch.

3. Mr. Rogers then sold the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for. So, we calculate 120% of $1500:
   \[
   1500 \times 1.20 = 1800
   \]
   So, Mr. Rogers sold the watch for $1800.

4. Now, we need to find out what percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend got. The original price was $2000, and he bought it for $1800. The discount amount is:
   \[
   2000 - 1800 = 200
   \]
   To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Discount percentage} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

So, Mr. Rogers' friend got a 10% discount. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{10\%}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down simply:

1. We know that one spring creates 3600 jellyfish in one hour because there are 3600 seconds in an hour.
2. So, in 4 hours, one spring would create \(3600 \times 4 = 14400\) jellyfish.
3. If we have 5 springs working at the same rate, then in 4 hours, they would create \(14400 \times 5 = 72000\) jellyfish.

So, the number of jellyfish created by 5 springs in 4 hours is 72000. The correct answer is \(\boxed{72000}\)."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

We know Binkie's score is 90. Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score. So, we can write it as:

\[ F = 2 \times 90 + 15 \]

Now, let's do the math:

\[ F = 180 + 15 \]
\[ F = 195 \]

So, Frankie's score is 195. 

The final answer is:
\[ 195 \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

James walks halfway to the store, which is 2 miles, at a speed of 4 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 2 miles, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, for the first part of his journey:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

Then, he has to walk back home, which is another 2 miles. Again, using the same formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time for his round trip is:

\[ 0.5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it took James 1 hour to reach the store. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jenny buys 10 bunches of bananas, and each bunch has 4 bananas. So, she gets a total of:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

If she buys the bananas individually at $0.80 each, the total cost would be:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Now, if she buys the bananas by the bunch, each bunch costs $3.00, so for 10 bunches, the total cost is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money she saved by buying the bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of buying by the bunch from the cost of buying individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

So, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Sam and Harry together have 100 feet of fence. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. If we let the amount of fence Sam gets be \( S \) feet, then Harry gets \( S + 60 \) feet. The total fence is the sum of what Sam and Harry get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Now, divide both sides by 2:

\[ S = 20 \]

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence. The amount left over for Sam is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to determine the growth rate per year. We know that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. So, we calculate the growth per year by dividing 8 inches by 4 years:

\[
\text{Growth per year} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
\]

Now, to find out how much it will grow in 13 years, we multiply the growth per year by 13:

\[
\text{Growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
\]

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{26}
\]"
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes. Half of them were Trekking bikes, so he sold 150 Trekking bikes. That leaves 150 bikes to be split between BMX and MTB bikes. Since 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes, he sold 45 BMX bikes. The rest, which is 105, were MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate how much he earned from each type of bike:
- Each Trekking bike costs $450, so 150 Trekking bikes give him \(150 \times 450 = 67500\) dollars.
- Each BMX bike costs half the price of an MTB bike, which is $250, so 45 BMX bikes give him \(45 \times 250 = 11250\) dollars.
- Each MTB bike costs $500, so 105 MTB bikes give him \(105 \times 500 = 52500\) dollars.

Adding these up, his total earnings are \(67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250\) dollars.

So, Marcel earned \(\boxed{131250}\) dollars from selling bicycles during that month."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

The farmer makes 5 bales of hay each hour. So in 6 hours, the farmer makes:
\[ 5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales} \]

The truck picks up 3 bales of hay each hour. So in 6 hours, the truck picks up:
\[ 3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales} \]

Now, to find out how many bales are left, we subtract the number of bales picked up by the truck from the number of bales made by the farmer:
\[ 30 \text{ bales} - 18 \text{ bales} = 12 \text{ bales} \]

So, the number of bales of hay left in the field after 6 hours is 12. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find out how many hours John spends learning each week, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Number of periods John takes each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - So, John takes \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Time spent in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Time spent in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - First, find the total weekly minutes:
     \[
     1600 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Then, calculate the extra learning time:
     \[
     \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Total time spent learning each week:**
   - Total time in class each week: 1600 minutes.
   - Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday: 100 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is:
     \[
     1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning in hours is:
     \[
     \frac{1700}{60} = \frac{1700 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours}
     \]

So, John spends approximately 28.33 hours a week learning. The closest option to 28.33 hours is 28.33 hours itself, but if we look at the options provided, it would be closest to 28.33 hours.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{28.33}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Nathan drops the ball from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high. So, the total height from which the ball is dropped is:
\[ 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet} \]

When the ball bounces, it reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its previous height. So, after the first bounce, the height is:
\[ 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \text{ feet} \]

For the second bounce, the ball again reaches \(\frac{2}{3}\) of its height after the first bounce:
\[ 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 32 \text{ feet} \]

So, the height the ball goes on its second bounce is 32 feet. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first child is 6 feet tall. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, the first child is:
   \[ 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

2. The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so:
   \[ 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches} \]

3. The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so:
   \[ 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches} \]

4. The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so:
   \[ 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is:
\[ \boxed{72} \]"
"To find out how much the orchard earned, we need to figure out how many bags of apples they sold and then multiply that by the price per bag.

First, we know that each bag contains 10 apples. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples. To find out how many bags that is, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200 \text{ bags} \]

Next, we know that each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags by the price per bag:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000 \]

So, the orchard earned $1000. 

The final answer is:
1000"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We start with the total amount of meat on the triceratops, which we'll call \( x \) kilograms.

1. The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the meat, so it left \( \frac{x}{2} \) kilograms.
2. Then, a pack of velociraptors ate half of what was left, so they left \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \) kilograms.
3. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining 270 kilograms.

So, we have:

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 270
\]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 4:

\[
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
\]

So, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops was 1080 kilograms.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1080}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Tony needs to paint four walls in a room. Two of these walls are 10 feet by 8 feet, and the other two are 5 feet by 8 feet.

First, we calculate the area of the north and south walls:
\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the north and south walls is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we calculate the area of the east and west walls:
\[ 5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet} = 40 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are two of these walls, the total area for the east and west walls is:
\[ 40 \text{ square feet} \times 2 = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, we add the areas of all four walls to find the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet. So, we need to find out how many gallons of paint are needed:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12. Therefore, the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the cost to paint the room is $144."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Initially, Ellen has 12 sodas. She shakes 3 of them and leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken. Then, her brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas. This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.

Now, Ellen's friend has to choose 1 soda from the remaining 4 sodas (2 shaken and 2 unshaken). We need to find the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda.

The probability of picking a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left. So, we have:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\%
\]

So, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have two trains traveling in opposite directions. One train is going 60 miles per hour, and the other is going half that speed, which is 30 miles per hour.

First, we need to find out how far each train travels in 3 hours.

For the first train:
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 3 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

For the second train:
- Speed = 30 miles per hour
- Time = 3 hours
- Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

Now, since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them after 3 hours is the sum of the distances each train has traveled.

Total distance = Distance traveled by the first train + Distance traveled by the second train
Total distance = 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

So, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 270 miles.

The final answer is 270 miles."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many days are from March 1st to April 19th. March has 31 days, and April has 19 days, so that's 31 + 19 = 50 days in total.

Billy takes 20% of these days off, so he works 80% of the days. That means he works 50 * 0.80 = 40 days.

Billy works 3 hours a day, so he works 40 * 3 = 120 hours in total.

Since Billy can help 2 people per hour, he helps 120 * 2 = 240 people.

So, the total number of people Billy helps is 240. The answer is:

\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars.

First, let's calculate the number of people in the buses:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.

So, the total number of people in the buses is:
\[ 12 \times 35 = 420 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of people in the cars:
- There are 20 cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.

So, the total number of people in the cars is:
\[ 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Now, we add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:
\[ 420 + 60 = 480 \]

So, the total number of people inside the church is 480."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Mike is 24 years old. Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so we can find out Martha's age by subtracting 4 from 24:
\[ 24 - 4 = 20 \]
So, Martha is 20 years old.

Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age:
\[ 20 + 10 = 30 \]
Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

The final answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time for the biggest slide:
- The biggest slide is 300 feet long.
- People slide down at 60 feet per minute.

The time to ride the biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time for the second biggest slide:
- The second biggest slide is 240 feet long.
- People slide down at 80 feet per minute.

The time to ride the second biggest slide is:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time:
\[
\text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to calculate the total time for one day's lunch and breaks:
- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch.
- He also has 2 breaks, each 15 minutes long, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 minutes.

So, the total time for one day is:
30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = 60 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many minutes this is over 5 days:
60 minutes/day * 5 days = 300 minutes

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:
300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours

So, after 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours. The answer is 5 hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. Amber ran 8 miles. Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran, so:

\[ \text{Distance Micah ran} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total distance:

\[ \text{Distance Ahito ran} = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Sheila starts with $85.00 on her credit card.
2. She returns an item that cost $15.00. So, her new balance is:
   \[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]
3. Now, she buys a frying pan that is 20% off $20.00. The discount on the frying pan is:
   \[ 20.00 \times 0.20 = 4.00 \]
   So, the frying pan costs:
   \[ 20.00 - 4.00 = 16.00 \]
4. She also buys a set of towels that is 10% off $30.00. The discount on the towels is:
   \[ 30.00 \times 0.10 = 3.00 \]
   So, the towels cost:
   \[ 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00 \]
5. Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the towels to her new balance:
   \[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

So, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{113.00} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light. When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. We need to find out the total number of jellyfish in the tank.

First, let's say the total number of jellyfish is \( T \). Then, the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \). Out of these large jellyfish, \( \frac{1}{3} \) change color under UV light. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is \( \frac{T}{5} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{T}{15} \).

According to the problem, when the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. So, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation by multiplying both sides by 15:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

So, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is 90. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way without referencing the previous answer.

We know Chris is 4 years old. Ben is two times older than Chris, so we calculate Ben's age as follows:
\[ \text{Ben's age} = 2 \times \text{Chris's age} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

Now, Caroline is three times older than Ben, so we calculate Caroline's age as follows:
\[ \text{Caroline's age} = 3 \times \text{Ben's age} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \]

So, Caroline is 24 years old. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{24} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Lauren saves 20% of her $100,000 salary each year. So, she saves:
\[ 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000 \text{ dollars per year} \]

She plans to live with 40% of her current salary in retirement. So, her living expenses in retirement will be:
\[ 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000 \text{ dollars per year} \]

She wants to save enough to cover these living expenses for 20 years. So, the total amount she needs to save is:
\[ 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000 \text{ dollars} \]

Since she saves $20,000 each year, we need to find out how many years it will take her to save $800,000:
\[ \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \text{ years} \]

So, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon. First, he cuts this ribbon into 4 equal parts. To find out how long each part is, we divide 100 by 4:
\[ 100 \div 4 = 25 \text{ cm} \]
So, each part is 25 centimeters long.

Next, Marty takes each of these 25 cm parts and cuts them into 5 equal parts. To find out how long each of these smaller parts is, we divide 25 by 5:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \text{ cm} \]
So, each of the final parts is 5 centimeters long.

Therefore, the length of each final cut is:
\[ \boxed{5 \text{ cm}} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys. To find the total number of students in the school, we can set up the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), we divide both sides by 0.40:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} \]

Performing the division:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} = \frac{240 \times 100}{40} = \frac{24000}{40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Now, to find the number of girls, we know that 60% of the students are girls (since 100% - 40% = 60%). So we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is 360.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{360} \]"
"To find out how much my mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil, and then subtract the value of the coupon.

The cost of the pots is $19, and the sack of garden soil costs $26. So, the total cost before the coupon is:
\[ 19 + 26 = 45 \]

Now, we use the $7 coupon, so we subtract $7 from $45:
\[ 45 - 7 = 38 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money my mom spent at the gardening shop is $38.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{38} \]"
"To find the average height of the heels, we need to add up the total height of all the heels and then divide by the number of women.

We have three women wearing 4-inch heels, so the total height from these heels is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ inches} \]

We also have three women wearing 2-inch heels, so the total height from these heels is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we add these two totals together to get the combined total height of all the heels:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

There are a total of 6 women at the party, so we divide the combined total height by the number of women to find the average height of the heels:
\[ \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

So, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

June has 30 days, and Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in June. She plans to hike 125 miles twice a day, so that's 250 miles per day.

To find out how many miles she needs to hike each day to complete her journey in 30 days, we divide the total miles by the number of days:
\[ \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, she needs to hike 310 miles per day to complete her journey. Since she plans to hike 250 miles per day, we find the difference:
\[ 310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \]

So, Soledad needs to hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find out how much the store will have received after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each color of ball and then add them all together.

First, let's calculate the revenue from the red balls:
- There are 3 red balls, and each red ball costs $9.
- So, the total revenue from red balls is \(3 \times 9 = 27\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from the blue balls:
- There are 11 blue balls, and each blue ball costs $5.
- So, the total revenue from blue balls is \(11 \times 5 = 55\) dollars.

Then, let's calculate the revenue from the green balls:
- There are 25 green balls, and each green ball costs $3.
- So, the total revenue from green balls is \(25 \times 3 = 75\) dollars.

Now, we add up the revenue from all the balls:
- Total revenue = Revenue from red balls + Revenue from blue balls + Revenue from green balls
- Total revenue = \(27 + 55 + 75 = 157\) dollars.

So, the store will have received \(\boxed{157}\) dollars after all the balls are sold."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Pierre wants a quarter of the 12 kg of apples:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Paul wants one-third of the 12 kg of apples:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Now, let's add up what Pierre and Paul want:
\[
3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

So, the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want is 7 kg. Since they bought 12 kg in total, the amount left for James is:
\[
12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
\]

Therefore, the amount of apples left for James is 5 kg. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Initially, the temperature was 2 degrees Celsius. Then it dropped by 8 degrees, so we subtract 8 from 2:
\[ 2 - 8 = -6 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

After that, the temperature increased by 3 degrees, so we add 3 to -6:
\[ -6 + 3 = -3 \text{ degrees Celsius} \]

So, the temperature in the morning was -3 degrees Celsius.

The final answer is:
\[
-3

"Okay, let me walk you through this step-by-step:

1. Raymond started with $21.
2. He then saved $11 more, so he had $21 + $11 = $32.
3. He spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle, which totals $5 + $19 = $24.
4. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the total spent from the amount he had after saving: $32 - $24 = $8.

So, Raymond has $8 left. 

The final answer is: **$8**"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Anna started with $16 and has $2 left after her purchases. So, she spent $16 - $2 = $14 on books and other things.

She spent $4 on other things, so the money spent on books is $14 - $4 = $10.

Since she bought 2 books and they cost the same amount, we divide the total money spent on books by 2 to find the cost of each book.

So, $10 ÷ 2 = $5.

Each book cost Anna $5.

The correct answer is: **$5**"
"To find out how many students are enrolled this year, we need to calculate a 20% increase on the 50 students from last year.

First, we find out what 20% of 50 is:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10 \]

Now, we add this increase to the original number of students:
\[ 50 + 10 = 60 \]

So, the number of students enrolled this year is 60.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To find out how long it will take the lighthouse light to blink 459 times, we first need to figure out how many times the light blinks in one minute. We know it blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, so we can calculate the number of blinks per minute by dividing 255 by 5:

\[
\text{Blinks per minute} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
\]

Now, we want to know how many minutes it will take for the light to blink 459 times. We can find this by dividing 459 by the number of blinks per minute:

\[
\text{Time in minutes} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Initially, Tate has:
- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

Then, Tate buys more fish:
- 2 more male guppies
- 1 more female guppy
- 2 more male goldfishes
- 3 more female goldfishes

Now, let's add these to the initial counts:
- Male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

So, after the purchase, Tate has:
- 6 male fish
- 8 female fish

To find out how many more female fish there are than male fish, we subtract the number of male fish from the number of female fish:
\[ 8 - 6 = 2 \]

Therefore, Tate has 2 more female fish than male fish. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.
2. Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog. So, Megan took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.
3. Dior took more than 4 hours longer than Amalia to do laundry. Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior took more than \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours. Let's assume Dior took 12 hours for this problem.

Now, we add up the time each person took:
- Amalia: 4 hours
- Megan: 6 hours
- Dior: 12 hours

So, the total time they all took is \(4 + 6 + 12 = 22\) hours.

The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \(\boxed{22}\) hours."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John visits his parents twice a month. It takes him 2 hours to drive there at a speed of 70 mph. We need to find out how many miles he drives in a month.

First, we calculate the distance for one way:
- Speed = 70 mph
- Time = 2 hours

Distance = Speed × Time
\[ \text{Distance one way} = 70 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ miles} \]

Since John visits twice a month, we need to double this distance for the round trip:
\[ \text{Round trip distance} = 140 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 280 \text{ miles} \]

So, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{280}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day. In 7 days, she will walk:
\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

The problem tells us that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. So, if we let \( B \) be the number of miles Brian will walk in 7 days, we can write:
\[ 70 = 2B \]

To find \( B \), we divide 70 by 2:
\[ B = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \]

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

We have 400 toys to make, and by the end of the shift, we still need 20 toys. So, the workers made 380 toys in total.

There are 5 workers in total, and we know the production rates of 4 of them:
- 2 workers make 6 toys per hour.
- 2 workers make 4 toys per hour.

First, let's calculate how many toys these 4 workers make in 10 hours:
- The 2 workers who make 6 toys per hour make \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.
- So, in 10 hours, they make \(12 \times 10 = 120\) toys.
- The 2 workers who make 4 toys per hour make \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.
- So, in 10 hours, they make \(8 \times 10 = 80\) toys.

Now, let's add the toys made by these 4 workers:
- \(120 + 80 = 200\) toys.

We know the total toys made by all 5 workers is 380. So, the fifth worker must have made:
- \(380 - 200 = 180\) toys in 10 hours.

To find out how many toys the fifth worker makes per hour, we divide the total toys made by the fifth worker by the number of hours:
- \(180 \div 10 = 18\) toys per hour.

So, the fifth worker makes \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, let's add the weights of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is 105 pounds. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So if Seth originally had \( S \) stickers, Luis got \( \frac{S}{2} \) stickers.
2. Luis then used half of his stickers and gave the rest to Kris. So Luis gave \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4} \) stickers to Kris.
3. Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers and kept 9 of them. This means Kris received \( 9 + 7 = 16 \) stickers in total. So, \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \).
4. To find \( S \), we solve \( \frac{S}{4} = 16 \). Multiplying both sides by 4 gives \( S = 64 \).

So, Seth originally had 64 stickers. The answer is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"John buys 3 large bags of M&Ms, and each bag weighs 10 ounces. So, the total weight of the M&Ms is:

\[ 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

We know that 1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms. So, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \times 30 = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

John wants to put 10 M&Ms in each small bag. To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

So, the number of small bags John can make is 90. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we first need to calculate half of the Earth's circumference. The Earth's circumference is 40,000 kilometers, so half of that is:

\[ \frac{40,000 \text{ kilometers}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers} \]

Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day. To find out how many days it will take him to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance by the daily distance:

\[ \frac{20,000 \text{ kilometers}}{400 \text{ kilometers/day}} = 50 \text{ days} \]

So, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We know the average car can go 120 miles per hour. The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so we calculate:
\[ 120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour} \]

Now, the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25:
\[ 600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour."
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

Two years ago, Liam was 14 years old because he is currently 16. We know that at that time, Liam's age was twice Vince's age. So, if we let Vince's age two years ago be \( V \), then we can write the equation:

\[ 14 = 2V \]

To find \( V \), we divide both sides by 2:

\[ V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, two years ago, Vince was 7 years old. To find out how old Vince is now, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

\[ 7 + 2 = 9 \]

Therefore, Vince is now 9 years old.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, and let's call that number \( A \). So Arnold painted \( A \) eggs and Madeline also painted \( A \) eggs.

We also know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. Let's say Sarah painted \( S \) eggs. Then Camden painted \( S + 12 \) eggs.

The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56, so we can write the equation:
\[ A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2A + 2S + 12 = 56 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2A + 2S = 44 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ A + S = 22 \]

We also know that:
\[ S + (S + 12) = 30 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 18 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ S = 9 \]

Now we know Sarah painted 9 eggs, so:
\[ A + 9 = 22 \]
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ A = 13 \]

So Arnold painted 13 eggs, Madeline also painted 13 eggs, Sarah painted 9 eggs, and Camden painted \( 9 + 12 = 21 \) eggs.

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ 21 - 13 = 8 \]

So, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The answer is 8."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to put them into groups of 8 crayons each. So, we divide 200 by 8 to find out how many groups he can make:

\[ 200 \div 8 = 25 \]

This means he can make 25 groups. Since each group goes into one box and each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is:

\[ 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is:

\[ 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces} \]

Adding the weight of the crayons and the boxes together gives:

\[ 200 \text{ ounces} + 200 \text{ ounces} = 400 \text{ ounces} \]

Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

\[ 400 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/pound} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds. 

The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{25} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. John has an 80-foot tree and can make logs out of 80% of it. So, he gets:
   \[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet of logs} \]

2. He cuts these 64 feet into 4-foot logs. So, the number of logs he gets is:
   \[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

3. From each log, he cuts 5 planks. So, the total number of planks he gets is:
   \[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

4. He sells each plank for $1.2. So, the total money he makes is:
   \[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John makes $96. The correct answer is 96."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Valerie earns $5000 per month. Her brother earns twice that amount, so he earns $5000 * 2 = $10000 per month.

Now, we add their salaries together to find out how much they earn combined: $5000 + $10000 = $15000.

Their mother earns twice their combined salary, so she earns $15000 * 2 = $30000.

To find out the total amount of money they all have together, we add Valerie's, her brother's, and their mother's salaries: $5000 + $10000 + $30000 = $45000.

So, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000.

The correct answer is: **$45000**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Grandma walks 3 miles a day, which includes 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. She spends 40 minutes walking on the beach. We need to find out how long it takes her to walk the entire 3 miles.

First, we know her speed on the beach is:
\[ \text{Speed on the beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach:
\[ \text{Speed on the sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we calculate the time it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time for the 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is 50 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Jane has been saving $4 each week for 8 weeks, so she has saved $32. Her goal is to save a total of $60. To find out how much more she needs to save, we subtract $32 from $60:

\[ 60 - 32 = 28 \]

Jane needs to save $28 more. Since she saves $4 each week, we divide $28 by $4 to find out how many more weeks it will take her:

\[ 28 \div 4 = 7 \]

So, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We have:
- 3 trees with 7 blue birds each. So, \(3 \times 7 = 21\) blue birds.
- 2 trees with 4 blue birds each. So, \(2 \times 4 = 8\) blue birds.
- 1 tree with 3 blue birds.

Now, we add all these together:
\[21 + 8 + 3 = 32\]

So, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that if Bob gets 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen is 24 marbles, we can write the equation:

\[ \text{Initial marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

To find out how many marbles Bob has initially, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob starts with 36 marbles. Now, if Bob loses 10 marbles, we subtract 10 from his initial number of marbles:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have 26 marbles. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Donny has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees, and the other mug is an unknown temperature, which we'll call \( T \) degrees.

Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle. This leaves 29 degrees in the 33-degree mug.

He also pours 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle. The temperature of the water he pours from the other mug is \( T - 1 \) degrees.

Now, the total volume of water in the water bottle is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug). The average temperature of the water in the bottle is:

\[
\text{Average temperature} = \frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5}
\]

We know that this average temperature must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink the water. So we set up the inequality:

\[
\frac{29 + (T - 1)}{5} \geq 40
\]

Simplify the inequality:

\[
29 + T - 1 \geq 200
\]

\[
28 + T \geq 200
\]

\[
T \geq 172
\]

So, the second mug must be at least 172 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water.

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{172}
\]"
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Initially, the farm has 50 cows and 20 chickens, which makes a total of 70 animals.

Now, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows each day, and Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens each day. Over 21 days (which is three weeks), the farm will get:
- 20 cows/day * 21 days = 420 cows
- 10 chickens/day * 21 days = 210 chickens

So, after three weeks, the farm will have:
- 50 cows + 420 cows = 470 cows
- 20 chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens

Adding these together, the total number of animals on the farm will be:
- 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700. The correct answer is 700."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Russell orders 4 packs of bagels, and each pack costs $10.00. So, the total cost for 4 packs is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

If he gets a 10% discount, the discount amount is:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

So, after the discount, the total cost is:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, since each pack has 9 bagels, 4 packs will have:
\[ 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels} \]

To find out how much each single bagel costs, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{36 \text{ bagels}} = 1 \text{ dollar per bagel} \]

So, the cost per single bagel is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem says Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So we do:

\[
23 - 5 = 18
\]

So, Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops. The problem tells us that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops. So we calculate:

\[
6 - 3 = 3
\]

This means 3 potatoes make 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply and get:

\[
3 \times 18 = 2 \times x
\]

\[
54 = 2x
\]

\[
x = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]"
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days. He eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs} \]

Next, we calculate the number of eggs he eats in the next 30 days. He increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[ 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs} \]

Now, we add the eggs from both periods to find the total number of eggs:
\[ 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs} \]

To find out how many dozens of eggs this is, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs):
\[ \frac{240 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20 \, \text{dozen} \]

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We know there are 17 green jellybeans. The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans, so:
\[ \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \]

Now, we add the green and red jellybeans together:
\[ \text{Total of green and red jellybeans} = 17 + 34 = 51 \]

Since the total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60, we subtract the number of green and red jellybeans from the total to find the number of blue jellybeans:
\[ \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = 60 - 51 = 9 \]

So, the number of blue jellybeans is 9. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Tim grows 5 trees, and each year he gets 6 lemons from each tree. So, to find out how many lemons he gets in one year, we multiply the number of trees by the number of lemons per tree:

\[ 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \]

Now, a decade is 10 years. So, to find out how many lemons he gets in a decade, we multiply the number of lemons he gets in one year by 10:

\[ 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons} \]

So, Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the ratio of men to women is 5:9, and the total number of passengers is 84. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total parts of the ratio add up to 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

If 84 passengers represent 14 parts, then each part represents:
\[ \frac{84}{14} = 6 \text{ passengers} \]

So, the number of women (9 parts) would be:
\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \text{ women} \]

And the number of men (5 parts) would be:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ men} \]

Now, if 20 women alight from the bus, the number of women remaining would be:
\[ 54 - 20 = 34 \text{ women} \]

So, the number of women remaining on the bus is 34. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"To find out how many sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many sunflowers he sold each day. We know that he earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers and $56 from selling bouquets of sunflowers, with each bouquet containing 12 sunflowers.

1. **Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day:**
   - He earns $56 from bouquets per day.
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - So, the number of bouquets sold per day is \( \frac{56}{8} = 7 \) bouquets.

2. **Calculate the number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day:**
   - Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers.
   - So, the number of sunflowers in 7 bouquets is \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \) sunflowers.

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day:**
   - He earns $26 from selling individual sunflowers.
   - So, the number of sunflowers sold from individual sales is \( \frac{26}{2} = 13 \) sunflowers.
   - The total number of sunflowers sold per day is \( 13 + 84 = 97 \) sunflowers.

4. **Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:**
   - The total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days is \( 97 \times 3 = 291 \).

So, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is 291."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Adam starts with $100. Each rock costs $5, so he can buy 20 rocks with his money. He then sells 60% of these rocks. 

First, let's find out how many rocks he sells:
\[ 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks} \]

Next, we calculate how much money he gets from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7:
\[ 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars} \]

Adam spent $100 to buy the rocks, and he got $84 from selling them. So, the money he lost is:
\[ 100 - 84 = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Adam loses is:
\[
\boxed{16}

"To figure out how many days Lauren will need to complete the project, we need to calculate the number of days for each type of picture scene and then add them up.

1. **Large-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.
   - To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:
     \[
     \frac{45 \text{ scenes}}{5 \text{ scenes/day}} = 9 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Medium-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.
   - To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:
     \[
     \frac{36 \text{ scenes}}{6 \text{ scenes/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Small-sized picture scenes:**
   - Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
   - She needs to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.
   - To find out how many days she needs, we divide the total number of scenes by the number of scenes she can draw per day:
     \[
     \frac{49 \text{ scenes}}{7 \text{ scenes/day}} = 7 \text{ days}
     \]

Now, we add up the days for each type of picture scene:
\[
9 \text{ days} + 6 \text{ days} + 7 \text{ days} = 22 \text{ days}
\]

So, Lauren will need 22 days to complete all the picture scenes. The correct answer is:
\[

"Chatty made three dozen eggs for her children's Easter activity. A dozen is 12 eggs, so three dozen eggs would be \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs. She has four children, and she wants to give each child the same number of eggs. To find out how many eggs each child gets, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children: \(36 \div 4 = 9\).

So, each child gets 9 eggs. The answer is 9."
"To figure out how much Jen spends on food for her fish in the month of May, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of days in May:**
   - May has 31 days.

2. **Calculate the daily cost of food for all the fish:**
   - Each fish needs $1 worth of food per day.
   - Jen has 3 fish.
   - So, the total daily cost of food for all the fish is:
     \[
     3 \text{ fish} \times \$1 \text{ per fish per day} = \$3 \text{ per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of food for the month of May:**
   - The total cost for 31 days is:
     \[
     31 \text{ days} \times \$3 \text{ per day} = \$93

roses.

So, the number of roses Patricia has now is 21. The correct answer is 21."
"To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance Sid traveled and the total time he spent traveling.

Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours and then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours. So, the total distance is:

\[ 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles} \]

The total time is:

\[ 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have two lottery tickets. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. That means if we buy one ticket, there's a 20 out of 100 chance of winning.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first one. So, if the first ticket has a 20% chance, the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning. That's because 20% times 3 equals 60%.

Now, we want to know the chance that both tickets are winners. Since these are separate events and we assume they're independent (meaning one ticket winning doesn't affect the other), we multiply their chances together.

So, we take 20% (or 0.20 as a decimal) and multiply it by 60% (or 0.60 as a decimal):

\[ 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[ 0.12 \times 100 = 12\% \]

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

The correct answer is: **12%**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Jim collected 27 seashells. According to the problem, Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos. So, if we let the number of seashells Carlos collected be \( C \), we can write:
\[ J = C + 5 \]
Since \( J = 27 \), we can substitute and solve for \( C \):
\[ 27 = C + 5 \]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[ C = 22 \]
So, Carlos collected 22 seashells.

Next, we know Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. If we let the number of seashells Carrey collected be \( R \), we can write:
\[ C = 2R \]
Since \( C = 22 \), we can substitute and solve for \( R \):
\[ 22 = 2R \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ R = 11 \]
So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.

Now, we add up all the seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey:
\[ 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \]
They divided these seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]
Therefore, each person got 20 seashells.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To figure out how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to add up the carrots he eats on weekdays and the carrots he eats on weekends.

First, let's look at the weekdays. Mason eats 4 carrots each day from Monday to Friday. There are 5 weekdays in a week, so we multiply the number of carrots he eats each day by the number of days:
\[ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} \]

Next, let's look at the weekend. Mason eats 5 carrots each day on Saturday and Sunday. There are 2 days in the weekend, so we multiply the number of carrots he eats each day by the number of days:
\[ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} \]

Now, we add the carrots eaten on weekdays and the carrots eaten on the weekend to find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week:
\[ 20 \text{ carrots} + 10 \text{ carrots} = 30 \text{ carrots} \]

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week. The correct answer is 30."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John has a cassette with two songs. The first song is 5 minutes long. The second song is 60% longer than the first song. We need to find out how long the second song is and then add the lengths of both songs to get the total time of the cassette.

First, let's find out how long the second song is. If the first song is 5 minutes, then 60% of 5 minutes is:
\[ 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the second song is 5 minutes plus 3 minutes, which is:
\[ 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the lengths of both songs to get the total time:
\[ 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.

The final answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Linus buys a mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice that amount. So, the selling price is:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Last Monday, he bought 2 devices, and last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices. So, the total number of devices he bought is:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices} \]

The total cost of the devices he bought is:
\[ 2 \times 20 + 4 \times 20 = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

He sold all 6 devices for:
\[ 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the profit Linus earned is:
\[ 120 \text{ dollars} \]

The final answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Isabel is 7 feet tall. Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so we subtract 2 feet from Isabel's height to find Ned's height:
\[ 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet} \]

Carl is one foot taller than Ned, so we add 1 foot to Ned's height to find Carl's height:
\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet} \]

Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so we divide Carl's height by 2 to find the length of the cane:
\[ \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet} \]

So, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve this, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Daily Energy Demand Calculation:**
   - Each person's daily energy need is covered by 20% of a bottle of juice.
   - So, to cover 100% of a person's daily energy need, you need 5 bottles of juice (since 100% / 20% = 5).

2. **Total Bottles Needed:**
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
     \[
     2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Bottles Currently Produced:**
   - Hortex produces 4200 bottles per day.

4. **Additional Bottles Needed:**
   - To find out how many more bottles are needed, subtract the current production from the total needed:
     \[
     11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
     \]

So, Hortex needs to produce an additional 7300 bottles of juice to meet the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7300}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Carla has 8 babies in total. She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue.

First, we calculate how many babies are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue:
- Number of babies in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we find out how many of these babies wear bows. The problem states that all the babies in blue and 1/3 of the babies in purple wear bows:
- Babies in blue wearing bows = 1 (since 1/3 of 2 is approximately 0.66, we round to 1)
- Babies in purple wearing bows = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
\[ 1 + 2 = 3 \]

Now, we need to find the percentage of babies wearing bows that are in purple. We use the number of purple babies wearing bows and the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

So, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is approximately 66.67%.

The final answer is:
\[ 66.67\% \]"
"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the reports received on Monday and Tuesday, and the reports received on Thursday and Friday, from the total number of reports received last week.

The total number of reports received last week is 5168.

The number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.

The number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

So, the number of reports received on Wednesday is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Abraham starts with 80 square meters of land.

1. He sells half of it, which is 40 square meters, for $50. So, the price per square meter is:
   \[
   \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

2. After a month, he sells another 1/4 of his land, which is 20 square meters, for $30. So, the price per square meter is:
   \[
   \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

3. The remaining land is:
   \[
   80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   He sells this remaining land for $3 per square meter. So, the revenue from the remaining land is:
   \[
   20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}

"Okay, let's break it down simply:

Tyrion goes out 3 times a day and changes his face mask 2 times each time he goes out. So, every time he goes out, he uses 2 face masks. Since he goes out 3 times a day, he uses \(3 \times 2 = 6\) face masks each day.

Now, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in 2 days. If he uses 6 face masks in one day, then in 2 days he would use \(6 \times 2 = 12\) face masks.

So, the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 times 12, so that's 36 eggs.

Lamar found 5 eggs.
Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, so that's 2 times 5, which is 10 eggs.
Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, so that's 10 minus 2, which is 8 eggs.
Mei found half as many as Charlie, so that's 8 divided by 2, which is 4 eggs.

Now, let's add up all the eggs they found:
5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs they found from the total number of eggs Cole hid:
36 (total hidden) - 27 (found) = 9 eggs.

So, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9."

\[ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments} \]

The third complex has 60% more apartments than the first two combined. So, we calculate 60% of 400:
\[ 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ apartments} \]

Adding this to the 400 apartments from the first two complexes:
\[ 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments} \]

So, the total number of apartments he collects garbage from is:
\[ 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments} \]

He collects garbage 3 times a week, so the total number of collections in a week is:
\[ 1040 \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections} \]

He gets paid $0.40 for each collection, so his weekly earnings are:
\[ 3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money John makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{1248} \]"
"To find out how many fruits an avocado tree can produce over its 10 years, let's break it down year by year:

- At 5 years old, the tree produces 50 fruits.
- At 6 years old, it produces 3 times the amount of the 5-year-old tree, so that's \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.
- At 7 years old, it produces 7 times the amount of the 5-year-old tree, so that's \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.
- At 8 years old, it produces 200 less than a 10-year-old tree. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the amount of the 5-year-old tree, so that's \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits. Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces \(1000 - 200 = 800\) fruits.
- At 9 years old, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
- At 10 years old, it produces 20 times the amount of the 5-year-old tree, so that's \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits produced over the 10 years:
\[50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000 = 2350\]

So, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{2350}\)."
"Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, which is $20. Jack originally had $100. So, if we add the $20 Sophia gave him to the $100 he already had, we get:

\[
100 + 20 = 120
\]

So, Jack now has $120. 

The correct answer is: **$120**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so if we let the length of the blue rope be \( B \), then the red rope \( R \) is \( 4B \).

We also know the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so if we let the length of the yellow rope be \( Y \), then \( B = Y - 7 \).

The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + Y = 37 \]

Substituting \( R = 4B \) and \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 4B + B + Y = 37 \]
\[ 5B + Y = 37 \]

Since \( B = Y - 7 \), we can substitute \( Y \) with \( B + 7 \):
\[ 5B + (B + 7) = 37 \]
\[ 6B + 7 = 37 \]
\[ 6B = 30 \]
\[ B = 5 \]

Now that we know \( B = 5 \), we can find \( R \):
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters. The correct answer is:

\(\boxed{20}\)"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ronnie was given $5. Rissa was given three times as much, so she got $15.

After giving some money to their sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means she gave away 1/5 of her money to her sister. Since 1/5 of $15 is $3, Rissa gave $3 to her sister.

Ronnie also gave $3 to her sister. So, the amount left with Ronnie is $5 - $3 = $2.

Therefore, the amount left in Ronnie's money is $2. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. The mural has equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and half the mural is yellow.

First, we know that half the mural is yellow, so:
\[ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Since the red, white, and purple paints are equal, let's say each of these colors uses \( R \) pints. So we have:
\[ R + R + R + 6 = 12 \]
\[ 3R + 6 = 12 \]

Now, we solve for \( R \):
\[ 3R = 12 - 6 \]
\[ 3R = 6 \]
\[ R = 2 \]

So, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate the area of one bedroom:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area for the bedrooms is:
\[ 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet} \]

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so:
\[ 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet} \]

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.

Now, we add up all these areas to get the total area of the house:
\[ 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet} \]

So, the total area of the house is 3160 square feet."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out how many puffs of clouds Alice sees each day and then sum them up.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Monday, so that's \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, so that's \(2 \times 6 = 12\) puffs.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, so that's \(2 \times 12 = 24\) puffs.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, so that's \(2 \times 24 = 48\) puffs.

Now, let's add up all the puffs of clouds she saw from Monday to Friday:

\[3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48\]

Adding these step by step:

\[3 + 6 = 9\]
\[9 + 12 = 21\]
\[21 + 24 = 45\]
\[45 + 48 = 93\]

So, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is 93. 

The final answer is \(\boxed{93}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the original box of dishwasher pods has 100 pods and costs $12. The new box has 20% more pods than the original box. So, we need to find out how many pods are in the new box.

To find out how many more pods are in the new box, we calculate 20% of 100 pods:
\[ 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods} \]

So, the new box has:
\[ 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods} \]

The new box costs $12, so the cost per pod is:
\[ \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod} \]

Now, if we want to know how many cycles we can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per pod:
\[ \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ cycles} \]

So, the number of dishwashing cycles we can run for $1 is 10. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he gets, we divide $1000 by $20:
   \[
   \frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
   \]

2. He loses 10 bills on the way home. So, he has:
   \[
   50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
   \]

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 is:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
   \]
   So, he has:
   \[
   40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills left}
   \]

4. He then triples his money. Since each bill is worth $20, his total money is:
   \[
   20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Tripling this amount gives:
   \[
   3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. Finally, he converts all his money to $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills he has, we divide $1200 by $5:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
   \]

So, Thomas has 240 $5 bills. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{240}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

In the first half:
- Team A scored 4 goals.
- Team B scored 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scored \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

In the second half:
- Team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so Team B scored \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
- Team A scored \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals Team B scored in the second half, so Team A scored \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

Now, let's add up all the goals:
- Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
- Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).

So, the total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday.

2. **Chalk Usage on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. So, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Therefore, the chalk remaining after Monday is:
   \[
   5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Chalk Recycled**: Since the teacher cannot write with a very small piece of chalk, he recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. The remaining chalk after Monday is 2.75 inches, which is greater than 2 inches, so no chalk is recycled yet.

4. **Daily Usage**: The teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. So, the chalk used each day is 20% of the remaining chalk.

5. **Chalk Remaining Calculation**:
   - **Tuesday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 2.75 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Wednesday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 2.20 = 0.44 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 2.20 - 0.44 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Thursday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 1.76 = 0.352 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 1.76 - 0.352 = 1.408 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Friday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 1.408 = 0.2816 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 1.408 - 0.2816 = 1.1264 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Saturday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 1.1264 = 0.22528 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 1.1264 - 0.22528 = 0.90112 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Sunday**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.90112 = 0.180224 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.90112 - 0.180224 = 0.720896 \text{ inches}
     \]

6. **Recycling Condition**: The teacher will recycle the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches. Since the chalk remaining on Sunday is 0.720896 inches, it is not recycled yet.

7. **Recycling Condition Check for Next Day**:
   - **Monday of Next Week**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.720896 = 0.1441792 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.720896 - 0.1441792 = 0.5767168 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Tuesday of Next Week**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.5767168 = 0.11534336 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.5767168 - 0.11534336 = 0.46137344 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Wednesday of Next Week**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.46137344 = 0.092274688 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.46137344 - 0.092274688 = 0.369098752 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Thursday of Next Week**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.369098752 = 0.0738197504 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.369098752 - 0.0738197504 = 0.2952790016 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Friday of Next Week**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.2952790016 = 0.05905580032 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.2952790016 - 0.05905580032 = 0.23622320128 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Saturday of Next Week**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.23622320128 = 0.047244640256 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.23622320128 - 0.047244640256 = 0.188978561024 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - **Sunday of Next Week**:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used} = 0.20 \times 0.188978561024 = 0.0377957122048 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Chalk remaining} = 0.188978561024 - 0.0377957122048 = 0.1511828488192 \text{ inches}
     \]

Since the chalk remaining on Sunday of the next week is 0.1511828488192 inches, which is still greater than 2 inches, the teacher will continue to use the chalk until it is recycled.

8. **Days Calculation**:
   - Monday to Sunday of the next week: 7 days

Therefore, the teacher has 7 days before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls. We need to find out how many students are not on varsity.

First, we calculate how many girls are on varsity. Since one-third of the girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

Next, we calculate how many boys are on varsity. Since one-fourth of the boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Now, we find out how many girls are not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

And how many boys are not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

To find the total number of students not on varsity, we add the number of girls and boys not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

So, the number of students not on varsity is 17. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mike bought 5 face masks. Now, Johnny bought 2 more than three times what Mike bought. So, we first find out how many face masks three times what Mike bought is. Three times 5 is 15. Then we add 2 to 15, which gives us 17.

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks. The answer is 17."
"Sure, let's go through the problem again step by step.

James has 30 teeth. His dentist drills 4 of them and caps 7 more teeth than he drills. We need to find out what percentage of James' teeth the dentist fixes.

First, let's figure out how many teeth the dentist caps. The problem states that the dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills. Since he drills 4 teeth, the number of teeth he caps is:
\[ 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we need to find out the total number of teeth the dentist fixes. This is the sum of the teeth he drills and the teeth he caps:
\[ 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Now, to find out what percentage of James' teeth the dentist fixes, we use the formula for percentage:
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = 0.5 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage fixed} = 50\% \]

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon. So, the total cost was:
\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

He returned 2/5 of the milk because it had passed its expiry date. So, the amount of milk he returned is:
\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

Since the milk he returned was worth $3.5 per gallon, the refund amount is:
\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5600."
"Let's solve this step by step.

We have two pieces of information:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

From the first statement:
\[ W = 5(C + 7) \]

From the second statement:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \]

Now, we substitute the first equation into the second equation:
\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} \times 5(C + 7) \]
\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

To clear the fraction, multiply both sides by 3:
\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]
\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Now, let's isolate \( C \):
\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

So, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

To verify, let's check the values:
1. If Colin is 20, then in 7 years, he will be 27. Wendy's age is five times this, so:
\[ W = 5 \times 27 = 135 \]
2. In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \). Wendy's current age is 135, so in 25 years, she will be \( 135 + 25 = 160 \). And indeed:
\[ 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Bob has $27,000 to spend on books. We know that he can buy 100 books for $500. First, we need to find out how many books he can buy with $27,000.

To do this, we divide $27,000 by $500 to find out how many sets of 100 books he can buy:
\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]
So, he can buy 54 sets of 100 books. Now, we multiply 54 by 100 to find the total number of books:
\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]
Bob can buy 5400 books in total.

Now, he wants to distribute these 5400 books equally among 3 schools. To find out how many books each school gets, we divide 5400 by 3:
\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]
So, each school gets 1800 books.

Therefore, the number of books each school can get is 1800. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1800} \]"
"Let's go through the events step by step to figure out how many apples Newton brought home.

1. Initially, two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 2

2. Newton picked up these two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree. This caused another two apples to fall out.
   - Apples on the ground: 2 (remaining apple) + 2 (new apples) = 4
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1 (pocketed apple) + 1 (thrown apple) = 2

3. Newton picked up the remaining apple, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the last one at the tree. This caused six more apples to fall out.
   - Apples on the ground: 4 (remaining apples) + 6 (new apples) = 10
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 2 (pocketed apples) + 1 (thrown apple) = 3

4. Newton picked up all the remaining apples (10 more apples fell out).
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 3 (pocketed apples) + 10 (picked up apples) = 13

So, Newton brought home 13 apples. The final answer is 13."
"To find out how much Ali's order of 850 kilos of coal costs, we need to figure out how many 50 kilo bags he gets and then multiply that by the cost per bag.

First, we divide the total kilos of coal by the kilos per bag:

\[
\frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Now, we know he gets 17 bags, and each bag costs $18. So, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

So, the total cost of Ali's order is $306. 

The correct answer is: **306**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many cheese pizza slices are eaten in total. If each of Kate's 6 friends eats 6 slices of cheese pizza, we multiply:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ slices} \]

Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, we need to find out how many cheese pizzas are needed for 36 slices:

\[ \frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

Next, we need to find out how many pepperoni pizza slices are eaten in total. If each of Kate's 6 friends eats 4 slices of pepperoni pizza, we multiply:

\[ 6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, we need to find out how many pepperoni pizzas are needed for 24 slices:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \]

So, Kate needs 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas. Adding these together:

\[ 3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = 6 \text{ pizzas} \]

Therefore, the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy is 6. The correct answer is:

**6**"
"To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day.

- On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So for these three days, the total miles are:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}
  \]

- On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So for these two days, the total miles are:
  \[
  5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}
  \]

Now, we add the miles from both sets of days:
\[
9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is 19 miles. 

The correct answer is 19 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Jay can make 20 snowballs in an hour, but 2 of them melt every 15 minutes. First, we need to find out how many snowballs Jay actually makes in an hour after accounting for the ones that melt.

- In 15 minutes, 2 snowballs melt.
- So, in 15 minutes, Jay makes \(20 / 4 = 5\) snowballs (since 20 snowballs in an hour means 4 intervals of 15 minutes, and \(20 / 4 = 5\)).
- Therefore, in an hour, Jay makes \(5 \times 4 = 20 - 8 = 12\) snowballs.

Now, we need to find out how many hours it takes for Jay to make 60 snowballs. Since he makes 12 snowballs in an hour, we divide 60 by 12:

\[ 60 \div 12 = 5 \]

So, it will take Jay 5 hours to make 60 snowballs. The answer is \(\boxed{5}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that when the show came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John is 28 years old now, we need to find out how old Jim was then.

If John is 28 now, that means the difference in their ages has been constant over time. So, when the show came out, John was 28 years old, and Jim was half that age because John was twice as old as Jim at that time.

So, if John was 28, Jim was:

\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

This means Jim was 14 years old when the show came out. Since no time has passed, Jim is still 14 years old now.

So, the final answer is:

14"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way:

Doxa sliced an apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice. Her sister ate 1 more slice than Doxa, so her sister ate 2 slices. Her brother ate 1 more slice than her sister, so her brother ate 3 slices.

Now, let's add up how many slices they all ate:
- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate 2 slices.
- Her brother ate 3 slices.

So, the total number of slices they ate together is \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).

The final answer is 6 slices."
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many bandages they started with on the first day.

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 + 100 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used \(81 - 78 = 3\) bandages more than they needed to reach 78 bandages.

Since they had 81 bandages after ordering and using 25, and they ended up with 78, it means they used 3 more bandages than necessary. This confirms the calculations.

So, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{62}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

May's hair was originally 10 inches long and ended up being 8 inches long. So, she had 2 inches of hair cut off. The cost of cutting the hair is $30 per inch. Therefore, the cost for cutting 2 inches is:

\[ 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars/inch} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The cost of the hair color is $40. So, the total cost for the haircut and color is:

\[ 60 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost is \(\boxed{100}\) dollars."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much Jen will receive for April.

First, we need to calculate how much Jen earns in a day. She works 7.5 hours a day and her hourly rate is $1.5.

So, her daily earnings are:
\[ 7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$11.25/\text{day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much she earns in a week. She works 6 days a week, so:
\[ \$11.25/\text{day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = \$67.50/\text{week} \]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:
\[ \$67.50/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$270.00 \]

Jen also gets an extra $10 for each week she has complete attendance. Since she didn't miss any days in April, she gets this bonus for 4 weeks:
\[ \$10/\text{week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$40.00 \]

Now, we add her total earnings for the month and her total attendance bonus:
\[ \$270.00 + \$40.00 = \$310.00 \]

So, Jen will receive:
\[
\boxed{310}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much money Jason earned.

First, we calculate the earnings from each task:

1. **Earnings from doing laundry:** Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from laundry} = 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room:** Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} = 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Earnings from taking the trash out:** Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out each week. Since he took the trash out twice in the two-week period:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from taking the trash out} = 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:** Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher each time. Since he emptied the dishwasher 6 times:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher} = 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

Now, we add up all the earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00
\]

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{9.00}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We know that each whale has 40 gallons of blood. A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so we can calculate the blood in one shark like this:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Now, we want to find out how much blood ten sharks have together. So we multiply the blood in one shark by 10:

\[ \text{Blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is 1200 gallons. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{1200}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step to find out the total number of people who entered the restaurant.

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
2. At 10:00, 40 more people came in. These 40 people ordered the same amount of food as the first 50 people.
3. After that, twice the number of people who came in at 10:00 came in later. So, \(2 \times 40 = 80\) people came in later.
4. By evening, 3 times as many people as the first 50 people came in. So, \(3 \times 50 = 150\) people came in by evening.

Now, let's add all these numbers together to find the total number of people who entered the restaurant:

\[ 50 \text{ (morning)} + 40 \text{ (10:00)} + 80 \text{ (later)} + 150 \text{ (evening)} = 320 \]

So, the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day is 320. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{320}\)."
"Okay, let me break it down in a simpler way.

Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack has 5 pens. So, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

She also bought twice as many packs of black pens as red pens. So, she bought:
\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs of black pens} \]

Each pack of black pens also has 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:
\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Now, to find the total number of pens Alain has, we add the red pens and the black pens together:
\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

So, the total number of pens Alain has is 75."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600. So, the cost of one bottle of scotch is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, the cognac costs 50% more than the scotch. So, the cost of one bottle of cognac is:

\[ \text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

John buys twice as many bottles of cognac as he does of scotch. Since he buys 10 bottles of scotch, he buys:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac} \]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[ \text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, we add the cost of the scotch and the cost of the cognac to find the total amount John spends:

\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount John spends is $2400."
"Sure, let's go through the problem again step by step to find out the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees. So, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40
     \]

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day. So, the number of White Oak trees he planted is:
     \[
     20 + 10 = 30
     \]
   - On the second day, he planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day. So, the number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted is:
     \[
     40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50
     \]

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - The total number of White Oak trees planted over the two days is:
     \[
     20 \text{ (first day)} + 30 \text{ (second day)} = 50
     \]
   - The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days is:
     \[
     40 \text{ (first day)} + 50 \text{ (second day)} = 90
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
     \[
     50 \text{ (White Oak)} + 90 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 140
     \]

So, the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted is 140. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"Let's go through the problem step by step to find out how much root beer is left for the party.

1. Fred starts with 24 gallons of root beer.
2. His children drink 4 gallons, so we subtract 4 from 24:
   \[
   24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]
3. Barbie spills 7 gallons, so we subtract 7 from 20:
   \[
   20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]
4. Ronnie drinks 5 gallons, so we subtract 5 from 13:
   \[
   13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]
5. On the fourth day, 3 people show up for the party. To find out how much each person gets, we divide the remaining 8 gallons by 3:
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons per person}
   \]

So, the amount of root beer available for each person to drink during the party is \(\frac{8}{3}\) gallons. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}
\]"
"Okay, let's solve this step by step.

We have the equation: \(4x + 8 = 40\).

First, we need to get rid of the 8 on the left side. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8\]
\[4x = 32\]

Now, to find \(x\), we divide both sides by 4:
\[\frac{4x}{4} = \frac{32}{4}\]
\[x = 8\]

So, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

The final answer is:
\[8\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step with simpler numbers to understand it better.

We start with 66 fish in the tank. One-third of these fish have red stripes. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
\]

After the fish with red stripes are taken out, we have:

\[
66 - 22 = 44 \text{ fish left}
\]

Out of these 44 fish, 5/11 have blue stripes. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
\]

Now, to find out how many fish have either red or blue stripes, we add the two numbers together:

\[
22 + 20 = 42
\]

So, the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes is 42. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{42}
\]"
"Let's break it down step by step:

Amy starts with two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors. So, that's \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors from the palettes. She also has three makeup sets, each with 6 colors, so that's \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors from the makeup sets. Adding these together, she has \(8 + 18 = 26\) colors in total.

When her sister steals one of the palettes, she loses 4 colors. So now she has \(26 - 4 = 22\) colors left.

Then, she uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of that is \(6 / 2 = 3\) colors. So, after using up half of one makeup set, she has \(22 - 3 = 19\) colors left.

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Mattison is 60 inches tall. The house is 7 times his height, so the house is:
\[ 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches} \]

The first floor is three times Mattison's height, so the first floor is:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches} \]

Since the total height of the house is 420 inches and the first floor is 180 inches, the second floor must be:
\[ 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches} \]

So, the height of the roof from the floor of the second floor is 240 inches. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{240} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many shells team Alphas found. They found 40% of the 700 shells. So, we calculate:
\[ 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \]
This means team Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we subtract the shells found by Alphas from the total number of shells to find out how many are left:
\[ 700 - 280 = 420 \]
So, there are 420 shells left.

Now, team The finders found 60% of these remaining 420 shells. So, we calculate:
\[ 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \]
This means team The finders found 252 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the shells found by The finders from the remaining shells:
\[ 420 - 252 = 168 \]
So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

Therefore, the number of shells team Gogetters found is \(\boxed{168}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the average distance all four dogs need to walk per day is 3 miles. So, the total distance they need to walk together is:
\[ 3 \text{ miles/dog} \times 4 \text{ dogs} = 12 \text{ miles} \]

We already know the distances for the first three dogs:
- The first dog walks 1 mile.
- The second dog walks 4 miles.
- The third dog walks 3 miles.

Now, let's add up the distances for these three dogs:
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we subtract the total distance walked by the first three dogs from the total distance needed:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 8 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles} \]

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles.

The final answer is:
4 miles"
"Okay, let me break it down step by step in a simpler way.

John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan that is 40% of that. So, we calculate 40% of $250,000:

\[ 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000 \]

This means John gets a loan of $100,000. He uses 60% of this loan to pay off his debts. So, we calculate 60% of $100,000:

\[ 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000 \]

Now, to find out how much money he has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount he used to pay off his debts from the loan amount:

\[ 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 \]

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{40000}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Deandre caught three tunas. The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms, the second weighs 46 kilograms, and the third weighs 26 kilograms. We need to find the total weight of the tunas first.

Adding the weights together:
\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Now, we know that each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50. To find out how much Deandre will earn, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:
\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars per kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{64} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Trinity buys magazines for $72 each. She sells them for 11/8 of that price. To find out how much she sells them for, we need to calculate 11/8 of $72.

First, let's do the multiplication:
\[ \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99 \]

So, she sells each magazine for $99.

Now, to find out her profit, we subtract the cost price from the selling price:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 99 - 72 = 27 \]

So, Trinity's profit is $27.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Brian's dehumidifier has three settings:
- Low setting: 1 liter of water removed per day.
- Medium setting: Twice as much as the low setting, so 2 liters per day.
- High setting: Twice as much as the medium setting, so 4 liters per day.

Brian used the dehumidifier for different periods:
- 3 days on the low setting.
- 3 days on the medium setting.
- 5 days on the high setting.

First, let's calculate the water removed each day for each setting:
- For the low setting: 1 liter per day for 3 days = 1 * 3 = 3 liters.
- For the medium setting: 2 liters per day for 3 days = 2 * 3 = 6 liters.
- For the high setting: 4 liters per day for 5 days = 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

Now, let's add up all the water removed:
- Water removed on low setting: 3 liters
- Water removed on medium setting: 6 liters
- Water removed on high setting: 20 liters

Total water removed = 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.

So, the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement is 29 liters. The correct answer is \boxed{29}."
"Okay, let me explain this step by step in a simpler way.

Jolene and her friends filled up 10 packs of water balloons, and each pack had 30 balloons. So, we first find out how many balloons they had in total:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 30 \text{ balloons per pack} = 300 \text{ balloons} \]

By the end of the afternoon, they had 12 balloons left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:

\[ 300 \text{ balloons} - 12 \text{ balloons} = 288 \text{ balloons} \]

So, the number of balloons they threw is 288. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{288}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how much medicine is in one dose. The problem says that for one dose, Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. So, the second medicine amount is:

\[ 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL} \]

Now, the total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicine amounts:

\[ 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} = 56 \text{ mL} \]

Next, we need to find out how much medicine is in 8 doses. We do this by multiplying the amount of medicine in one dose by 8:

\[ 56 \text{ mL} \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL} \]

So, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 448 mL. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{448}\) mL."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students.

John's class has half the capacity of Ali's class because it's given that each of John's classes has \( \frac{1}{8} \) the capacity of Ali's class. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Capacity of John's class} = \frac{120}{8} = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:

\[
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Now, to find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's class and John's classes:

\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

So, the combined capacity of both schools is 150 students. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an extra 2%. First, we need to calculate the extra amount he has to pay. The extra amount is 2% of $300, which is:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]
So, the total amount Stephen has to return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

Next, Stephen will pay $25 each month for 11 months. The total amount he will pay in these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

Now, to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we subtract the amount he has already paid from the total amount he has to return:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Jordan has 2 children, and each child needs 5 diaper changes per day. So, the total number of diaper changes per day is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

2. Jordan's wife changes half of the diaper changes. So, she changes \(10 \div 2 = 5\) diaper changes per day.

3. The rest of the diaper changes are done by Jordan. Since there are 10 diaper changes in total and his wife handles 5, Jordan must handle the other 5.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day. 

The final answer is: 5"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how much space the jelly beans take up in the jar. The jar is a square with each side being 6 inches, so the base area is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ square inches} \]
The jar is 15 inches tall, so the volume of the jar is:
\[ 36 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, we know that the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, so the effective volume they take up is:
\[ 540 \times 0.80 = 432 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Each jelly bean takes up 0.15 cubic inches, so the number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar is:
\[ \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \text{ jelly beans} \]

Tim thinks that 30% of these jelly beans are red, so the estimated number of red jelly beans is:
\[ 2880 \times 0.30 = 864 \text{ red jelly beans} \]

But we know the true number of red jelly beans is 900. So, how far off was his guess? We find the difference:
\[ 900 - 864 = 36 \]

So, Tim was 36 jelly beans off. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}

4. At the third stop, the number of people on the bus doubles. So, the number of people on the bus becomes:
   \[
   90 \times 2 = 180
   \]
5. The bus has a capacity of 200 people. To find out how many more people can fit on the bus, we subtract the number of people already on the bus from the bus's capacity:
   \[
   200 - 180 = 20
   \]

So, the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

1. **Initial Cost per Visit:** The cost of one visit is $2.
2. **Cost After 5 Years:** The cost increased by 150%, so the increase is $2 * 1.5 = $3. Adding this to the original cost, the new cost is $2 + $3 = $5.
3. **Total Visits Over 8 Years:** Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year for 8 years, so she visits 3 * 8 = 24 times.
4. **Cost for the First 5 Years:** For the first 5 years, she visits 3 times a year, so she visits 3 * 5 = 15 times. The cost for these visits is 15 * $2 = $30.
5. **Cost for the Next 3 Years:** For the next 3 years, she visits 3 times a year, so she visits 3 * 3 = 9 times. The cost for these visits is 9 * $5 = $45.
6. **Total Cost for All Visits:** Adding the costs from both periods, we get $30 + $45 = $75.

So, the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum is $75."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Cedar Falls Middle School has students in grades 4, 5, and 6. There are 10 students in each grade, so the total number of students is:
\[ 10 \text{ students/grade} \times 3 \text{ grades} = 30 \text{ students} \]

Only 8 students can try the escape room at a time. To find out how many groups we need, we divide the total number of students by the number of students that can try at once:
\[ \frac{30 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students/group}} = 3.75 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we round up to the next whole number, which means we need 4 groups.

Each group takes 45 minutes to try the escape room. So, the total time required for all groups to try the escape room is:
\[ 4 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes/group} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take for everyone to try the escape room is:
\[ \boxed{180} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John made 4 wooden tables, and each table costs $20. So, the cost for the tables is:
\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Next, John made 2 roof frames, and each frame costs $10. So, the cost for the frames is:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, to find out how much Ali has to pay in total, we add the cost of the tables and the frames together:
\[ 80 + 20 = 100 \]

So, Ali has to pay John $100. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total length of the board is 40 feet. Let's say the shorter piece is \( x \) feet long. Then the longer piece would be \( 4x \) feet long because it's 4 times longer than the shorter piece.

So, if we add the lengths of the shorter and longer pieces together, we get the total length of the board:
\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long. Now, to find the length of the longer piece, we multiply the shorter piece by 4:
\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the longer piece is 32 feet long.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To figure out how much of Aiden's secret seasoning he needs, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know that Aiden makes 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. He wants to make 80 meatballs. To find out how many pounds of ground beef he needs, we divide the number of meatballs he wants by the number of meatballs he gets from each pound:

\[
\text{Pounds of ground beef} = \frac{\text{Number of meatballs}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80}{16} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we know that for every pound of ground beef, Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of his secret seasoning. So, to find out how much seasoning he needs for 5 pounds of ground beef, we multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound:

\[
\text{Amount of seasoning} = \text{Pounds of ground beef} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
\]

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret seasoning. The correct answer is:

"Luke needs to buy fabric for five windows, and each window is 35 inches wide. So, the total width of all the windows is:

\[ 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches} \]

Luke needs to buy fabric that is 2 times the total width of the windows. Therefore, the amount of fabric he should buy is:

\[ 2 \times 175 = 350 \text{ inches} \]

So, the amount of fabric Luke should buy is 350 inches."
"To calculate the cost of a 36-minute call, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 16 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes.

For the first 16 minutes, the cost is $0.25 per minute. So, we calculate:
\[ 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

For the remaining 20 minutes, the cost is $0.2 per minute. So, we calculate:
\[ 20 \times 0.2 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost for the 36-minute call:
\[ 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost of a 36-minute call is $8.00.

The correct answer is:

"To find out how much rain there will be on Tuesday, we start with the amount of rain on Monday, which is 2 inches. The problem says that Tuesday's rain will be 1 inch more than twice the amount of rain on Monday. So, let's break it down step by step:

1. Twice the amount of rain on Monday is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) inches.
2. Adding 1 inch to that gives us \(4 + 1 = 5\) inches.

So, the amount of rain on Tuesday will be 5 inches. 

The correct answer is 5 inches."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If we let \( C \) be the number of cupcakes, then the number of brownies \( B \) can be expressed as:
\[ B = 3C - 2 \]

We also know that there are 5 people in the class and each person gets 2 treats. So, the total number of treats is:
\[ 5 \times 2 = 10 \]

The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies:
\[ C + B = 10 \]

Now, we substitute \( B \) with \( 3C - 2 \):
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. To check, if she made 3 cupcakes, then the number of brownies would be:
\[ B = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \]

The total number of treats is:
\[ 3 + 7 = 10 \]

This matches the total number of treats needed. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure:
- A basic manicure costs $35.
- A basic pedicure costs $40.

So, the total cost for both services without any discounts is:
\[ 35 + 40 = 75 \]

The salon offers a 20% discount if you get both services. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:
\[ 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[ 75 - 15 = 60 \]

So, the cost after the discount is $60. Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total, and each nail art service costs $3:
\[ 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Now, we add the cost of the nail art to the discounted total cost of the manicure and pedicure:
\[ 60 + 30 = 90 \]

Therefore, the total amount Karen would pay is:
\[ \boxed{90} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Susan has 3 magazines that each send 12 issues a year. So, that's:
\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ issues} \]

She also has 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year. So, that's:
\[ 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ issues} \]

Lastly, she has 1 magazine that sends 4 times the amount of the 6 issue magazine. So, that's:
\[ 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ issues} \]

Now, let's add all these up to find out how many magazines she gets every year:
\[ 36 + 6 + 24 = 66 \text{ issues} \]

Since each issue is from a different magazine, she gets 66 magazines every year.

So, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{66} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know Samantha has 27 paintings. According to the problem, Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley. So, if we add 12 to Samantha's paintings, we can find out how many paintings Shelley has:
\[ 27 + 12 = 39 \]
So, Shelley has 39 paintings.

Next, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. If we subtract 8 from Shelley's paintings, we can find out how many paintings Kim has:
\[ 39 - 8 = 31 \]
So, Kim has 31 paintings.

Therefore, the number of paintings Kim has is \(\boxed{31}\)."
"Okay, let me walk you through it step by step.

In November, the toy costs $40. In December, the price goes up by 80%. To find out how much the price goes up, we calculate 80% of $40:
\[ 0.80 \times 40 = 32 \]
So, the price in December becomes:
\[ 40 + 32 = 72 \]
In January, the price goes down by 50%. To find out how much the price goes down, we calculate 50% of $72:
\[ 0.50 \times 72 = 36 \]
So, the price in January becomes:
\[ 72 - 36 = 36 \]
Therefore, the price of the toy after it was discounted in January is $36."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Charlie has 4 lessons at $80 per hour. So, for these lessons, he makes:
\[ 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, he has 2 lessons for veterans at a reduced rate. The reduced rate is 25% off the standard rate, so:
\[ 80 - (80 \times 0.25) = 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

For the 2 veteran lessons, he makes:
\[ 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find the total amount of money he makes for the day, we add the money from the standard lessons and the veteran lessons:
\[ 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is:

"To find Sally's mean score, we need to add up all her quiz scores and then divide by the number of quizzes she took.

First, let's add up all her scores: 50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60.

Adding these step by step:
50 + 80 = 130
130 + 80 = 210
210 + 60 = 270
270 + 40 = 310
310 + 90 = 400
400 + 100 = 500
500 + 70 = 570
570 + 60 = 630

So, the sum of all her scores is 630.

Now, we need to count how many quizzes she took. She took 9 quizzes.

To find the mean, we divide the total sum of the scores by the number of quizzes:
Mean = 630 ÷ 9 = 70

Therefore, Sally's mean score is 70.

15"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Walter bought 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them, so he ate:

\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
\]

After eating 24 apples, he had:

\[
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples}
\]

Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining 36 apples. To find out how many apples that is, we calculate 25% of 36:

\[
0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
\]

So, he gave his sister 9 apples, leaving him with:

\[
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}

"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

We know Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and that's 3 quarters of the number of novels she wrote this year. To find out how many novels she wrote this year, we can set up the equation:

\[ 9 = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{number of novels this year} \]

To find the number of novels she wrote this year, we need to solve for the number of novels. First, we can eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 4:

\[ 9 \times 4 = 3 \times \text{number of novels this year} \]
\[ 36 = 3 \times \text{number of novels this year} \]

Now, we divide both sides by 3 to find the number of novels:

\[ \text{number of novels this year} = \frac{36}{3} \]
\[ \text{number of novels this year} = 12 \]

So, Regina wrote 12 novels this year. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Michael is traveling at a speed of 50 km/hr. If he travels for 3 days, and there are 24 hours in a day, then in 3 days he travels for:
\[ 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours} \]

If he travels at 50 km/hr for 72 hours, the total distance he covers is:
\[ 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km} \]

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. To find out what percentage of the total distance Michael has covered, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100 = 60\% \]

So, the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered is 60%.

The final answer is:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.
3. The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes.
4. Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, so the total number of grapes used for the pies is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) grapes.
5. The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and the grapes used for the pies. So, the total number of grapes at the beginning is \(36 + 48 = 84\) grapes.

Therefore, the total number of grapes at the beginning is 84. The correct answer is:

"To find out how many teachers were at school, we need to subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers and then add the number of substitute teachers.

Total number of teachers = 82
Number of sick teachers = 13
Number of substitute teachers = 9

So, the calculation is:
Number of teachers at school = 82 - 13 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 69 + 9
Number of teachers at school = 78

Therefore, the number of teachers at school that day is 78.

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. Here's what he spends each week:
- Pasta costs $1.00.
- Cheddar cheese costs $3.00.
- Gruyere cheese costs twice as much as the cheddar cheese, so that's $3.00 * 2 = $6.00.

Now, let's add these up to find out how much Bud spends in one week:
- $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Since Bud makes this once a week, we need to find out how much he spends in a year. There are 52 weeks in a year, so we multiply the weekly cost by 52:
- $10.00 * 52 = $520.00.

So, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year. The correct answer is:

\boxed{520.00}"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many minutes the custodian spends cleaning all the classrooms. There are 80 classrooms, and it takes 15 minutes to clean each one. So, we multiply 80 by 15:
\[ 80 \times 15 = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we need to convert these minutes into hours because the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 1200 by 60:
\[ 1200 \div 60 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours a day. To find out what percentage of their day they spend cleaning, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Cleaning time}}{\text{Workday time}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

So, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms. This means they spend more than one full workday cleaning the classrooms in the given 5 days.

"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

Elly has 110 books to organize. She has 4 shelves in total: 2 middle shelves, 1 bottom shelf, and 1 top shelf. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, so the 2 middle shelves together can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold \(20 - 5 = 15\) books.

Now, let's add up the total capacity of all the shelves:
- Middle shelves: 20 books
- Bottom shelf: 20 books
- Top shelf: 15 books

So, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Elly has 110 books, and each bookcase can hold 55 books. To find out how many bookcases she needs, we divide the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase:
\[ \frac{110}{55} = 2 \]

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs. Since one dozen is 12 eggs, she bought:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

The cost of one dozen eggs is $2.40, so for 5 dozens, she paid:
\[ 5 \times 2.40 = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:
\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, she will make:
\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, to find out her profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price:
\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

So, Rose's profit is:

"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Archie buys beef jerky that comes 30 sticks to a bag and costs $18.00. But now, if he buys a bag, he gets it for $3.00 off, so he only pays $15.00 for the bag.

Now, we need to find out how much each stick costs. There are 30 sticks in a bag, and Archie pays $15.00 for the whole bag. So, we divide $15.00 by 30 sticks to find the cost per stick.

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \]

This means each stick costs $0.50. Since we need to know the cost in cents, we convert $0.50 to cents by multiplying by 100.

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \]

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To figure out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we first need to know how many questions she got right on the first test. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct. So, we calculate:

\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

This means Audrey got 42 questions right on the first test. Now, we need to find out how many questions she needs to get right on the second test to pass. The second test has 40 questions, and to pass, she needs to get 70% of the total questions right. The total number of questions on both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, she needs to get 70% of 110 questions right:

\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test is:

"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

Mary makes some strawberry cubes, and the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. She makes a total of 116 ice cubes.

Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is \( S \). Then the number of blueberry cubes is \( 5S - 4 \).

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes, which is 116. So we can write:
\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

To find \( S \), we add 4 to both sides:
\[ 6S = 120 \]

Then we divide both sides by 6:
\[ S = 20 \]

So, Mary made 20 strawberry cubes. Now, to find the number of blueberry cubes, we use the formula \( 5S - 4 \):
\[ 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96 \]

Therefore, Mary made 96 blueberry cubes.

The final answer is:

\[ 40 \text{ games/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 160 \text{ games} \]

Now, in each game, she scores 21 points. So, to find out the total points she has scored, we multiply the total number of games by her average score per game:
\[ 160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3360 \text{ points} \]

So, the total number of points Ara has scored in the four years is 3360 points."
"Brendan started with 10 marbles. When he dropped half of them, he lost 10 / 2 = 5 marbles. So, he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left after the drop. When he searched, he found 3 marbles, so he had 5 + 3 = 8 marbles. But one of those marbles he found was actually a bead, so he got rid of that. Therefore, he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

The number of marbles Brendan ended up with is 7. 

Now, let's look at the multiple-choice options:

"To figure out how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break it down step by step.

First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls, Jason gets 1 customer to come to the dealership. To sell 15 cars, he needs 8 customers because 15 cars divided by 2 cars per customer equals 7.5, and since he can't have half a customer, he needs 8 customers.

Next, we need to find out how many telephone calls he needs to make to get 8 customers. Since 25 calls get him 1 customer, we multiply 25 by 8 to find the total number of calls needed.

So, the calculation is:
\[ 25 \text{ calls/customer} \times 8 \text{ customers} = 200 \text{ calls} \]

Therefore, Jason needs to make 200 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus. The answer is 200."
"Okay, let's break it down again in a simpler way.

They have 4 people in the house, so they need 4 flashlights. There are 8 rooms, and they have 2 flashlights for each room, so that's 8 rooms * 2 flashlights/room = 16 flashlights. But they only need 4, so that's the number of flashlights they use.

Now, let's look at the candles. Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Half of 8 rooms is 4 rooms. So, for the 4 rooms with 4 small candles each, they use 4 rooms * 4 candles/room = 16 small candles. For the 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each, they use 4 rooms * 5 candles/room = 20 medium candles. So, in total, they use 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

Now, adding the flashlights and candles together, they use 4 flashlights + 36 candles = 40 candles and flashlights in total.

So, the correct answer is:

"To find out how long it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube, we need to add up the time he spends on each side. Let's break it down:

- The first side takes 5 minutes.
- The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it's \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes.
- The third side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it's another 10 minutes.
- The fourth side takes half as long as the first side, so it's \(0.5 \times 5 = 2.5\) minutes.
- The fifth side takes half as long as the first side, so it's another 2.5 minutes.

Now, let's add all these times together:

\[ 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube is 30 minutes. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{30}

"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

We know there are 20 helmets. The problem tells us there are half as many robots as helmets, so we can find the number of robots by dividing the number of helmets by 2:
\[ \text{Number of robots} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, the problem also says there are half as many helmets as footballs. So, to find the number of footballs, we need to double the number of helmets:
\[ \text{Number of footballs} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \]

Now, to find the total number of items, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together:
\[ \text{Total number of items} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 \]

So, the total number of items Dominick saw is 70."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tim works 6 hours each day, and there are 5 days in a week. So, he works:
\[ 6 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 30 \text{ hours/week} \]

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total hours into minutes:
\[ 30 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 1800 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Now, we know it takes him 15 minutes to handle one call. To find out how many calls he can handle in a week, we divide the total minutes by the time it takes to handle one call:
\[ \frac{1800 \text{ minutes/week}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 120 \text{ calls/week} \]

So, the number of calls Tim deals with during his 5-day work week is:
\[ 120 \]

The final answer is:

"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Louise usually dries one painting in 7 minutes. If she uses the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes to dry one painting.

First, we calculate how long it takes to dry 6 paintings with the old varnish:
- For one painting, it takes 7 minutes.
- For 6 paintings, it would take \(7 \times 6 = 42\) minutes.

Next, we calculate how long it takes to dry 6 paintings with the new varnish:
- For one painting, it takes 12 minutes.
- For 6 paintings, it would take \(12 \times 6 = 72\) minutes.

Now, we find the difference in time:
- The difference is \(72 - 42 = 30\) minutes.

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old varnish.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Crista has 20 plants in total. We know that 4 of her plants need half a cup of water each day. So, for these 4 plants, she needs:
\[ 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \text{ cups of water} \]

Next, 8 of her plants need 1 cup of water each day. So, for these 8 plants, she needs:
\[ 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups of water} \]

The rest of the plants are the ones that need a quarter of a cup of water each day. Since she has 20 plants in total, the number of these plants is:
\[ 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 \text{ plants} \]
So, for these 8 plants, she needs:
\[ 8 \times 0.25 = 2 \text{ cups of water} \]

Now, we add up all the water needed:
\[ 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups} \]

So, Crista needs \(\boxed{12}\) cups of water every day for her plants."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how long it takes Phineas to get home by hopping and swimming. The total distance is 200 yards, and he needs to split this distance equally between land and water, so each part is 100 yards.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land. He hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute. So, the time to hop 100 yards is:
\[ \text{Time to hop} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in water. He swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute. So, the time to swim 100 yards is:
\[ \text{Time to swim} = \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the time for hopping and the time for swimming to get the total time:
\[ \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes} \]

So, the total time it takes for Phineas to return home is 15 minutes. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To figure out how much Bob needs to spend on popsicle sticks, we can break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many boxes of popsicle sticks Bob needs. Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, and he needs 56 popsicle sticks. So, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number in each box:

\[ \frac{56 \text{ sticks}}{8 \text{ sticks/box}} = 7 \text{ boxes} \]

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Each box costs $2.00, so we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[ 7 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 14 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total cost for Bob to build his project is $14.00. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the main phone costs $20. The problem states that the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. So, if the main phone costs $20, then each additional phone costs half of that, which is $10.

There are five phones in total, and one of them is the main phone. So, we have four additional phones. The cost of the four additional phones is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Now, we add the cost of the main phone to the cost of the four additional phones:
\[ 20 + 40 = 60 \]

So, the total cost of the whole phone plan is $60. 

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to follow these steps:

First, let's figure out how many doughnuts Derrick makes in a day. He makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day, and since one dozen equals 12 doughnuts, we can calculate the number of doughnuts he makes per day as follows:
\[ 10 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ doughnuts/dozen} = 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \]

June has 30 days, so the total number of doughnuts he makes in June is:
\[ 120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \]

Now, since each doughnut is sold for $2, the total money he makes is:
\[ 3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the total amount of money Derrick makes in June is:
\[ \boxed{7200} \]"

She uploads:
\[ 6 \text{ batches/day} \times 7 \text{ photos/batch} = 42 \text{ photos/day} \]

Now, to find out how many days it will take her to upload all 210 photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload in one day:
\[ \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days} \]

So, Jade will need \(\boxed{5}\) days to upload all of her photos."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step for a clearer understanding.

Alicia has clothes to send to the dry cleaners every week. Here's what she has:
- 5 blouses
- 2 pairs of pants
- 1 skirt

The dry cleaners charge:
- $5.00 per blouse
- $6.00 per skirt
- $8.00 per pair of pants

First, let's calculate the cost for one week:
- Cost for blouses: \(5 \text{ blouses} \times \$5.00 \text{ per blouse} = \$25.00\)
- Cost for pants: \(2 \text{ pairs of pants} \times \$8.00 \text{ per pair} = \$16.00\)
- Cost for skirt: \(1 \text{ skirt} \times \$6.00 \text{ per skirt} = \$6.00\)

Now, we add these costs together to find the total cost for one week:
\[
\$25.00 + \$16.00 + \$6.00 = \$47.00
\]

Since Alicia needs to do this every week for 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5:
\[
\$47.00 \times 5 = \$235.00
\]

So, Alicia spends \(\boxed{235.00}\) on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster, so his new speed is:
\[ 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM} \]

Each page has 450 words, and he needs to speak 10 pages. So, the total number of words he needs to speak is:
\[ 10 \times 450 = 4500 \, \text{words} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes him to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. The time it takes is:
\[ \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes} \]

So, it would take him 12 minutes to speak 10 pages. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step with a simpler explanation.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were there than on the first day, so:
\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people} \]

On the third day, the number of people was twice the number from the second day:
\[ 2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people} \]

Now, for the rest of the week (fourth, fifth, and sixth days), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. Since there are 3 days left in the week:
\[ 3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ people} \]

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add the number of people from all the days together:
\[ 50 + 70 + 140 + 180 = 440 \]

So, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
\[ \boxed{440} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way:

1. In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels pop.
2. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate triples, so \(3 \times 20 = 60\) kernels pop.
3. In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate quadruples, so \(4 \times 20 = 80\) kernels pop.
4. In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate halves, so \(\frac{80}{2} = 40\) kernels pop.

Now, let's add up all the kernels that popped:
\[ 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 \]

After the pan is taken off the heat, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop due to residual heat:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \]

So, the total number of kernels that popped is:
\[ 200 + 10 = 210 \]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of popcorn Garrett has to eat is:
\[ \boxed{210} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade, and each gallon requires 1 cup of lemon juice. So, he needs 4 cups of lemon juice in total.

He also needs to make an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart. This extra gallon also needs 1 cup of lemon juice.

So, the total lemon juice needed is:
\[ 4 \text{ cups} + 1 \text{ cup} = 5 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we know that 6 lemons can make 1 cup of lemon juice. So, to get 5 cups of lemon juice, we need:
\[ 5 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 30 \text{ lemons} \]

Therefore, Tim will need \(\boxed{30}\) lemons."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs. Each German Shepherd eats 5 kilograms of dog food a day, and each Bulldog eats 3 kilograms of dog food a day.

First, let's calculate how much dog food the German Shepherds eat in a day:
- 3 German Shepherds × 5 kg/German Shepherd = 15 kg

Next, let's calculate how much dog food the Bulldogs eat in a day:
- 2 Bulldogs × 3 kg/Bulldog = 6 kg

Now, let's add the daily amounts together to find out how much dog food they eat in a day in total:
- 15 kg (German Shepherds) + 6 kg (Bulldogs) = 21 kg

To find out how much dog food they need for a week, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):
- 21 kg/day × 7 days/week = 147 kg

So, they will need 147 kilograms of dog food in a week. The correct answer is 147 kg."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

We have 10 animals that are 2-legged and 15 animals that are 4-legged. 

First, let's calculate the total number of legs:
- For the 2-legged animals: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) legs.
- For the 4-legged animals: \(15 \times 4 = 60\) legs.

Now, let's add these together to get the total number of legs:
- Total legs = \(20 + 60 = 80\) legs.

To find out how many pairs of legs there are, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
- Pairs of legs = \(80 \div 2 = 40\) pairs.

So, the total number of pairs of animal legs on the farm is 40. 

The final answer is \(\boxed{40}\)."

"To find out how far Elvis is from his house, we need to calculate the total distance he traveled in each direction and then find the net distance.

First, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
- He drove west for 5 hours at a speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Next, let's calculate the distance Elvis traveled east:
- He drove east for 8 hours at a speed of 18 mph.
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Now, we need to find the net distance from his starting point. Since he traveled west first and then east, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
- Net distance = Distance east - Distance west
- Net distance = 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles

So, Elvis is 54 miles from his house now.

The final answer is: 54 miles."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much the boat is worth after three years of depreciation.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat originally costs $9000. It loses 30% of its value in the first year.
   \[
   9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   So, after the first year, the boat is worth:
   \[
   9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   In the second year, the boat loses another 30% of its value, but this time it's based on the new value of $6300.
   \[
   6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   So, after the second year, the boat is worth:
   \[
   6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   In the third year, the boat loses 20% of its value based on the new value of $4410.
   \[
   4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   So, after the third year, the boat is worth:
   \[
   4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Therefore, the boat is worth \(\boxed{3528}\) dollars after three years."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know the total number of candies in the bag is 232. We also know there are 54 red candies. The number of orange candies is twice the number of red candies, so that's 2 * 54 = 108 orange candies. The number of yellow candies is half the number of red candies, so that's 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.

Now, let's add up the red, orange, and yellow candies:
54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189 candies.

To find out how many pink candies there are, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
232 (total) - 189 (red, orange, yellow) = 43 pink candies.

So, the number of pink candies is 43."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Helen stayed in a hotel for 3 nights. Each night costs $80. So, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \]

Next, we need to find out how much each bus trip costs. The problem says each bus trip is 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. So, each bus trip costs:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \]

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:
\[ 7 \times 8 = 56 \]

Now, we add the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips to find the total amount Helen paid:
\[ 240 + 56 = 296 \]

So, the total amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels is $296. 

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"

Mazie started with 52 marbles. After Dallas dropped 4 marbles, he had 17 marbles left. So, the total number of marbles given to both Dallas and Darla is:
\[ 52 - 17 = 35 \]

Dallas got 17 marbles, so Darla must have gotten the rest. To find out how many marbles Darla got, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas got from the total number of marbles given away:
\[ 35 - 17 = 18 \]

So, Darla got 18 marbles. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{18} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find the total cost.

First, we calculate the cost of the tickets:
- There are 2 adults, and each adult ticket costs $12. So, the total cost for the adult tickets is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dollars.
- There is 1 child, and each child ticket costs $8. So, the total cost for the child ticket is \(1 \times 8 = 8\) dollars.

Next, we calculate the cost of the popcorns:
- They buy 2 popcorns, and each popcorn costs $3. So, the total cost for the popcorns is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total amount they pay:
- Total cost = Cost of adult tickets + Cost of child ticket + Cost of popcorns
- Total cost = \(24 + 8 + 6 = 38\) dollars.

So, the total amount they pay is \(\boxed{38}\) dollars."

"Okay, let me break it down for you in a simpler way.

Avery needs a 3-piece place setting for her holiday dinner. Each setting includes a dinner plate, a salad plate, and a bowl. She's having 12 people over, so she needs 12 of these place settings.

- The dinner plate costs $6.00 each.
- The salad plate costs $4.00 each.
- The bowl costs $5.00 each.

First, let's find out how much one place setting costs:
- Dinner plate: $6.00
- Salad plate: $4.00
- Bowl: $5.00

Adding these together:
\[ 6.00 + 4.00 + 5.00 = 15.00 \]

So, one place setting costs $15.00.

Now, since Avery needs 12 of these place settings, we multiply the cost of one place setting by 12:
\[ 15.00 \times 12 = 180.00 \]

Therefore, Avery will spend $180.00 on place settings.

The final answer is: \boxed{180.00}"

Dexter has 5 pigs, and each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day. So, each pig eats:
\[ 4 \text{ pounds/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 8 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Now, for 5 pigs:
\[ 8 \text{ pounds/day/pig} \times 5 \text{ pigs} = 40 \text{ pounds/day} \]

This is the total amount of feed the pigs eat in one day. Now, we need to find out how much feed they eat in a week (7 days):
\[ 40 \text{ pounds/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 280 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed. So, the amount of feed left after a week is:

John invited 20 people to a party, and each person will eat 2 hot dogs. So, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
\[ 20 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs/person} = 40 \text{ hot dogs} \]

John already has 4 hot dogs from a previous party. So, he needs to buy:
\[ 40 \text{ hot dogs} - 4 \text{ hot dogs} = 36 \text{ hot dogs} \]

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2. To find out how many packs he needs to buy, we divide the number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs in each pack:
\[ \frac{36 \text{ hot dogs}}{6 \text{ hot dogs/pack}} = 6 \text{ packs} \]

Since each pack costs $2, the total cost is:
\[ 6 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pack} = 12 \text{ dollars} \]

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs. The correct answer is:

\[ 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount of money Frances has left is:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars} \]

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"Okay, let's go through the problem step by step:

1. On the first street, there are 5 children.
2. On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child. So, the number of children becomes \(5 + 5 = 10\).
3. On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by another 2 children. So, the number of children becomes \(10 + (10 \times 2) = 10 + 20 = 30\).

By the time the truck reaches the end of the third street, there are 30 children following it. Then, the original 5 children give up and leave the group. So, the number of children remaining is \(30 - 5 = 25\).

Therefore, the number of children now following the truck is 25.

The final answer is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Mamou was supposed to give out 1,360 meals. She gave out meals on three days: Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

- On Friday, she gave out 64 meals.
- On Saturday, she gave out 30 meals.
- On Sunday, she gave out 48 meals.

First, we need to find out how many meals she gave out in total over these three days. We add the meals given out each day:

64 (Friday) + 30 (Saturday) + 48 (Sunday) = 142 meals

Now, we subtract the total number of meals given out from the total number of meals she was supposed to give out:

1,360 (total meals) - 142 (meals given out) = 1,218 meals

So, the number of meals left to distribute is 1,218.

The correct answer is 1,218 meals."
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

James finds:
- 1 quarter, which is 25 cents.
- 2 nickels, and each nickel is 5 cents, so 2 nickels are 2 times 5 cents, which is 10 cents.
- 7 dimes, and each dime is 10 cents, so 7 dimes are 7 times 10 cents, which is 70 cents.

Now, we add all these up:
- 25 cents (quarters) + 10 cents (nickels) + 70 cents (dimes) = 105 cents.

So, James has 105 cents. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{105}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We have 2 brothers and 3 sisters. The sisters are all 16 years old, so their total age is:
\[ 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ years} \]

One of the brothers is 12 years old. The older brother is twice that age, so he is:
\[ 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ years old} \]

Now, we add the ages of the brothers:
\[ 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ years} \]

To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the total age of the sisters and the total age of the brothers:
\[ 48 + 36 = 84 \text{ years} \]

So, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]"
"Okay, let me explain it in a simpler way.

Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night. So, she meditates for a total of 30 minutes each day. She does this 5 days a week. So, in one week, she spends 30 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 150 minutes on meditation.

Now, she also does yoga for 1 hour (which is 60 minutes) every day. She does yoga 5 days a week, so in one week, she spends 60 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 300 minutes on yoga.

Over 4 weeks, she spends 150 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 600 minutes on meditation and 300 minutes/week * 4 weeks = 1200 minutes on yoga.

So, the total time she spends on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks is 600 minutes + 1200 minutes = 1800 minutes.

To convert 1800 minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
\[ 1800 \text{ minutes} / 60 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

So, the total time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga over 4 weeks is 30 hours. The correct answer is 30 hours."
"To find out the total square footage of the quilt, we need to add up the square footage from all the t-shirts Octavia is using.

First, let's calculate the square footage from the small t-shirts:
- Each small t-shirt is 3 square feet.
- Octavia uses 11 small t-shirts.
- So, the total square footage from small t-shirts is \(11 \times 3 = 33\) square feet.

Next, let's calculate the square footage from the medium t-shirts:
- Each medium t-shirt is 4 square feet.
- Octavia uses 8 medium t-shirts.
- So, the total square footage from medium t-shirts is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square feet.

Then, let's calculate the square footage from the large t-shirts:
- Each large t-shirt is 6 square feet.
- Octavia uses 6 large t-shirts.
- So, the total square footage from large t-shirts is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) square feet.

Now, we add up all these square footages to get the total square footage of the quilt:
\[33 + 32 + 36 = 101\]

So, the total square footage of the quilt is 101 square feet.

The final answer is: 101 square feet."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen is 12, a small sunflower has:

\[ 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds} \]

A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find out how many more seeds that is, we calculate 50% of 36:

\[ 0.50 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds} \]

So, a large sunflower has:

\[ 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds} \]

Now, to find the total number of seeds in both a small and a large sunflower, we add the seeds together:

\[ 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds} \]

So, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is 90."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know George has 18 pens. According to the problem, Timothy has three times the number of pens George has. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times 18 = 54
\]

Next, Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. So, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

Therefore, Sarah has 27 pens. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. Albert is 36 inches tall.
2. Anne is twice as tall as Albert, so Anne is \(2 \times 36 = 72\) inches tall.
3. Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie is \(72 - 2 = 70\) inches tall now.
4. Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer to reach 70 inches, so before the summer, she was \(70 - 3 = 67\) inches tall.

Therefore, Jackie's height before the summer was 67 inches. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{67} \]"
"To find out how much money the company will make from selling chocolate bars in two weeks, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know the company makes 5000 chocolate bars each day. In one week, which has 7 days, they make:
\[ 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35000 \text{ bars/week} \]

Now, for two weeks, they will make:
\[ 35000 \text{ bars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 70000 \text{ bars} \]

Since they sell each bar for $2, the total money they will make is:
\[ 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the company will receive $140000 for selling the chocolate bars in two weeks. The final answer is $140000."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Jake buys 2 T-shirts, and the original price of each T-shirt is $8. Since there's a ""buy one get one 50% off"" deal, the first T-shirt costs $8 and the second T-shirt costs $8 * 0.5 = $4. So, the total cost for the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. A 40% discount means Jake pays 60% of the original price. So, the discounted price of the shoes is $40 * 0.6 = $24.

Now, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount Jake spends. The total amount spent is $12 + $24 = $36.

So, the total amount of money Jake spends at the store is $36."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Ryan earns $6 for each week he does his chores. If he does his chores for 3 weeks, he earns:
\[ 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars} \]

He then buys ice cream cones. He buys one for himself and three for his friends, so that's:
\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \text{ ice cream cones} \]
Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for the ice cream cones is:
\[ 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars} \]

After buying the ice cream cones, the money he has left is:
\[ 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, Ryan wants to buy movie tickets. Each movie ticket costs $6.50. To find out how many movie tickets he can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of one movie ticket:
\[ \frac{13}{6.5} = 2 \]

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we calculate how much Ellen spent:
- Ellen bought leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5.
- So, Ellen's total is $100 + $5 = $105.

Next, we calculate how much Lani spent:
- Lani bought sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes, each costing $100.
- So, the cost of the two bathrobes is $100 * 2 = $200.
- Adding the cost of the sunglasses, Lani's total is $30 + $200 = $230.

Now, we add the totals for Ellen and Lani to find the total amount spent:
- Ellen's total is $105.
- Lani's total is $230.
- So, the total amount spent is $105 + $230 = $335.

Therefore, the total amount they spent in all is $335."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step to find out how much profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of his honey and jam mix.

First, we need to calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar:
- Passion fruit: 2 pounds at $6 per pound = 2 * 6 = $12
- Jackfruit: 1.5 pounds at $8 per pound = 1.5 * 8 = $12
- Special honey: 2 pounds at $10 per pound = 2 * 10 = $20

Now, we add up the costs of these ingredients for one jar:
$12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44

So, it costs Tim $44 to make one jar of the mix. For 10 jars, the total cost would be:
$44 * 10 = $440

Tim sells each jar for $50. So, the total revenue from selling 10 jars would be:
$50 * 10 = $500

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:
$500 (revenue) - $440 (cost) = $60

Therefore, the profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars is $60."
"To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then add these values together.

First, let's calculate the value of each type of coin:

- **Quarters:** Justin has 32 quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25. So, the total value of the quarters is \(32 \times 0.25 = 8\) dollars.
- **Dimes:** Justin has 95 dimes. Each dime is worth $0.10. So, the total value of the dimes is \(95 \times 0.10 = 9.50\) dollars.
- **Nickels:** Justin has 120 nickels. Each nickel is worth $0.05. So, the total value of the nickels is \(120 \times 0.05 = 6\) dollars.
- **Pennies:** Justin has 750 pennies. Each penny is worth $0.01. So, the total value of the pennies is \(750 \times 0.01 = 7.50\) dollars.

Now, we add up the values of all the coins:
\[8 + 9.50 + 6 + 7.50 = 31.00\]

So, the total dollar amount in the jar is \(\boxed{31.00}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

Janet spent money on three things:
1. Ice cream: $3.50
2. Movie tickets: $7.50 each for herself and her sister, so that's $7.50 * 2 = $15.00
3. A bracelet: $8.50

Now, let's add up all the money she spent:
\[ 3.50 + 15.00 + 8.50 = 27.00 \]

Janet's parents gave her $40. To find out how much she has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from $40:
\[ 40.00 - 27.00 = 13.00 \]

So, Janet has $13.00 left. 

The final answer is: **$13.00**"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Josh works 5 days a week because he doesn't work on Sunday and Wednesday. He services 3 cars each day he works. So, in one week, he services:
\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 15 \text{ cars/week} \]

He gets paid $4 for each car he services. So, his weekly earnings are:
\[ 15 \text{ cars/week} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Now, we need to find out how much he makes in 2 weeks:
\[ 60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

So, the amount Josh makes in 2 weeks is $120. The correct answer is:

"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. He wants to sell them to a buyer who will pay $5 for half of them and $7 for the other half.

First, we need to find out how many toy soldiers are in each half. Since he has 12 toy soldiers, half of that is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
So, he has 6 toy soldiers that will be sold for $5 each and 6 toy soldiers that will be sold for $7 each.

Now, let's calculate how much he will earn from each half:
- For the 6 toy soldiers sold at $5 each:
  \[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]
- For the 6 toy soldiers sold at $7 each:
  \[ 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Now, we add these two amounts together to find the total money he will earn:
\[ 30 + 42 = 72 \]

So, Matthew will earn $72. The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{72}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

First, we need to find out how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so:
\[ 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes} \]

When Nate is not there, the dog digs 6 holes a day, but Nate fills 9 holes a day. So, the net effect is:
\[ 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day} \]

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take to fill 84 holes at a rate of 3 holes per day:
\[ \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days} \]

Since there are 7 days in a week, we convert 28 days into weeks:
\[ \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks} \]

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Norman High School has an average of 4000 students. Butler High School has an average of \(\frac{3}{4}\) as many students as Norman High School. So, we need to find out how many students Butler High School has.

First, we calculate the number of students at Butler High School:
\[
\text{Students at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
\]

Now, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School. We do this by subtracting the number of students at Butler High School from the number of students at Norman High School:
\[
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
\]

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1000}

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we need to subtract the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies from the total number of cookies.

The total number of cookies made is 7995. The number of rainbow cookies is 2595, and the number of oatmeal cookies is 3075.

First, we add the number of rainbow cookies and oatmeal cookies:
\[ 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies to find the number of chocolate chip cookies:
\[ 7995 - 5670 = 2325 \]

So, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325.

The final numerical answer is:

"Let's go through the problem step by step to find out how many beakers Igor lost.

First, we know Dr. Grumpus asked for:
- 16 test tubes
- 7 beakers
- 14 Petri dishes

Igor gathered:
- Half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) test tubes.
- Two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) Petri dishes.
- The correct number of beakers, which is 7.

Now, let's add up all the items Igor gathered:
- Test tubes: 8
- Beakers: 7
- Petri dishes: 16

So, the total number of items Igor gathered is \( 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 \).

Dr. Grumpus asked for a total of \( 16 + 7 + 14 = 37 \) items.

Since Igor gathered 31 items, he must have lost \( 37 - 31 = 6 \) items in total.

We know Igor gathered 7 beakers, so the number of beakers he lost is 1 because he lost a total of 6 items.

Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

James is making 4 tables, and each table has 4 legs. So, for 4 tables, he needs:
\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs/table} = 16 \text{ legs} \]

Each leg needs 2 screws, so for 16 legs, he needs:
\[ 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left, we subtract the screws he needs from the screws he has:
\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

So, James will have 8 screws left over. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that the first basket has 10 eggs. The second basket has twice as many eggs as the first one, so we calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:

\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

Now, to find out how many eggs are in both baskets together, we add the number of eggs in the first basket to the number of eggs in the second basket:

\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \]

So, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, we know Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
\[ 430 + 320 = 750 \]
Kim raised $750.

Next, Sarah raised $300.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
\[ 300 + 400 = 700 \]
Maryam raised $700.

Now, we add up all the amounts they raised:
\[ 430 + 750 + 300 + 700 = 2180 \]

So, the total amount of money they raised is $2180.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2180}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

We know that Aaron ran 4 miles in 16 minutes. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can figure out how fast Vanessa runs.

If Aaron runs 4 miles in 16 minutes, then his speed is:
\[ \text{Aaron's speed} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{4 \text{ minutes}} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is:
\[ \text{Vanessa's speed} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{2 \times 4 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}} \]

Now, we need to find out how long it takes Vanessa to run 4 miles at this speed. We use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the values for Vanessa:
\[ \text{Time Vanessa took} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1 \text{ mile}}{8 \text{ minutes}}} = 4 \times 8 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Right now, there are 200 feet of dock, so he needs:
\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

But he already has 6 feet of new line. So, the line he still needs to buy is:
\[ 600 \text{ feet} - 6 \text{ feet} = 594 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{594} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step in a simpler way.

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations each night. They order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine for each reservation. So, the cost for each reservation is:

\[ 2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars} \]

They are open 2 days a week, so the number of reservations they get in a week is:

\[ 6 \text{ reservations/night} \times 2 \text{ nights/week} = 12 \text{ reservations/week} \]

Now, to find out how much they make in a week, we multiply the number of reservations by the cost per reservation:

\[ 12 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 180 \text{ dollars/week} \]

So, the amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:

\[
\boxed{180}
\]"
"Okay, let me explain it step by step in a simpler way.

The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He made a profit of 25% on this cost. First, we need to find out how much profit he made. To do this, we calculate 25% of $80:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 80 = \frac{25}{100} \times 80 = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \]

So, the profit he made is $20. Now, to find the total selling price, we add the profit to the cost price:

\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 80 + 20 = 100 \]

The vendor sold all 50 watermelons for a total of $100. To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:

\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

So, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Okay, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know James is currently 18 years old because he is twice as old as his sister Dora, and Dora is 9 years old.
2. Since James is 18 and he is 19 years older than his father John, John must be \(18 - 19 = -1\) years old, which doesn't make sense. So, let's correct this. If James is 19 years older than John, and James is 18, then John must be \(18 - 19 = -1\) years old, but since we know John was 19 when James was born, we can infer that John is 18 years older than James, so John is \(18 + 19 = 37\) years old.
3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.
4. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

So, the youngest son will be 8 years old in 3 years. The final answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in one hour.

First, let's determine how many oranges each can peel in one minute:
- Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{3} \) of an orange.
- Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange, so in one minute, she peels \( \frac{1}{4} \) of an orange.

Next, we calculate how many oranges each can peel in 60 minutes (one hour):
- In 60 minutes, Ana peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) oranges.
- In 60 minutes, Jane peels \( 60 \times \frac{1}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Now, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
- The difference is \( 20 - 15 = 5 \).

So, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The answer is 5.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

The original cost of a new radiator is $400. Mark gets it at 80% off, so he only pays 20% of the original cost. 

To find out how much he pays for the radiator:
\[ 400 \times 0.20 = 80 \]

So, the radiator costs him $80.

Next, he hires a mechanic to install the radiator. The mechanic charges $50 per hour and it takes 3 hours to install it. So, the cost for the mechanic is:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Now, we add the cost of the radiator to the cost of the mechanic:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

So, the total amount Mark paid is $230.

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

We know there are 20 animals in total, and they have 70 legs altogether. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each.

First, let's think about the total number of legs. If all 20 animals were cows, they would have \(20 \times 4 = 80\) legs. But we only have 70 legs, so there must be some chickens in there.

Let's say the number of chickens is \(C\) and the number of cows is \(K\). We know:
\[C + K = 20\]
\[2C + 4K = 70\]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[C + 2K = 35\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(C + K = 20\)
2. \(C + 2K = 35\)

To find \(K\), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[(C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20\]
\[K = 15\]

So, there are 15 cows. Now we can find the number of chickens by substituting \(K = 15\) back into the first equation:
\[C + 15 = 20\]
\[C = 5\]

Therefore, the number of chickens is 5."
"Okay, let's break it down step by step.

Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people. They ordered 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices. So, we first find out how many slices there are in total:

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Now, we need to share these 56 slices equally among the 4 people. So, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people:

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
