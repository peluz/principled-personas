"To determine how much Janet makes at the farmers' market each day, we start by calculating the total number of eggs laid by her ducks, which is 16 eggs per day. 

Next, we subtract the eggs she eats for breakfast, which is 3 eggs. This leaves us with:
\[ 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Then, we subtract the eggs she uses to bake muffins, which is 4 eggs. This leaves us with:
\[ 13 - 4 = 9 \]

Finally, since she sells each remaining egg for $2, the total amount she makes is:
\[ 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Therefore, Janet makes \(\boxed{18}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"To determine the total number of bolts of fiber needed for the robe, we need to calculate the amount of each type of fiber required and then sum them up using basic arithmetic operations.

1. **Blue Fiber:**
   - The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. **White Fiber:**
   - The robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.
   - Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
     \]

3. **Total Bolts of Fiber:**
   - Sum the bolts of blue and white fiber:
     \[
     2 \text{ bolts (blue)} + 1 \text{ bolt (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
     \]

Thus, the total number of bolts of fiber needed is:
\[
\boxed{3}

"Josh decides to flip a house by purchasing it for $80,000 and then spending an additional $50,000 on repairs. The total cost before the increase in value is $130,000. The repairs and subsequent work increase the value of the house by 150%. To find the new value of the house, we calculate 150% of $130,000 and add it to the total cost:

\[ 150\% \text{ of } 130,000 = 1.5 \times 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Adding this increase to the total cost gives the new value of the house:
\[ 130,000 + 195,000 = 325,000 \]

To find the profit, we subtract the original cost of the house from the new value:
\[ 325,000 - 130,000 = 195,000 \]

Therefore, the profit Josh made is:
\[ \boxed{195000} \]"
"To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we start by calculating the distance he covers in one session. Since he runs 3 sprints each time and each sprint is 60 meters, the distance for one session is:

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To calculate the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure: the first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of $5.

First, let's determine the cost for every second glass:
- The first glass costs $5.
- The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
- The third glass costs $5.
- The fourth glass costs 60% of $5, which is \(0.60 \times 5 = 3\) dollars.
- This pattern continues for every second glass.

For every pair of glasses, the cost is $5 + $3 = $8. Since Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, we can group them into 8 pairs (since 16 divided by 2 is 8).

The total cost for 8 pairs of glasses is:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, the total amount Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses is \(\boxed{64}\)."
"To find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start with the given information:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, which means Charleston has \(4 \times 20 = 80\) sheep.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, which means Toulouse has \(2 \times 80 = 160\) sheep.

To find the total number of sheep, we add the number of sheep in each city:
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep in Seattle} + \text{Sheep in Charleston} + \text{Sheep in Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
\]

Therefore, the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together is \(\boxed{260}\)."
"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into parts and calculate the time for each part.

1. **First 40% of the download:**
   - The file size is 200 GB.
   - 40% of 200 GB is \( 0.40 \times 200 = 80 \) GB.
   - At a rate of 2 GB/minute, the time to download 80 GB is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) minutes.

2. **Windows update and restart:**

"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Regular Hours:**
   - Eliza's regular rate is $10 per hour.
   - She worked 40 hours at this rate.
   - Earnings from regular hours = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime.
   - Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate.
   - Overtime rate = $10/hour * 1.2 = $12/hour.
   - Earnings from overtime = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.

3. **Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from regular hours + Earnings from overtime.
   - Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460.

Therefore, Eliza's total earnings for the week are $460."
"To determine the total number of downloads over the three months, we will calculate the downloads for each month step by step and then sum them up.

"To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year and find the point at which the profit becomes positive.

1. **Initial Cost**: The cost to plant the lemon tree is $90.
2. **Revenue per Year**: Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the revenue per year is:
   \[
   7 \text{ lemons/year} \times \$1.5 \text{ per lemon} = \$10.5 \text{ per year}
   \]
3. **Cost per Year**: The cost to water and feed the tree each year is $3.

The net profit per year is the revenue minus the cost:
\[
\$10.5 - \$3 = \$7.5 \text{ per year}
\]

Since the initial cost of $90 is a one-time expense, we need to determine how many years it will take for the net profit to cover this initial cost. We set up the equation:
\[
7.5 \times \text{number of years} = 90
\]

Solving for the number of years:
\[
\text{number of years} = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To solve this problem, let's work backwards from the information given.

1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house. Before selling at the orange house, she had twice this amount because she sold half of what was left:
   \[
   5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

2. Before selling 2 more at the red house, she had 10 vacuum cleaners. Adding these 2 back gives:
   \[
   10 + 2 = 12 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

3. Before selling a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, she had three times this amount because she sold a third of what was left:
   \[
   12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ vacuum cleaners}
   \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners. The final answer is:

3. Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will consume in 60 days.**

Cynthia eats 1 serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, in 60 days, she will eat:
\[ 60 \text{ servings} \]

**Step 2: Determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.**

Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons are needed for 60 servings, we divide the total servings by the servings per carton:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost based on the number of cartons.**

Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
\[ 4 \text{ cartons} \times 4 \text{ dollars/carton} = 16 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the total amount Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days is:
\[ \boxed{16} \]"
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we start with the total distance of his trip, which is 60 miles. 

First, we note the distance of his first stop, which is 20 miles. 

Next, we determine the distance of his second stop. Since his second stop is 15 miles before the end of the trip, we calculate it as follows: 
\[ 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles} \]

Now, to find the distance traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop:
\[ 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops is 25 miles. 

The correct answer is \(\boxed{25}\)."
"Gloria is shoe shopping when she comes across a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots?

Let's denote the cost of the boots as \( B \).

We know that the cost of one pair of high heels is $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, which means it costs \( 2 \times 33 = 66 \) dollars.

The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is \( 33 + 66 = 99 \) dollars.

According to the problem, the two pairs of high heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ B = 99 + 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( B \):

\[ B = 104 \]

So, the cost of the boots is \( 104 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{104} \]"
"Given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11 and their total age is 162, we can set up the following system of equations to find their individual ages:

Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\). The sum of their ages is given by:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[18x = 162\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

Now, we can find their ages:
- Darrell's age: \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\)
- Allen's age: \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is \(\boxed{109}\)."
"To find the average guess, we start by calculating each friend's guess based on the first friend's guess of 80 jelly beans.

1. The first friend's guess is 80 jelly beans.
2. The second friend's guess is 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. Half of 80 is 40, and adding 20 gives 60. So, the second friend's guess is 60 jelly beans.
3. The third friend's guess is 25% more than the first friend's guess. 25% of 80 is 20, and adding this to 80 gives 100. So, the third friend's guess is 100 jelly beans.

Now, we have the guesses: 80, 60, and 100. To find the average, we sum these guesses and divide by the number of guesses:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

Thus, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To find out how many hours a week John spends taking care of the dogs, we start by calculating the daily time spent. Each dog requires 0.5 hours a day, and John takes care of 10 dogs. Therefore, the total time spent per day is:

\[ 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many hours John spends in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily time by 7:

\[ 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \]

Thus, the total number of hours John spends taking care of the dogs in a week is:

\[
\boxed{35}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given information:
1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

Let \( S \) represent the number of silver coins and \( G \) represent the number of gold coins. We can set up the following system of equations based on the information provided:

\[
\begin{cases}
G = S + 30 \\
G + S = 110
\end{cases}
\]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

\[
(S + 30) + S = 110
\]

Simplifying this, we have:

\[
2S + 30 = 110
\]

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\[
2S = 80
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
S = 40
\]

Now, substituting \( S = 40 \) back into the first equation to find \( G \):

\[
G = 40 + 30 = 70
\]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \( 70 \)."
"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. Raymond has 40 jewels.
2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Therefore, we first calculate half of Raymond's jewels:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
3. Adding 5 to this amount gives us the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   20 + 5 = 25
   \]
4. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
   \[
   25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Thus, Siobhan has 23 jewels. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we start by calculating the points he scored in the second 20 minutes. Since he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes compared to the first 20 minutes, we first determine 25% of the 4 points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

1. Calculate 25% of 4 points:
   \[
   0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ point}
   \]

2. Add this additional point to the 4 points scored in the first 20 minutes:
   \[
   4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
   \]

3. Sum the points from both segments to find the total:
   \[
   4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is \(\boxed{9}\)."
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:**
   Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   \[
   \text{Total yogurts in 30 days} = 2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts}
   \]

2. **Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts are in 60 yogurts:**
   The yogurts are sold in sets of 4 for $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{60 \, \text{yogurts}}{4 \, \text{yogurts/set}} = 15 \, \text{sets}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 15 sets:**
   Each set costs $5.00.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15 \, \text{sets} \times 5 \, \text{\$/set} = 75 \, \text{\$}
   \]

Thus, Terry spends \(\boxed{75}\) dollars on yogurt over 30 days."
"John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and he sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many lego sets does he still have?

First, calculate the total amount of money John makes from selling his lego sets:
\[ 13 \text{ lego sets} \times 15 \text{ dollars per lego set} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, calculate the total amount of money John spends on the video games:
\[ 8 \text{ video games} \times 20 \text{ dollars per video game} = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, determine how much money John has left after buying the video games:
\[ 195 \text{ dollars} - 160 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars} \]

Since John has $5 left after spending $160 on video games, the $35 he has left is the amount he had initially, which is the total amount he made from selling his lego sets. Since he started with 13 lego sets and sold all of them, he still has 0 lego sets.

Therefore, the number of lego sets John still has is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]"
"To determine John's running speed, we start by calculating the distance he runs each day. Given that he runs a total of 60 miles in a week and runs 3 days a week, the distance he runs each day is:

\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ days}} = 20 \text{ miles/day} \]

Next, we need to find out how much he runs each of the other two days. He runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much on the other two days. So, the time he runs on the other two days is:

\[ \text{Time on other two days} = \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Now, we can calculate the total time John spends running in a week:

\[ \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find his running speed, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \]

Therefore, John's running speed is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the distances Dana can travel by running and walking within the given time frame, and then sum these distances to find the total distance she can travel in six hours.

First, we establish the speeds:
- Dana can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
- Since skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) miles per hour.
- Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, which is \(6 / 4 = 1.5\) miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the time spent on each activity:
- One-third of the six hours is spent running, which is \(2\) hours.
- Two-thirds of the six hours is spent walking, which is \(4\) hours.

Now, we calculate the distances:
- Distance traveled by running: \(6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}\).
- Distance traveled by walking: \(1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}\).

Finally, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is the sum of the distances traveled by running and walking:
\[ 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is \(\boxed{18}\) miles."
"To determine the age of Brandon's iPhone, we start with the information given:

2. Ben's iPhone is two times as old as Suzy's iPhone, so Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1 = 2\) years old.
3. Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone, so Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the age of Brandon's iPhone is 8 years."
"To determine how far outside the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the difference between the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone and the dragon's reach.

First, we know that Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone. When holding the gemstone, she can throw it three times farther:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} \times 3 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

The dragon's reach is 1000 feet. To find out how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the distance she can throw the javelin:
\[ 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{200} \]"
"Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, each cut into 8 pieces, making a total of 40 pieces. After the guests had their servings, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the remaining pieces from the total pieces:

Therefore, the number of pieces taken by the guests is:

\[ 26 \]"
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat given your daily calorie target and the calories already consumed, we start by calculating the calories per serving. A 300g bag containing 5 servings has 250 calories per serving.

Next, we find out how many calories you can still consume in a day. With a daily target of 2000 calories and having already consumed 1800 calories, the remaining calories are:

\[ 2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories} \]

Given that each serving contains 50 calories, the number of servings you can consume with the remaining 200 calories is:

\[ \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{50 \text{ calories per serving}} = 4 \text{ servings} \]

Since each serving is 50 grams, the total grams of chips you can eat is:

\[ 4 \text{ servings} \times 50 \text{ grams per serving} = 200 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"To determine Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles, we need to break down the costs and revenues step by step.

First, calculate the cost of making 20 candles:
- Charlie needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.
- The cost for 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks is $10.00.
- Therefore, the cost for 2 pounds of beeswax is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles:
- Each candle is sold for $2.00.
- Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is \(20 \times 2 = 40\) dollars.

Now, calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
- The total cost is $20.
- The total revenue is $40.
- The net profit is \(40 - 20 = 20\) dollars.

Thus, the net profit if Charlie makes and sells 20 candles is:

"To determine the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of articles written each day:**
   - **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
   - **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

2. **Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:**
   \[
   \text{Total articles} = 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles:**
   Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent is:

\[ x = 23 + 140 \]
\[ x = 163 \]

Therefore, the number of Post-it notes in the package that she purchased is:
\[ \boxed{163} \]"
"To determine the total amount John spent on ties, we start by calculating the number of blue ties he bought. Given that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent a total of $200 on blue ties, we can find the number of blue ties as follows:

\[
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
\]

Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties he buys is:

\[
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of each red tie. Given that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, the cost per red tie is:

\[
\text{Cost per red tie} = \text{Cost per blue tie} \times (1 + 0.50) = 40 \times 1.50 = 60
\]

Now, we find the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost per red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
\]

Finally, we calculate the total amount John spent on ties by adding the total cost of the blue ties and the total cost of the red ties:

\[
\text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total cost of blue ties} + \text{Total cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
\]

Therefore, the total amount John spent on ties is:

\[
\boxed{800}

"To determine how long it takes Tom to get back, we need to know the distance \( D \) he traveled to his destination. Given that he travels at 10 miles per hour to the destination and 6 miles per hour back, we can calculate the time for each leg of the trip.

First, the time to travel to the destination is:
\[ \text{Time to destination} = \frac{D}{10} \text{ hours} \]

Next, the time to travel back is:
\[ \text{Time to return} = \frac{D}{6} \text{ hours} \]

The total time for the round trip is the sum of these two times:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{D}{10} + \frac{D}{6} \]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 6 is 30. So we rewrite the fractions:
\[ \frac{D}{10} = \frac{3D}{30} \]
\[ \frac{D}{6} = \frac{5D}{30} \]

Adding these fractions gives:
\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{3D}{30} + \frac{5D}{30} = \frac{8D}{30} = \frac{4D}{15} \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the total time it takes Tom to get back is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{4D}{15}} \text{ hours} \]

If the distance \( D \) is provided, you can substitute it into this formula to get the specific numerical answer."
"Uriah's book bag is getting too heavy, and he needs to remove 15 pounds from it. He has comic books that weigh \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound each and toys that weigh \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound each. If he removes 30 comic books, we need to determine how many toys he needs to remove to meet his goal.

First, calculate the total weight of the 30 comic books:
\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Subtract this weight from the total weight he needs to remove:
\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, determine how many toys weigh 7.5 pounds. Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, so:
\[
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15 \text{ toys}
\]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to meet his goal. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}

"To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we start by calculating the number of kittens each cat has had.

1. **Patchy's Kittens:**
   - Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
   - The adopted kittens are 7.
   - Therefore, Patchy has had \(3 \times 7 = 21\) kittens.

2. **Trixie's Kittens:**
   - Trixie has had 12 kittens.

3. **Total Kittens:**
   - Add the number of adopted kittens to the number of kittens Patchy and Trixie have had.
   - Total kittens = Adopted kittens + Patchy's kittens + Trixie's kittens
   - Total kittens = 7 + 21 + 12

"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the maximum allowable weight of the boxes:**
   The bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. Therefore, the maximum weight that can be added to the truck (the weight of the boxes) is:
   \[
   5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of boxes that can be loaded:**
   Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded, we divide the maximum allowable weight of the boxes by the weight of one box:
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83

"To find the total number of raspberries, we start by calculating the total from the clusters and then add the individual raspberries.

First, we calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters:
\[ 6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ raspberries per cluster} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \]

Next, we add the 67 individual raspberries to the 120 raspberries from the clusters:
\[ 120 + 67 = 187 \]

Therefore, the total number of raspberries is:
\[ 187 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 187 \]"
"To determine the number of good oranges, we start with the total number of oranges, which is 25. We know that 1 orange is bad and 2 oranges are sour. Additionally, 20% of the oranges are unripe. Let's calculate the number of unripe oranges first:

1. Calculate the number of unripe oranges:
   \[
   \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]

Next, we subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges to find the number of good oranges:
\[
\text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) = 25 - 8 = 17
\]

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 17."
"To find the total amount Janet paid, we start by calculating the total cost of the brooch before insurance. This includes the cost of the material and the cost of construction:

- Cost of material = $500
- Cost of construction = $800

Adding these together gives the total cost before insurance:
\[ 500 + 800 = 1300 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of insurance, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:
\[ 10\% \text{ of } 1300 = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130 \]

Finally, we add the cost of insurance to the total cost before insurance to find the final amount Janet paid:
\[ 1300 + 130 = 1430 \]

Therefore, the total amount Janet paid is $1430."
"To determine Marcy's annual pension after 30 years, we need to break down the pension calculation into two periods: the first 20 years and the next 10 years.

1. **First 20 years:**
   - Marcy earns a fixed annual pension of $50,000 per year.
   - Therefore, for the first 20 years, her total pension is:
     \[
     20 \times 50,000 = 1,000,000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Next 10 years:**
   - Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
   - The value of the pension at the start of the 21st year is $1,000,000.
   - Therefore, her pension for the next 10 years is 5% of $1,000,000 per year:
     \[
     0.05 \times 1,000,000 = 50,000 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

3. **Total pension after 30 years:**
   - For the first 20 years, she earns $50,000 per year.
   - For the next 10 years, she earns $50,000 per year.
   - Therefore, her total annual pension after 30 years is:
     \[
     50,000 + 50,000 = 100,000 \text{ dollars per year}
     \]

Thus, Marcy's annual pension after 30 years is \(\boxed{100000}\)."
"To determine the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payments into two halves of the year and calculate the total cost.

1. **Calculate the cost for the first half of the year:**
   - There are 6 months in a half of the year.
   - The monthly charge is $140.
   - Therefore, the cost for the first half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 140 = 840 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost for the second half of the year:**
   - The second half of the year also has 6 months.
   - The charge for the second half is 10% less than the initial amount.
   - First, find 10% of $140:
     \[
     0.10 \times 140 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Subtract this 10% from the initial amount to get the reduced charge for the second half:
     \[
     140 - 14 = 126 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost for the second half of the year is:
     \[
     6 \times 126 = 756 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount paid for the entire year:**
   - Add the costs for the first and second halves of the year:
     \[
     840 + 756 = 1596 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Aleena had paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is:
\[
\boxed{1596}

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we start by calculating her car's fuel efficiency. She has traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas, so her car's miles per gallon (mpg) is:

\[ \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \]

Given that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, the total distance she can drive on a full tank is:

\[ \text{Distance on a full tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the number of miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas is:

\[ 300 \]"
"To determine the total hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we start by calculating the time spent in one session. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and 1 hour reading, which totals 3 hours per session. Since he repeats this 3 times a week, the weekly total is 9 hours. Over 4 weeks, this amounts to 36 hours. Thus, the total time Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 36 hours."
"To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we start by calculating the number of people sent by one school. Each school sends:

- 5 players from the girls' team
- 5 players from the boys' team
- 1 coach for the girls' team
- 1 coach for the boys' team

Adding these together, each school sends:
\[ 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 12 \text{ people} \]

Therefore, the total number of people sent by all the schools is 48."
"To find the total number of gems, we start by calculating the number of each type of gem:

- The number of diamonds is 175.
- The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the diamonds, so we calculate \(175 - 35 = 140\).
- The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so we calculate \(2 \times 140 = 280\).

Now, we sum the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds:
\[ 175 + 140 + 280 = 605 \]

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is \(\boxed{605}\)."
"To determine the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school, we start by analyzing the given information:

   - Given that there are 60 girls, the number of boys is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).

2. **Total Number of Students:**
   - The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls.
   - Total students = Number of boys + Number of girls = \(120 + 60 = 180\).

3. **Number of Teachers:**
   - There are 5 students to every teacher.
   - Therefore, the number of teachers is the total number of students divided by 5.
   - Number of teachers = \(\frac{180}{5} = 36\).

Thus, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is 36."
"To determine how much money Bailey started with, we need to account for the total amount she received from her weekly allowance and subtract it from her total amount at the end of 8 weeks.

Bailey receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, so the total allowance is:
\[ 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

At the end of 8 weeks, Bailey has a total of $100. Therefore, the amount of money she started with is:
\[ 100 - 40 = 60 \]

Thus, Bailey started with $60.

The final numerical answer is:

"To calculate Judy's earnings for the week, we'll break it down into two parts: her earnings from weekdays and her earnings from Saturday.

First, let's calculate her earnings from the weekdays:
- Judy teaches 5 classes each weekday, and there are 5 weekdays in a week.
- Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches in one weekday is:
\[ 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 75 \text{ students/day} \]

The total number of students she teaches in 5 weekdays is:
\[ 75 \text{ students/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 375 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from the weekdays are:
\[ 375 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$5625.00 \]

Next, let's calculate her earnings from Saturday:
- Judy teaches 8 classes on Saturday.
- Each class has 15 students, and she charges $15.00 per student.

The number of students she teaches on Saturday is:
\[ 8 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 120 \text{ students} \]

Her earnings from Saturday are:
\[ 120 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$1800.00 \]

Finally, her total earnings for the week are the sum of her earnings from the weekdays and Saturday:
\[ \$5625.00 + \$1800.00 = \$7425.00 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Judy makes in one week is:
\[ \boxed{7425} \]"
"To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, we start by noting the first recipe has 20 instructions. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has \(2 \times 20 = 40\) instructions. Adding these together, the total number of instructions is \(20 + 40 = 60\).

Therefore, the total number of instructions Kelian has to read is \(\boxed{60}\)."
"To calculate the total money Tommy raises, we start by determining the revenue from the brownies and the cheesecakes separately.

First, we calculate the revenue from the brownies:
- Tommy sells 43 brownies.
- Each brownie is sold for $3.

\[
\text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3 = 129 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the cheesecakes:
- Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake.
- Each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4.

\[
\text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4 = 92 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we sum the revenues from the brownies and the cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 129 + 92 = 221 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Tommy raises is \(\boxed{221}\)."
"To determine Shiela's monthly installment payment, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest:**
   Shiela bought five cell phones at $150 each.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total interest on the cell phones:**
   The interest rate is 2% per unit.
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 5 \times 150 \times 0.02 = 15 \text{ dollars}

\]

Thus, the total amount Artie will make is \(\boxed{88.00}\)."
"To find the average square footage of a level in Luke's 4 leveled sandcastle, we first need to determine the square footage of each level.

Given:
- The top level (level 4) has a square footage of 16.
- Each level below has half the square footage of the level above it.

Let's calculate the square footage for each level:

1. **Level 4 (top level):**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = 16
   \]

2. **Level 3:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

3. **Level 2:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]

4. **Level 1:**
   \[
   \text{Square footage} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we have the square footage for each level:
- Level 1: 2
- Level 2: 4
- Level 3: 8
- Level 4: 16

To find the average square footage of a level, we sum the square footages and divide by the number of levels:

\[
\text{Sum of square footages} = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 30
\]

\[
\text{Number of levels} = 4
\]

\[

"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the problem into manageable steps.

1. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:**
   - The puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day for the first 180 days.
   - Total dog food for the first 180 days = \( 1 \, \text{cup/day} \times 180 \, \text{days} = 180 \, \text{cups} \).

2. **Determine the remaining days in the first year:**
   - A year has 365 days.
   - Remaining days after the first 180 days = \( 365 \, \text{days} - 180 \, \text{days} = 185 \, \text{days} \).

3. **Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:**
   - The puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day for the remaining 185 days.
   - Total dog food for the remaining 185 days = \( 2 \, \text{cups/day} \times 185 \, \text{days} = 370 \, \text{cups} \).

4. **Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first year:**
   - Total dog food for the first year = \( 180 \, \text{cups} + 370 \, \text{cups} = 550 \, \text{cups} \).

5. **Determine the number of bags of dog food needed:**
   - Each bag contains 110 cups.
   - Number of bags needed = \( \frac{550 \, \text{cups}}{110 \, \text{cups/bag}} = 5 \, \text{bags} \).

Thus, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

"Given the problem, we start by determining the amount of laundry Sarah does, which is explicitly stated as 400 pounds.

Next, we calculate the amount of laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we divide 400 pounds by 4:

\[
\text{Laundry done by David} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we find out how much laundry Raymond does. Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so we divide 400 pounds by 2:

\[
\text{Laundry done by Raymond} = \frac{400 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

To find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does:

\[
\text{Difference} = 200 \text{ pounds} - 100 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 each versus buying them in packages of 2 for $1 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3:
- Each package of 3 flowers costs $2.50.
- To find out how many packages of 3 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 3:
  \[
  \frac{18}{3} = 6
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 6 packages of 3 flowers.
- The total cost for 6 packages of 3 flowers is:
  \[
  6 \times 2.50 = 15.00
  \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2:
- Each package of 2 flowers costs $1.
- To find out how many packages of 2 flowers are needed to get 18 flowers, we divide 18 by 2:
  \[
  \frac{18}{2} = 9
  \]
- Therefore, Vincent needs 9 packages of 2 flowers.
- The total cost for 9 packages of 2 flowers is:
  \[
  9 \times 1 = 9.00
  \]

Now, we compare the two costs:
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2: $9.00

Vincent saves more money by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2. The amount saved is:
\[
15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00
\]

Thus, the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is \(\boxed{6.00}\)."
"To find the cost of grooming after the discount, we start with the original cost of $100 and apply the 30% discount. 

First, calculate the discount amount:
\[ \text{Discount amount} = 100 \times \frac{30}{100} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30 \]

Next, subtract the discount amount from the original cost:
\[ \text{Cost after discount} = 100 - 30 = 70 \]

Therefore, the cost of grooming after the discount is $70.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{70} \]"
"To determine how much water was left after the girls and the boy received their portions, we start with the total amount of water, which is 24 liters.

First, we calculate the amount of water each girl received. Since each girl got \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the 24 liters, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
\]
Since there are two girls, the total amount of water they received together is:
\[
4 \text{ liters} + 4 \text{ liters} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we add the 6 liters of water that the boy received:
\[
8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

To find out how much water was left, we subtract the total amount of water taken by the girls and the boy from the initial amount:
\[
24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
\]

Therefore, the amount of water left is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]"
"Charlie started with 10 stickers. After buying 21 more and receiving 23 for his birthday, he had a total of 54 stickers. After giving 9 stickers to his sister, he had 45 stickers left. Finally, after using 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, he had 17 stickers remaining. 

Thus, the number of stickers Charlie has left is 17."
"To find Alex's weight, we start with Grace's weight of 125 pounds. Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times Grace's weight. First, we calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
\[ 4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract 2 pounds from 500 to find Alex's weight:
\[ 500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, to find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight:
\[ 125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds."
"To find the total number of thorns, we start by calculating the total number of roses. Dan plants 3 rose bushes, and each bush has 25 roses. Therefore, the total number of roses is:

\[ 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Next, we know that each rose has 8 thorns. To find the total number of thorns, we multiply the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

\[ 75 \times 8 = 600 \]

Thus, the total number of thorns is 600."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( L \) represent the number of games lost.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of games won.

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
1. The team played a total of 22 games.
2. They won 8 more games than they lost.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
\[ W + L = 22 \]
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Next, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

Now that we know the number of games lost (\( L = 7 \)), we can find the number of games won (\( W \)):
\[ W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15 \]

Therefore, the number of games the team won is 15."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we start by calculating the total number of vacations he has been on. Gene started vacationing at the age of 23 and is now 34 years old, so the total number of vacations is:

\[ 34 - 23 = 11 \text{ vacations} \]

Since each vacation is represented by one quilt block, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is:

\[ 11 \]

Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is \(\boxed{11}\)."
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang, we'll add the number of times it rang each time it went off.

1. The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
2. The second time, it rang for three times as long as the first time, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) times.
3. The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) times.

Now, we sum these up:
\[ 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 \]

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times."
"Certainly! Let's refine the process of calculating Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, focusing on the compounded increase due to the annual 10% raise.

1. **Initial Salary**: Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.

2. **Annual Salary Increase**: The company increases her salary by 10% each year for those who have served for five years.

3. **First Year Increase**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$600 = 0.10 \times 600 = \$60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$600 + \$60 = \$660
   \]

4. **Second Year Increase**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$660 = 0.10 \times 660 = \$66
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$660 + \$66 = \$726
   \]

5. **Third Year Increase**:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } \$726 = 0.10 \times 726 = \$72.60
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = \$726 + \$72.60 = \$798.60
   \]

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is \(\boxed{798.60}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information. Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald's record sold. According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, so Marilyn's record sold \( 10H \) copies. The total number of copies sold by both records combined is 88,000. This gives us the equation:

\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find \( H \), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]

\[ H = 8,000 \]

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 8000 \]"
"Christina invited 16 friends, and 1/4 of them don't show up, meaning 3/4 of the invited guests will attend. To find out how many guests will attend, we calculate:

\[ \text{Number of guests attending} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \]

Next, Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attending guest. Therefore, the total number of gift bags needed is:

\[ \text{Total gift bags needed} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \]

Since each gift bag costs $2, the total cost for the gift bags is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \]

Thus, Christina will spend **$18**."

- There are 20 adults at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
\]

Next, we calculate the potato salad consumption for the children:
- Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult, which is \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) lbs of potato salad.
- There are 5 children at the picnic.

\[
\text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
\]

Now, we sum the total potato salad needed for both the adults and the children:

\[
\text{Total potato salad} = 200 \text{ lbs} + 25 \text{ lbs} = 225 \text{ lbs}
\]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{225}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of pets each person has in terms of Cindy's pets. Given that Cindy has 4 pets, we can express the number of pets Marcia and Jan have based on this information.

1. Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy. Therefore, Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
2. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Therefore, Jan has \(3 \times 6 = 18\) pets.

Next, we calculate the total number of pets by summing the pets each person has:
\[
4 \text{ (Cindy's pets)} + 6 \text{ (Marcia's pets)} + 18 \text{ (Jan's pets)} = 28
\]

Thus, the total number of pets the three have is \(\boxed{28}\)."
"To solve the problem systematically, let's define the ages of the kids using variables:
- Let \( J \) be Jackson's age.
- Let \( A \) be Amy's age.
- Let \( C \) be Corey's age.
- Let \( Jm \) be James's age.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \).
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Corey: \( A = C - 2 \).
3. James is 10 years old and 1 year younger than Corey: \( Jm = 10 \) and \( C = Jm + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \).
4. James is 1 year younger than Corey, so \( Jm = C - 1 \).

First, we confirm the value of Corey's age:
\[ C = Jm + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Next, we use the relationship between Amy and Jackson:
\[ A = J + 5 \]
And the relationship between Amy and Corey:
\[ A = C - 2 \]
Since \( C = 11 \):
\[ A = 11 - 2 = 9 \]

Now, we substitute \( A = 9 \) into the equation \( A = J + 5 \):
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 9 - 5 = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]"
"To determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lee's original time:**
   Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

2. **Calculate Lee's original speed:**
   Lee's speed \( S_L \) is:
   \[
   S_L = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{38 \text{ seconds}} \approx 10.53 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

3. **Determine Gerald's original time:**
   Since Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald's original time \( T_G \) is:
   \[
   T_G = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Calculate Gerald's original speed:**
   Gerald's speed \( S_G \) is:
   \[
   S_G = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{40 \text{ seconds}} = 10 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

5. **Calculate Gerald's improved speed:**
   With a 10% improvement, Gerald's improved speed \( S_G' \) is:
   \[
   S_G' = 10 \text{ meters/second} + 0.10 \times 10 \text{ meters/second} = 10 \text{ meters/second} + 1 \text{ meter/second} = 11 \text{ meters/second}
   \]

6. **Determine Gerald's improved time:**
   Using his improved speed, Gerald's improved time \( T_G' \) is:
   \[
   T_G' = \frac{400 \text{ meters}}{11 \text{ meters/second}} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 36.36 seconds.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36.36}

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( D \) represent the number of dogs.
- Let \( C \) represent the number of cats.
- Let \( R \) represent the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The number of dogs \( D = 60 \).
2. The number of cats \( C \) is two times the number of dogs, so \( C = 2D \).
3. The number of rabbits \( R \) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats, so \( R = D + C - 12 \).

First, we calculate the number of cats:
\[ C = 2D = 2 \times 60 = 120 \]

Next, we calculate the number of rabbits:
\[ R = D + C - 12 = 60 + 120 - 12 = 168 \]

Now, we find the total number of pets in the neighborhood by summing the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = D + C + R = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348 \]

Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is \( 348 \)."
"To determine the number of girls not in the girl scout, we start by calculating the number of girls in the class. Given that 2/5 of the 200 students are boys, the number of girls is:

\[ 200 - \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 200\right) = 200 - 80 = 120 \]

Next, we find out how many of these girls are in the girl scout. Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \]

To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

\[ 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, the number of girls not in the girl scout is:

\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we start by noting that Harry slept 9 hours. James slept \(\frac{2}{3}\) of what Harry slept. Therefore, we calculate the hours James slept as follows:

\[
\text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we find the difference in the hours slept between Harry and James:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. The final numerical answer is:

3"
"To determine the number of tomatoes Freda used, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the volume of tomatoes before cooking:**
   - Freda's last batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces.
   - Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the original volume of tomatoes before cooking is twice the volume of the sauce:
     \[
     \text{Original volume of tomatoes} = 32 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 64 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Determine the volume of tomatoes per can:**
   - Each can of tomatoes contains 16 ounces.

3. **Calculate the number of cans of tomatoes used:**
   - Since the original volume of tomatoes is 64 ounces and each can contains 16 ounces, the number of cans used is:
     \[
     \text{Number of cans} = \frac{64 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/can}} = 4 \text{ cans}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of tomatoes per can:**
   - Each can contains 3 tomatoes.

5. **Calculate the total number of tomatoes used:**
   - Since 4 cans were used and each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes is:
     \[
     \text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \text{ cans} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

Thus, the total number of tomatoes Freda used is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Setup**: We start with 30 cars on the motorway.
2. **Cars Driven Through**: In the first 15 minutes, \( x \) cars drive through the traffic jam.
3. **Additional Cars**: In the next 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through the traffic jam.
4. **Cars Exiting**: 5 cars exit the motorway, avoiding the traffic jam.
5. **Remaining Cars**: After the traffic jam, the number of cars remaining on the motorway is 5.

We can set up the equation based on the remaining cars:
\[ \text{Initial Cars} - \text{Cars Driven Through} - \text{Additional Cars} - \text{Cars Exiting} = \text{Remaining Cars} \]
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = 5 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 30 - x - 20 - 5 = 5 \]
\[ 30 - x - 25 = 5 \]
\[ 5 - x = 5 \]
\[ x = 0 \]

However, this result doesn't align with the problem's context. Let's re-evaluate the setup:

The correct setup should be:
\[ 30 - (x + 20) = 5 \]
\[ 30 - x - 20 = 5 \]
\[ 10 - x = 5 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( x = 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Mary initially has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, which totals to:

\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

She then receives 18 new potted plants:

\[ 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges, which amounts to:

\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Subtracting the plants given away from the total:

\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Therefore, the number of potted plants Mary will remain with is:

\[ \boxed{58} \]"
"To find the total number of doorbell rings pressed by Jerome's friends, we will calculate the number of rings each friend pressed and then sum them up.

1. **First Friend**: The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
   \[
   \text{First friend's doorbell rings} = 20
   \]

2. **Second Friend**: The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. This means the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) times.
   \[
   \text{Second friend's doorbell rings} = 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Fourth Friend**: The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
   \[
   \text{Fourth friend's doorbell rings} = 60
   \]

4. **Third Friend**: The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. This means the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 times.
   \[
   \text{Third friend's doorbell rings} = 60 + 10 = 70
   \]

Now, we sum up all the doorbell rings:
\[
\text{Total doorbell rings} = 20 + 25 + 60 + 70
\]

Calculating the total:
\[
20 + 25 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 60 = 105
\]
\[
105 + 70 = 175
\]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings is:
\[
\boxed{175}

"To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average in one day over the remaining 4 days, we start by calculating the total number of pages he needs to read:

- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

Adding these together gives:
\[ 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 \text{ pages} \]

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, the remaining pages he needs to read are:
\[ 39 - 15 = 24 \text{ pages} \]

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average in one day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:
\[ \frac{24 \text{ pages}}{4 \text{ days}} = 6 \text{ pages per day} \]

Thus, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day for the remaining 4 days. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we'll calculate his water consumption by considering both weekdays and weekends separately.

First, let's calculate the water consumption for a single weekday:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with breakfast.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with lunch.
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.
- John drinks 1 glass of water before bed.

So, on a weekday, John drinks:
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water} \]

Since there are 5 weekdays in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekdays is:
\[ 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses} \]

Next, let's calculate the water consumption for a single weekend day:
- John drinks 1 glass of water with dinner.

So, on a weekend day, John drinks:
\[ 1 \text{ glass of water} \]

Since there are 2 weekend days in a week, the total number of glasses of water John drinks on weekends is:
\[ 1 \text{ glass/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ glasses} \]

Now, we add the total glasses of water consumed on weekdays and weekends to find the total for the entire week:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses} + 2 \text{ glasses} = 22 \text{ glasses} \]

Therefore, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:

"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday.

From the problem, we know:
- On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 1 hour each day, which totals 2 hours.
- On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is 1.5 hours.
- On Friday, he watched 2 hours.
- The total time spent watching TV is 7 hours.

The equation for the total time spent watching TV is:

"To determine how many cookies Henry baked last year, we start by setting up the equation based on the information provided. Henry intended to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, which we denote as \( x \). Therefore, he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies. However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, making the total number of cookies he baked \( 2x + 15 \).

After baking, Henry drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \). According to the problem, this final count is 110 cookies. Thus, we set up the equation:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation step by step:
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 110 - 10 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]

"To find the final cost of 10 gallons of gas after applying the cashback, we start by calculating the total cost without any cashback. The cost per gallon is $3.00, so for 10 gallons, the total cost is:

\[
10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00 \text{ per gallon} = \$30.00
\]

Next, we calculate the total cashback received. The cashback is $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons, the total cashback is:

\[
10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20 \text{ per gallon} = \$2.00
\]

To find the final cost after applying the cashback, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost:

\[
\$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00

"To determine how much water the boat took on by the time Julia reached the shore, we start by calculating the speed at which Julia rows the boat. Given that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, her rowing speed is:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second} \]

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Julia to row the entire 64 seconds distance to the shore. Since 64 seconds is equivalent to:

\[ \text{Time to row 64 seconds} = \frac{64 \text{ seconds}}{16 \text{ seconds/20 feet}} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ feet} \]

Given that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed, the amount of water taken on for 80 feet is:

\[ \text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 2 \text{ liters} = 8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the amount of water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached the shore is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( B \) represent the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, and \( D \) represent the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, which translates to:
\[ 1800 = 6B \]
Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \]

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph:
\[ B = 50D \]
Substituting \( B = 300 \) into the equation:
\[ 300 = 50D \]
Solving for \( D \):
\[ D = \frac{300}{50} = 6 \]

Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \( 6 \).

"To determine Sasha's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of her leftover lumber and then compare it to the total revenue from selling it.

1. **Cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Sasha has 10 boards.
   - Each board costs $10.
   - Total cost for 10 boards = \( 10 \times \$10 = \$100 \).

2. **Cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   - Sasha has 5 boards.
   - Each board costs $16.
   - Total cost for 5 boards = \( 5 \times \$16 = \$80 \).

3. **Total cost of all leftover lumber:**
   - Total cost = Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards + Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards
   - Total cost = \$100 + \$80 = \$180.

Since the question does not specify the selling price, we assume the selling price is the same as the cost price. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the leftover lumber is also \$180.

4. **Profit calculation:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   - Profit = \$180 - \$180 = \$0.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. The total parts of the ratio are 7 + 13 = 20 parts.

Given that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons, we can set up the equation to find out how many parts correspond to 120 teaspoons. Since 20 parts equal 120 teaspoons, each part is:

\[
\frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons}
\]

Since the number of teaspoons of sugar is 7 parts of the ratio, the number of teaspoons of sugar used is:

2. **Determine Lylah's initial salary:**
   Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's initial salary be \( L \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   40,000 = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.3} = \frac{400,000}{13} \approx 30,769.23
   \]

3. **Determine Adrien's salary four years later:**
   Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his initial salary of $40,000. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000
   \]

4. **Determine Lylah's salary four years later:**
   Since Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%. Therefore, her new salary is:
   \[
   30,769.23 + 0.4 \times 30,769.23 = 30,769.23 \times 1.4 = 43,076.92
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later:**
   The total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later is:
   \[
   56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92
   \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is \(\boxed{99076.92}\)."
"To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we start by calculating the weekly usage. Given that Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week and each pad contains 30 sheets, the weekly usage is:
\[ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \]

Next, to find the monthly usage, we multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month. Assuming a month has approximately 4 weeks, the monthly usage is:
\[ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} \]

Therefore, the number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is:
\[ 240 \]"
"To find the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought, we start by calculating the number of fruits each brought individually.

Morisette brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

Kael brought:
- Twice the apples Morisette brought: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) apples
- Half the oranges Morisette brought: \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\) oranges

Now, we calculate the total number of fruits each brought:
- Morisette's total: \(5 + 8 = 13\) fruits
- Kael's total: \(10 + 4 = 14\) fruits

Adding these totals together:
\[ 13 + 14 = 27 \]

Thus, the total number of fruits they have is:
\[

"To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, we'll add up the hours she slept each day.

- On Monday, she slept 8 hours.
- On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, which is \(8 - 2 = 6\) hours.
- On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, which is \(6 - 2 = 4\) hours.
- On Thursday and Friday, she slept 1 hour more than the total of Tuesday and Wednesday combined. The total for Tuesday and Wednesday is \(6 + 4 = 10\) hours, so she slept \(10 + 1 = 11\) hours each day.

Now, we sum the hours for each day:
\[8 \text{ (Monday)} + 6 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 11 \text{ (Thursday)} + 11 \text{ (Friday)} = 40\]

Therefore, the total number of hours Sadie slept in the week is \(\boxed{40}\)."
"To determine the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we break the problem into two parts based on the different speeds she runs at.

First, we calculate the distance Rosie covers in the initial 3 hours at a speed of 10 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we calculate the remaining time after the initial 3 hours:
\[ \text{Remaining Time} = 7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Then, we calculate the distance Rosie covers in the remaining 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour:
\[ \text{Distance}_2 = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles} \]

Finally, we add the distances from both parts to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:
\[ \text{Total Distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = 50 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of letters Jennie stamped:**
   Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

2. **Determine the number of letters that were already stamped:**
   After stamping 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

3. **Calculate the initial number of already-stamped letters:**
   The number of already-stamped letters increased by the number of letters Jennie stamped.
   \[
   \text{Initial number of already-stamped letters} = 30 - 20 = 10
   \]

Thus, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine the hospital's profit from the visits, we need to calculate the revenue and the cost, and then find the difference between them.

1. **Calculate the total number of patient hours per day:**
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, each patient is seen for \( \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \) hours.
   - The hospital sees 500 people a day.
   - Total patient hours per day = \( 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \) hours.

2. **Calculate the revenue from the patients:**
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour to the patients.
   - Total revenue from patients = \( 200 \times 200 = 40,000 \) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost to the hospital:**
   - The doctors charge $150 per hour to the hospital.
   - Total cost to the hospital = \( 200 \times 150 = 30,000 \) dollars.

4. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue from patients - Total cost to the hospital.

1. **Initial number of elves**: Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers.
2. **Elves who quit after vomiting**: A third of the elves quit. Therefore, the number of elves who quit is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, the number of elves remaining after this is:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
3. **Elves who quit after being kicked**: 10 of the remaining elves quit after being kicked. Therefore, the number of elves remaining after this is:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of elves left is \(\boxed{30}\)."

\[ \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Next, to find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic is \( 20\% \)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( Q \) represent the number of queens.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( W \) represent the number of worker bees.

Given the relationships:
1. \( W = 2B \) (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees).
2. \( B = 2Q \) (there are twice as many baby bees as queens).
3. The total number of bees is 700, so \( W + B + Q = 700 \).

Substituting \( B = 2Q \) into \( W = 2B \):
\[ W = 2(2Q) = 4Q \]

Now, substituting \( W = 4Q \) and \( B = 2Q \) into the total bees equation:
\[ 4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \]
\[ 7Q = 700 \]
\[ Q = 100 \]

With \( Q = 100 \), we can find \( B \) and \( W \):
\[ B = 2Q = 2 \times 100 = 200 \]
\[ W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, the number of worker bees is \( 400 \).

"To find the total cost including tax, we first identify the nonfood items and their respective costs: light bulbs for $3 and roach traps for $4. The tax rate is 10%.

- Tax on light bulbs: \(3 \times 0.10 = 0.30\) dollars
- Tax on roach traps: \(4 \times 0.10 = 0.40\) dollars

Adding the tax to the original costs of the nonfood items:

- Total cost of light bulbs including tax: \(3 + 0.30 = 3.30\) dollars
- Total cost of roach traps including tax: \(4 + 0.40 = 4.40\) dollars

Next, we calculate the total cost of the food items (milk, eggs, and cups) which are not taxed:

- Cost of milk: $2
- Cost of eggs: $3
- Cost of cups: $3

Adding the costs of the food items:

- Total cost of milk: $2
- Total cost of eggs: $3
- Total cost of cups: $3

"To determine the profit Kim will make each week, we need to calculate both his total income and total expenses.

First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have:
- Current clients: 3
- Potential clients: 5
- Total clients: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Next, we calculate the total cost for the bleach and cloths for all clients:
- Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
- Cost of one bottle of bleach: $2
- Cost of one pack of cloths: $5

Total cost for bleach for 8 clients:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles/client} \times \$2/\text{bottle} = 8 \times 2 \times 2 = \$32 \]

Total cost for cloths for 8 clients:
\[ 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack/client} \times \$5/\text{pack} = 8 \times 1 \times 5 = \$40 \]

Total expenses for all clients:
\[ \$32 + \$40 = \$72 \]

Kim's total income each week is given as $92.

Now, we calculate the profit:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses} \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \]

"To determine how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours:**
   Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. **Bees returning in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the 30 bees return, which is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. **Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours:**
   Debra sees twice as many bees leave as the number that left in the first 6 hours, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]

4. **Bee population at the end of the first 12 hours:**
   Initially, there were no bees in the hive. After the first 6 hours, 30 bees left, and 15 bees returned, the net change is:
   \[
   0 - 30 + 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   So, at the end of the first 12 hours, there are:
   \[
   0 - 15 = -15 \text{ bees}
   \]
   This means there are 15 bees that left but haven't returned yet.

5. **Bee population at the end of the day:**
   In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left in the first 12 hours return to the hive. The number of bees that left in the first 12 hours is 60, and all of them return in the last 6 hours. Therefore, the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is:
   \[
   60 \text{ bees}

\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Solving for Dorothy's friends:

\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Next, we know that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. Therefore, we calculate James's friends as follows:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

Thus, James has 16 Facebook friends. The final numerical answer is:

- Time for Steve to bike home: \(\frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}\)
- Time for Tim to skateboard home: \(\frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}\)

Since Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes, Steve is the winner. The difference in their travel times is:

\[40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To calculate how much Shawnda made that day, we'll break down the costs for each type of vehicle and then sum them up.

1. **Bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - 5 people came with bicycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one bicycle: \(2 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 50 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 5 bicycles: \(5 \times 50 \text{ cents} = 250 \text{ cents}\).

2. **Tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - 3 people came with tricycles.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one tricycle: \(3 \text{ tires} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 75 \text{ cents}\).
   - Total cost for 3 tricycles: \(3 \times 75 \text{ cents} = 225 \text{ cents}\).

3. **Unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - 1 person came with a unicycle.
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Total cost for one unicycle: \(1 \text{ tire} \times 25 \text{ cents/tire} = 25 \text{ cents}\).

Now, we sum up the total cost for all the tires:
\[
250 \text{ cents} + 225 \text{ cents} + 25 \text{ cents} = 500 \text{ cents}
\]

To convert the total cost from cents to dollars:
\[
500 \text{ cents} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount Shawnda made that day is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To determine how much change Carl receives, we start by calculating the total number of cookies he buys. Given that he buys ten packs and each pack contains six cookies:

\[
\text{Total number of cookies} = 10 \times 6 = 60
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 60 \times 0.10 = 6.00
\]

Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find the change he receives, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:

\[
\text{Change} = 10.00 - 6.00 = 4.00
\]

Therefore, the amount of change Carl receives is:

\[
\boxed{4.00}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we'll work backwards from the final number of fries to find the initial number of fries Dave bought.

1. **Final Fries Left**: 5 fries.
2. **Before Ants**: The 5 fries left after the ants were carried off were 1 more than what the raccoon ate. So, the raccoon ate \(5 - 1 = 4\) fries.
3. **Before Pigeons and Raccoon**: The 4 fries eaten by the raccoon were two-thirds of what the pigeons and raccoon ate together. So, the pigeons and raccoon together ate \(4 \times \frac{3}{2} = 6\) fries. Since the pigeons ate 3 fries each, they ate a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) fries. Therefore, the pigeons and raccoon together ate \(9 + 4 = 13\) fries.
4. **Before Pigeons**: The 13 fries eaten by the pigeons and raccoon were 7 more than what the seagull ate. So, the seagull ate \(13 - 7 = 6\) fries.
5. **Before Seagull and Dave**: The 6 fries eaten by the seagull were 7 more than what Dave ate. So, Dave ate \(6 - 7 = -1\), which is incorrect.

"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we'll break down the calculation step by step.

First, we calculate the hours Kimo spends on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:
- Each of these days, he has 3 classes, each lasting 1 hour.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(3 \times 1 = 3\) hours.
- Since there are 3 such days in a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(3 \times 3 = 9\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(9 \times 16 = 144\) hours.

Next, we calculate the hours Kimo spends on Tuesdays and Thursdays:
- Each of these days, he has 2 classes, each lasting 2 hours.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day on these days is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) hours.
- Since there are 2 such days in a week (Tuesday and Thursday), the total number of hours per week on these days is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) hours.
- Over 16 weeks, the total number of hours on these days is \(8 \times 16 = 128\) hours.

Finally, we sum the hours from both types of days to get the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester:
\[144 + 128 = 272\]

Thus, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is \(\boxed{272}\)."
"To find the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end, we first convert the lengths of each type of baked good into a consistent unit, then sum them up.

1. **Length of Rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Total length of rolls = \( 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches} \).

2. **Length of Croissants:**
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 120 croissants.
   - Total length of croissants = \( 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches} \).

3. **Length of Baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is \( 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches} \).
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of baguettes = \( 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches} \).

4. **Total Length in Inches:**
   - Total length = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes
   - Total length = \( 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches} \).

5. **Convert Total Length to Feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.
   - Total length in feet = \( \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet} \).

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when put end to end is \( 280 \) feet.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{280}

"To determine the total number of bananas the zookeeper needs to order for 2 months, we'll calculate the monthly consumption for each type of ape and then multiply by 2.

1. **Monkeys:**
   - Monthly consumption: 200 bananas
   - For 2 months: \(200 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ bananas}\)

2. **Gorillas:**
   - Monthly consumption: 400 bananas
   - For 2 months: \(400 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 800 \text{ bananas}\)

3. **Baboons:**
   - Monthly consumption: 100 bananas
   - For 2 months: \(100 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 200 \text{ bananas}\)

Now, we sum the total number of bananas needed for all the apes over the 2 months:

\[
400 \text{ (monkeys)} + 800 \text{ (gorillas)} + 200 \text{ (baboons)} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
\]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how much farther Blake runs compared to Kelly, we first calculate the distance each person runs.

Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field. Each round trip is 200 yards (100 yards out and 100 yards back). Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is:
\[ 15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards} \]

Kelly runs back and forth once to the 40-yard line and back, which is a total of 80 yards (40 yards out and 40 yards back). She does this 34 times, so the total distance Kelly runs is:
\[ 34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards} \]

Now, we find the difference in the distance run by Blake and Kelly:
\[ 3000 - 2720 = 280 \text{ yards} \]

Therefore, the winner (Blake) runs 280 yards farther than the loser (Kelly). The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{280} \]"
"To find out how much Raphael spent, we start by calculating the cost of the pens:
\[ 4 \text{ pens} \times \$1.5 \text{ per pen} = 4 \times 1.5 = \$6 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the notebooks:
\[ 2 \text{ notebooks} \times \$4 \text{ per notebook} = 2 \times 4 = \$8 \]

The cost of the rim of bond paper is given as:
\[ \$20 \]

Adding these amounts together gives:
\[ \$6 + \$8 + \$20 = \$34 \]

Therefore, the total amount Raphael spent is:
\[ \boxed{34} \]"
"Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles. When 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, the total number of tadpoles Finn can see increases to 11 + 6 = 17. Then, when 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, the total number of tadpoles Finn can see decreases to 17 - 2 = 15. Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now is 15."
"To find the water depth on Wednesday, we follow these steps:

1. **Determine the water depth on Tuesday:**
   - The depth of the water on Monday is 17 feet.
   - On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than on Monday.
   - Therefore, the depth on Tuesday is \(17 + 7 = 24\) feet.

2. **Determine the water depth on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday.
   - Thus, the depth on Wednesday is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{48}{3} = 16\) feet.

Therefore, the tank’s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.

\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"To find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin, we start by calculating the number of each type of fish caught by Locsin based on the given information:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10, and Locsin caught 5 fewer, so Locsin caught \(10 - 5 = 5\) starfish.
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6, and Locsin caught 3 fewer, so Locsin caught \(6 - 3 = 3\) sea horses.
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3, and Locsin caught 2 more, so Locsin caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

Next, we sum up the fish caught by both:

- Total starfish: \(10 + 5 = 15\)
- Total sea horses: \(6 + 3 = 9\)
- Total clownfish: \(3 + 5 = 8\)

Adding these together gives the total number of fish caught:

\[
15 + 9 + 8 = 32
\]

Therefore, the total number of fish they caught is 32."
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months with a 20% increase every two months, we can use the concept of compound interest. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Identify the original price and the rate of increase:**
   - Original price: \( P_0 = \$20 \)
   - Rate of increase: 20% every two months

2. **Calculate the price increase per two months:**
   - Increase per two months: \( 20\% \) of \( \$20 \)
   - Increase per two months: \( 0.20 \times 20 = \$4 \)

3. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months:**
   - Number of two-month periods in 36 months: \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

4. **Calculate the new price after 36 months using the compound interest formula:**
   - The formula for compound interest is \( P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n \)
   - Here, \( P_0 = \$20 \), \( r = 0.20 \), and \( n = 18 \)
   - New price: \( P = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \)
   - New price: \( P = 20 \times (1.20)^{18} \)

5. **Calculate \( (1.20)^{18} \):**
   - \( (1.20)^{18} \approx 10.488 \) (using a calculator for precision)

6. **Calculate the final price:**
   - New price: \( 20 \times 10.488 \approx 209.76 \)

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is approximately \(\boxed{209.76}\)."
"To find the total value of all the toys, we start by determining the cost of each type of toy based on the given information.

1. **Red Cars**: There are 5 red cars, and each red car costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red cars} = 5 \times 4 = 20
   \]

2. **Action Figures**: There are 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of action figures} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Doll**: The doll costs as much as 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

Adding these values together gives the total cost of all the toys:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 + 15 + 15 = 50

Therefore, the total value of all the toys is **50**."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to compare the missed income from freelance work to the cost of hiring the accountant.

Jackie loses 3 hours of freelance work if she does her taxes herself. Since she earns $35 per hour from freelance work, the missed income is:
\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105 \]

The accountant charges $90. Therefore, the difference between the missed income and the cost of hiring the accountant is:
\[ \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \]

This means Jackie will have $15 less if she hires the accountant. Thus, the correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{-15} \]"
"Elvira's total budget is €1500. The total cost of the computer accessories she bought is €509. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total cost of the accessories from her budget:

Money left for clothing = €1500 - €509 = €991

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is €991."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to make 15 Spanish flans, we start by calculating the total number of eggs required. Since each flan requires 3 eggs, for 15 flans, the total number of eggs needed is:

\[ 15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs/flan} = 45 \text{ eggs} \]

Next, we need to find out how many times Sandra needs to babysit to gather 45 eggs. Given that she receives 9 eggs each time she babysits, we divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per babysitting session:

\[ \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs/babysitting}} = 5 \text{ babysittings} \]

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit 5 times to gather enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given conditions:
1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke: \( S = 2B \).
2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28: \( (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

First, simplify the second equation:
\[
S + B + 4 = 28
\]
\[
S + B = 24
\]

Now, substitute the first equation \( S = 2B \) into the simplified second equation:
\[
2B + B = 24
\]
\[
3B = 24
\]
\[
B = 8
\]

Using \( B = 8 \) in the first equation \( S = 2B \):
\[
S = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

Thus, Seth is currently 16 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]"
"Jimmy has $18. 

To verify, if Ethel has $8, then twice that amount is \(2 \times 8 = 16\). Adding $2 to this amount gives \(16 + 2 = 18\). Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

"To calculate the total miles Pancho walks in a week, we start by considering his daily walking routine. On weekdays, he walks 20 miles each day, and there are 5 weekdays in a week. Therefore, the total miles walked on weekdays is:

\[ 5 \text{ days} \times 20 \text{ miles/day} = 100 \text{ miles} \]

On weekends, he walks 10 miles each day, and there are 2 days in the weekend. Therefore, the total miles walked on weekends is:

\[ 2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ miles/day} = 20 \text{ miles} \]

Adding the miles walked on weekdays and weekends gives us the total miles walked in a week:

\[ 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 120 miles."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we'll break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of the hat:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the hat} = \$25
   \]

2. **Cost of the jacket:**
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
   \]

3. **Cost of the pants:**
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.
   \[
   \text{Average cost of the hat and jacket} = \frac{\$25 + \$75}{2} = \frac{\$100}{2} = \$50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the pants} = \$50
   \]

4. **Total cost of each uniform:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket} + \text{Cost of the pants}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \$25 + \$75 + \$50 = \$150

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is:
\[ \boxed{1210} \]"
"Given the information:

1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

The total age of the four birds is the sum of the ages of Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and the Caboose. Assuming the Caboose is also 8 years old, the total age is:

\[
\text{Total age} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51

Therefore, the total age of the four birds is 51."
"To determine how much Jessica pays in a year if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, we first calculate the total minimum monthly payments for all her debts:

- Student loans: $300/month
- Credit card: $200/month
- Mortgage: $500/month

Total minimum monthly payments:
\[ 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month} \]

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find 50% more, we calculate 50% of the minimum monthly payments and add it to the minimum monthly payments.

50% of $1000 is:
\[ 0.50 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars} \]

So, 50% more than the minimum monthly payments is:
\[ 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month} \]

To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply the monthly amount by 12 (the number of months in a year):
\[ 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars/year} \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 18000 \]"
"To determine the total time Billy will take to prep 60 potatoes, we start by calculating the time it takes to peel and cut one potato.

- Time to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds
- Time to cut one potato: 5 seconds

Adding these times together gives the total time to prep one potato:
\[ 90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we calculate the total time for 60 potatoes:
\[ 60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds} \]

Finally, we convert the total time from seconds to minutes:
\[ 5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 95 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is:
\[ \boxed{95 \text{ minutes}} \]"
"To determine how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we start by setting up the equations based on the given information.

First, we calculate the revenue from selling lemonade. They sell 20 glasses per gallon at $0.50 per glass, so the revenue per gallon is:
\[ 20 \text{ glasses/gallon} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10/\text{gallon} \]

Given that their profit is $25, we can express the profit as the total revenue minus the total cost. The total revenue from selling \( x \) gallons is:
\[ \$10x \]

The total cost includes the cost of lemons and sugar. The cost of lemons and sugar per gallon is:
\[ \$3 \text{ (lemons/gallon)} + \$2 \text{ (sugar/gallon)} = \$5/\text{gallon} \]

Thus, the total cost for \( x \) gallons is:
\[ \$5x \]

The profit equation is:
\[ \$10x - \$5x = \$25 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ \$5x = \$25 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{\$25}{\$5} = 5 \]

So, they sold 5 gallons of lemonade. Now, we calculate the total cost of lemons for 5 gallons:
\[ \$3 \text{ (lemons/gallon)} \times 5 \text{ gallons} = \$15 \]

Therefore, the amount they spent on lemons is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we start with the total number of Chinese participants, which is 160. Given that there are 60 boys on the Chinese team, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

Therefore, the number of girls on the Chinese team is 100."
"To determine how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount spent on rent, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary.
2. Calculate the amount spent on car fuel, which is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary.
3. Determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
4. Calculate the donation to charity, which is half of the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
5. Determine the remaining amount after the donation.
6. Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount.

Given:
- Zaid's monthly salary: $6000
- Rent: \(\frac{1}{4}\) of his salary
- Car fuel: \(\frac{1}{3}\) of his salary
- Donation to charity: half of the remaining amount after rent and car fuel
- Amount given to daughter: $200
- Amount given to wife: $700

First, calculate the amount spent on rent:
\[
\text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500
\]

Next, calculate the amount spent on car fuel:
\[
\text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
\]

Now, determine the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500
\]

Calculate the donation to charity, which is half of the remaining amount:
\[
\text{Donation to charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250
\]

Determine the remaining amount after the donation:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250
\]

Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350
\]

Thus, the final amount of money Zaid will have left is:
\[
\boxed{350}

"To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we start by determining the number of crabs each person has based on the given information.

Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monic has:
\[ 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ crabs} \]

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, so Rani has:
\[ 36 + 10 = 46 \text{ crabs} \]

Adding the number of crabs each person has gives:
\[ 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \text{ crabs} \]

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have together is:
\[ \boxed{122} \]"
"To calculate Lloyd's total earnings for the first two weeks, we start by determining his earnings for each week separately and then summing them up.

For the first week, Lloyd earned:
\[ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50 \]

For the second week, Lloyd earned:
\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80 \]

Adding the earnings from both weeks gives us the total:
\[ \$50 + \$80 = \$130 \]

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of \$130 for the first two weeks."
"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we start with the total number of votes cast, which is 80. The winner received \(\frac{3}{4}\) of these votes. First, we calculate the number of votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received is the total votes minus the votes the winner received:

\[
\text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is \(\boxed{20}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the information given:

- Let \( w \) represent the number of white carnations Sandra ordered.
- According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4w \).
- Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which are five times the number of white carnations, so \( 5w = 200 \).

First, we solve for \( w \) using the equation \( 5w = 200 \):
\[
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

With \( w = 40 \), we can now find the number of red roses:
\[
4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

Therefore, the number of red roses that Fred must deliver by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business is 160.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine Jean's current age, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let's denote:
- \( J \) as Jean's current age,
- \( M \) as Mark's current age,
- \( A \) as Jan's current age.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark, so \( J = M + 2 \).
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Two years ago, Jan's age was \( A - 2 \), so half of Jan's age two years ago was \( \frac{A - 2}{2} \). Therefore, Mark's age two years ago was \( \frac{A - 2}{2} + 5 \). Since Mark's age two years ago was \( M - 2 \), we have the equation \( M - 2 = \frac{A - 2}{2} + 5 \).

Given that Jan's current age \( A \) is 30, we substitute \( A = 30 \) into the second equation:
\[ M - 2 = \frac{30 - 2}{2} + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = \frac{28}{2} + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 14 + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 19 \]
\[ M = 21 \]

Now, using the first equation \( J = M + 2 \):
\[ J = 21 + 2 \]
\[ J = 23 \]

Therefore, Jean's current age is 23."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay race.

### Team 1 (Very Well-Rounded Team)
Each member of Team 1 runs their 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time taken by Team 1 is:
\[
55 \text{ seconds/member} \times 4 \text{ members} = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Team 2 (Less Well-Rounded Team)
The first runner of Team 2 takes 60 seconds to run their 400 meters. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the times for each runner are:
- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

The total time taken by Team 2 is the sum of the times for each runner:
\[
60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Difference in Time
To find out how many seconds the faster team (Team 1) will win by, we subtract the total time taken by Team 1 from the total time taken by Team 2:
\[
222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds} = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team (Team 1) will win by:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then find the difference.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3
A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability \( P(\text{number} > 3) \) is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row
The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also:
\[
P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of both events happening (rolling an even number on the first roll and an even number on the second roll) is:
\[
P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = P(\text{even number on first roll}) \times P(\text{even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in probabilities
We need to find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. This is given by the difference in probabilities divided by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row, and then converted to a percentage.

The difference in probabilities is:
\[
P(\text{number} > 3) - P(\text{even number on first roll and even number on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To find how much more likely it is, we divide this difference by the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row and then convert to a percentage:
\[
\text{Percentage more likely} = \left( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \right) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{100}

"To determine the number of rats in each cage, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage. We know there are 3 cages of rats, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is \( 3 \times 6r = 18r \).

We also know that the total number of pieces of straw distributed among the small rodents is 160. This total includes the straw given to the hamsters and the straw given to the rabbits. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw, so the total for the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) pieces. There are 20 pieces of straw distributed among the rabbits.

Thus, the equation for the total pieces of straw is:
\[ 18r + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 18r + 70 = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 18r = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ r = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine how much Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial amount owed**: $100
2. **Monthly interest rate**: 2% or 0.02
3. **Number of months**: 3

First, calculate the interest for one month:
\[ \text{Interest per month} = 100 \times 0.02 = 2 \]

Next, calculate the total interest for 3 months:
\[ \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Now, add the total interest to the initial amount owed to find the total amount Mandy should pay:
\[ \text{Total amount to pay} = 100 + 6 = 106 \]

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict **$106**.

The correct answer is **$106**."
"To determine the number of bags of wheat sold, we start by setting up the equation based on the given information. The trader buys \( n \) bags of wheat at $20 per bag, which totals to \( 20n \) dollars. The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is \( 2n \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost incurred is:
\[ 20n + 2n = 22n \text{ dollars} \]

The trader sells each bag at $30, so the total revenue from selling \( n \) bags is:
\[ 30n \text{ dollars} \]

The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, and it is given that the trader made a total profit of $400. Thus, we can write the profit equation as:
\[ 30n - 22n = 400 \]
\[ 8n = 400 \]
\[ n = \frac{400}{8} \]
\[ n = 50 \]

Therefore, the trader sold \(\boxed{50}\) bags of wheat."

"To determine the daily amount of insects needed for a flock of ten ducks, we start with the weekly requirement for one duck, which is 3.5 pounds. Since there are 7 days in a week, we first find the daily requirement for one duck:

\[ \text{Daily requirement for one duck} = \frac{3.5 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total daily requirement for ten ducks by multiplying the daily requirement for one duck by the number of ducks:

\[ \text{Daily requirement for ten ducks} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/day} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

Therefore, the total amount of insects needed per day for the flock of ten ducks is:

"To determine the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years, we follow these steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. **Net increase in trees each year**: Each year, Tom plants 10 trees and chops down 2 trees, resulting in a net increase of \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees per year.
3. **Number of trees after 10 years without any deaths**: Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is \(8 \times 10 = 80\). Adding this to the initial number of trees, we get \(50 + 80 = 130\) trees.
4. **Trees that die after 10 years**: After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. Therefore, the number of trees that die is \(0.30 \times 130 = 39\).
5. **Number of trees left after the deaths**: Subtracting the number of trees that die from the total number of trees after 10 years, we get \(130 - 39 = 91\) trees.

Thus, the number of trees Tom has left after 10 years is \(\boxed{91}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial number of pink plastic flamingos on Friday morning:** 18

2. **On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos and painted them white:**
   - One third of 18 flamingos is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) flamingos.
   - So, 6 pink flamingos were taken back and painted white.

3. **Number of flamingos left on Sue's front yard after Saturday morning:**
   - Initially, there were 18 flamingos.
   - 6 flamingos were taken back and painted white.
   - Therefore, \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) pink flamingos remained.

4. **On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos:**
   - Adding 18 more pink flamingos to the 12 remaining flamingos:
   - \( 12 + 18 = 30 \) pink flamingos.

5. **Number of white flamingos:**
   - The neighbors painted 6 pink flamingos white.
   - Therefore, there are 6 white flamingos.

6. **At noon on Sunday, the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**
   - Pink flamingos: 30
   - White flamingos: 6

7. **Difference between the number of pink flamingos and white flamingos:**

"A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined. Given that a pencil costs $1.20 and an eraser costs $0.30, the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser is $1.50. Therefore, a pen costs $1.50. To find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply $1.50 by 8, which equals $12.00. Thus, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00."
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we start with the total amount of carrots available, which is 200 pounds. Each of the 40 restaurants receives 2 pounds of carrots. 

First, we calculate the total amount of carrots distributed:
\[ 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we subtract the total amount distributed from the initial amount:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine the number of children in the city of Soda, we start with the total population and subtract the number of men and women.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

Number of children = Total population - (Number of men + Number of women)
Number of children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
Number of children = 23786 - 17509
Number of children = 6277

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6277."
"To determine the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now, we will follow the steps systematically:

1. **Initial number of cards:**
   Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards.

2. **Cards collected in the first month:**
   She collects three times the initial number.
   \[
   3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
   \]

3. **Cards collected in the second month:**
   She collects 20 fewer cards than those collected in the first month.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
   \]

4. **Cards collected in the third month:**
   She collects twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months.
   \[
   2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

5. **Total number of cards collected over the three months:**
   \[
   60 + 40 + 200 = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

6. **Total number of cards Elaine has now:**
   Adding the initial number of cards to the total collected over the three months.
   \[
   20 + 200 = 220 \text{ cards}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now is:

"To determine how much Mark makes in a week, we start by identifying the rates and the number of sentences edited. We know that Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence and Publisher B pays twice that amount, which is 10 cents per sentence. Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.

First, we calculate the earnings from Publisher A:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents per sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents} \]

Next, we calculate the earnings from Publisher B:
\[ 1000 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents per sentence} = 10000 \text{ cents} \]

Adding the earnings from both publishers gives us the total weekly earnings:
\[ 5000 \text{ cents} + 10000 \text{ cents} = 15000 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:
\[ \boxed{15000} \]"

Thus, the total amount of water Baldur gets every day is:

\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine John's total earnings for the year after winning the award, we need to consider both the one-time monetary reward and the increase in his weekly salary.

1. **Monetary Reward:**
   John receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000.

2. **Salary Increase:**
   John's original weekly salary is $2000. The award provides a 5% raise in his salary.
   \[
   \text{Salary increase} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100
   \]
   Therefore, his new weekly salary is:
   \[
   2000 + 100 = 2100
   \]

3. **Total Weekly Earnings:**
   With the salary increase, John's total weekly earnings are:
   \[
   2100
   \]

4. **Total Earnings for the Year:**
   There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, his total earnings for the year are:
   \[
   2100 \times 52 = 109200
   \]

5. **Total Earnings Including the Monetary Reward:**
   Adding the one-time monetary reward to his total earnings for the year:
   \[
   109200 + 5000 = 114200
   \]

"To determine the total number of cheese slices Carl used, we will break down the problem into parts and calculate step by step.

1. **Sandwiches for lunch:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for 5 days.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese slices for sandwiches: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 10 \text{ slices} \).

2. **Omelets for breakfast:**
   - Carl ate omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   - Each omelet uses 1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich.
   - Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) slices.
   - Total cheese slices for omelets: \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \).

3. **Macaroni and cheese for dinner:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week.
   - He used 8 slices of cheese in the big dish.
   - Total cheese slices for macaroni and cheese: \( 8 \text{ slices} \).

Now, we sum up all the cheese slices used:
\[ 10 \text{ slices (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ slices (omelets)} + 8 \text{ slices (macaroni and cheese)} = 27 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the total number of cheese slices Carl used is:
\[ \boxed{27} \]"

"To determine the score Brinley needs on her sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we can use the concept of weighted averages. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Calculate the sum of the first five test scores:**
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 440
   \]

2. **Determine the total sum of the six test scores needed to achieve an average of 93:**
   The average of six tests is 93, so the total sum of the six test scores should be:
   \[
   93 \times 6 = 558
   \]

3. **Find the score required on the sixth test:**
   Let \( x \) be the score on the sixth test. The sum of all six test scores is:
   \[
   440 + x = 558
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 558 - 440 = 118

"To find the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike, we'll break the problem into two parts: the first four weeks and the next three weeks.

**First Four Weeks:**
- Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week.
- Each time he rode 25 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the first four weeks is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
- Over four weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

**Next Three Weeks:**
- Micheal decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week.
- Each time he rode 60 kilometers.
- Therefore, the number of kilometers he rode each week for the next three weeks is \(2 \times 60 = 120\) kilometers.
- Over three weeks, the total kilometers he rode is \(3 \times 120 = 360\) kilometers.

**Total Kilometers:**
- Adding the kilometers from the first four weeks and the next three weeks, we get \(500 + 360 = 860\) kilometers.

Thus, the total number of kilometers Micheal rode his bike is \(\boxed{860}\)."
"To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we start by calculating the weight of each type of candy. Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams and each candied apple weighs half as much, each candied apple weighs:

\[ \text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{40 \text{ grams}}{2} = 20 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars. Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is:

\[ \text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams} \]

Then, we calculate the total weight of the candied apples. Joe has 80 candied apples, so the total weight of the candied apples is:

\[ \text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams} \]

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the total weight of the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\[ \text{Total weight of Joe's bag of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 2600 grams."
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought in total over the three days, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Monday:** Rose bought 4 cakes.
2. **Tuesday:** She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Therefore, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes.
3. **Wednesday:** She bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Therefore, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.

Now, we sum the cakes bought each day:
\[
\text{Total cakes} = 4 + 12 + 60 = 76
\]

Thus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(\boxed{76}\)."
"To find the cost of each cup, we start by setting up the equation based on the information provided:

1. The total cost of half a dozen plates is $36000.
2. The total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $34800.
3. Let the cost of one cup be \( x \) dollars. Therefore, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is \( 240x \).

From the problem, we have:
\[ 240x = 34800 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = \frac{34800}{240} \]

Performing the division:
\[ x = 145 \]

Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is \( 145 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{145}

"To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes, we start by calculating the total cost of the items she wants to buy. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20, with 2 pairs needed. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 30 + 2 \times 20 = 30 + 40 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

Sara already has $10 saved. The additional amount she needs to earn is:

\[ 70 - 10 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Sara earns $4 for each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn $60, we set up the equation:

\[ 4x = 60 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \]

Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 15 times to afford the jacket and shoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the system of equations based on the given information. Let \( r \) represent the number of red chickens and \( w \) represent the number of white chickens. We know two things:

1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs per day.
2. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs per day.
3. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

From the third piece of information, we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens:
\[ w = r + 2 \]

From the total number of eggs collected per day, we can write the equation:
\[ 3r + 5w = 42 \]

Substituting \( w = r + 2 \) into the second equation:
\[ 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \]
\[ 8r + 10 = 42 \]

Subtract 10 from both sides:
\[ 8r = 32 \]

Divide both sides by 8:
\[ r = 4 \]

Thus, the number of red chickens Jerry has is \( 4 \).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"To determine how many hours Gary spends walking around the park, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the park:
- Length = 6 miles
- Width = 1.5 miles

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we calculate the time \( t \) it takes Gary to walk this distance at a speed of 3 miles per hour. The time is given by:

\[ t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \]

Here, the distance is 15 miles and the speed is 3 miles per hour:

\[ t = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} \]
\[ t = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"Certainly! Let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
2. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day, which totals to 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
3. The total number of customers over the three days is 500.

To find out how many customers she counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers from the first and second days from the total number of customers:
\[ 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250 \]

Therefore, the number of customers she counted on the third day is 250."
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the given conditions. Let \( S \) represent the current amount of water in the small pool and \( B \) represent the current amount of water in the big pool.

Given that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, we can write:
\[ B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ B + 16 = 2S + 32 \]
\[ B = 2S + 16 \]

We are also given that the current amount of water in the big pool is four times the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[ B = 4S \]

Now, we have the system of equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

By equating the two expressions for \( B \):
\[ 2S + 16 = 4S \]

Solving for \( S \):
\[ 16 = 4S - 2S \]
\[ 16 = 2S \]
\[ S = 8 \]

Thus, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to buy a pair of shoes costing $320.00 and a matching belt costing $32.00, we first calculate the total cost of the items:

\[ 320.00 + 32.00 = 352.00 \]

Lori earns $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ \frac{352.00}{8.00} = 44.00 \]

Therefore, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can make her purchase. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months, we start by calculating the total amount she promised to return, which includes the principal plus 10% interest. The principal amount is $2000, and the interest is 10% of $2000:

\[ \text{Interest} = 10\% \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

Adding the interest to the principal gives the total amount to be returned:

\[ \text{Total amount to be returned} = 2000 + 200 = 2200 \]

Next, we calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months, with a monthly payment of $165:

\[ \text{Total payments} = 165 \times 12 = 1980 \]

Finally, the remaining balance after 12 months is the total amount to be returned minus the total payments:

\[ \text{Remaining balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220 \]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months is **$220**."
"To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we start with the number of roses, which is 4. Given that there are 7 more dahlias than roses, we calculate the number of dahlias as follows:

\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Next, we add the number of roses and dahlias to determine the total number of flowers:

\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then find their average age in three years.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age:**
   Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Zack's current age:**
   Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Adrian's current age:**
   Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, Adrian's current age is:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate their ages in three years:**
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Harriet's age in 3 years} = 21 + 3 = 24
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Zack's age in 3 years} = 42 + 3 = 45
     \]
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[
     \text{Adrian's age in 3 years} = 63 + 3 = 66
     \]

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years:**
   The average age is the sum of their ages in three years divided by 3:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Harriet's age in 3 years} + \text{Zack's age in 3 years} + \text{Adrian's age in 3 years}}{3} = \frac{24 + 45 + 66}{3}

"To determine how many points Jojo scored, we start by calculating the points scored by Yuri and Brianna based on the information provided.

1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Therefore, Yuri's score is:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]
3. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Therefore, Brianna's score is:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

Next, we sum the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
\[
\text{Total points by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna} = 68 + 44 + 85 = 197
\]

Given that the total points scored by all four students is 251, we can find Jojo's score by subtracting the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the overall total:
\[
\text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54
\]

Therefore, Jojo scored \(\boxed{54}\) points."

"Chad ordered a build-your-own burrito with additional items. The base burrito costs $6.50. Adding extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and two sauces at $0.25 each brings the subtotal to $11.00. He then upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, making the total $14.00. With a $5.00 gift card, the amount he still owes is $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00. Therefore, the final amount Chad still owes is $9.00."
"To determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360-piece puzzle, we first calculate their combined rate of placing pieces.

Kalinda places pieces at a rate of 4 pieces per minute.
Her mom places pieces at a rate of half of Kalinda's rate, which is:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Together, their combined rate is:
\[ 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute} \]

Next, we find out how many minutes it will take them to place all 360 pieces by dividing the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
\[ \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces per minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \]

Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we start with the total number of watermelons produced, which is 120.

First, we calculate the number of watermelons that were ready for harvest after the first two months. Since 30% of the watermelons were ready, we compute:

\[ 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \]

This means that 36 watermelons were ready for harvest and Ashlyn took them home. Therefore, the number of watermelons remaining after she took the ready ones is:

\[ 120 - 36 = 84 \]

Next, we need to find out how many of the remaining 84 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Since 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, we calculate:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \]

This means that 63 watermelons were ready for harvest two weeks later. Consequently, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ 84 - 63 = 21 \]

Thus, the number of melons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company. Each car sells for $20,000. He pays 10% tax on the cars and then another $1000 for registration on each of them. To find out how much he pays for everything, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   \[
   \text{Tax on cars} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost before registration fees:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost before registration} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total registration cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1000 = 12,000
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays is **$276,000**."
"To determine how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday, we start by calculating the number of shells she collected on Monday. Given that Robert collected 20 shells and Kylie collected 5 more than Robert, we find:

\[
\text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = 20 + 5 = 25
\]

Next, we need to find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday. The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times the number of shells she collected on Monday. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Kylie's shells on Tuesday} = 2 \times 25 = 50
\]

Thus, the number of shells Kylie collected on Tuesday is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Given that there are 50 ants and half as many bugs as ants, the number of bugs is:

\[ \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

To find the total number of insects, we add the number of ants and the number of bugs:

\[ \text{Total number of insects} = 50 + 25 = 75 \]

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is:

\[ 75 \]"
"To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we start with the total number of penguins, which is 36.

First, we calculate how many penguins jump into the ocean. Since one-third of the penguins jump in, we perform the calculation:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins jump into the ocean.

Next, we calculate how many penguins go into the cave. Again, one-third of the penguins go into the cave:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
\]
So, 12 penguins go into the cave.

Now, we add the number of penguins that jump into the ocean and those that go into the cave to find the total number of penguins that leave the snow:
\[
12 + 12 = 24
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of penguins that leave the snow from the total number of penguins to find out how many are still sunbathing:
\[
36 - 24 = 12
\]

Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we start by calculating the total weekly intake of tomatoes for both Steve and his girlfriend. Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and his girlfriend eats half of that, which is 3 tomatoes per day. Therefore, their combined daily intake is:

\[ 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} + 3 \text{ tomatoes/day} = 9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \]

Next, we calculate their combined weekly intake by multiplying their daily intake by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ 9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes/week} \]

Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total weekly intake by the number of tomatoes each vine produces:

\[ \frac{63 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 21 \text{ vines} \]

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines. The final answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we start by calculating the total number of pizza slices required:

- John has 20 friends.
- Each friend will have 4 slices.
- Total slices needed = 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.

Next, we consider how many slices are in each pizza:
- Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

To find the number of pizzas needed, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
- Number of pizzas = Total slices needed / Slices per pizza = 80 slices / 8 slices per pizza = 10 pizzas.

Since John cannot order a fraction of a pizza and needs to ensure each friend gets at least 4 slices, he must round up to the nearest whole number. In this case, 10 pizzas is already a whole number, so no rounding is necessary.

Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas.

The final numerical answer is:
10"
"To determine the total number of pens Ram can have, we start with the initial 25 pens he buys. For every 5 empty pens, he can make 1 new pen. 

First, we calculate how many sets of 5 pens are in the initial 25 pens:
\[
\frac{25}{5} = 5
\]
This means Ram can make 5 new pens from the 25 empty pens. 

Adding these new pens to the initial 25 pens gives us the total number of pens:
\[
25 + 5 = 30
\]

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is \(\boxed{30}\)."
"Johnny started with $20 and added an extra $10, making the total $30. When this sum triples, the calculation is $30 * 3 = $90. Therefore, after a year, Johnny has $90."
"To find the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, we start with the given information:

1. Jessa's age is 20 years.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is \(20 + 5 = 25\) years.
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is \(25 - 2 = 23\) years.

Now, we sum their ages:
\[
\text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Jessa's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Mary's age} = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68
\]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is \(\boxed{68}\)."
"To determine the number of students who exited through exit C, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students exiting through exit A**:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]
   So, 300 students exited through exit A.

2. **Determine the remaining students after exit A**:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students exiting through exit B**:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \text{ of the remaining 700 students} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]
   So, 420 students exited through exit B.

4. **Calculate the number of students exiting through exit C**:
   \[
   700 - 420 = 280
   \]

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.

The final answer is \(\boxed{280}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Robert's Candies:**
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has.
   - John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     2R = 54
     \]
   - Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

2. **Determine James's Candies:**
   - Let \( J \) represent the number of candies James has.
   - James has 6 more candies than Robert.
   - Robert has 27 candies.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
     \]

3. **Find the Difference Between John's and James's Candies:**
   - John has 54 candies.
   - James has 33 candies.
   - The difference is:

"To determine the total number of books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read, we need to consider the following:

1. Dolly has 2 books.
2. Pandora has 1 book.

Each person reads their own books and also reads the books of the other person. Therefore, we calculate the total books read by each person and then sum them up.

For Dolly:
- Dolly reads her own books: 2 books.
- Dolly reads Pandora's book: 1 book.
- Total books Dolly reads: \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

For Pandora:
- Pandora reads her own book: 1 book.
- Pandora reads Dolly's books: 2 books.
- Total books Pandora reads: \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Adding the total books read by both Dolly and Pandora:
- Total books read by Dolly: 3 books.
- Total books read by Pandora: 3 books.

"Mike initially had 5 pen pals. After stopping being pen pals with 2 of them, he has 3 pen pals left. Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long. Therefore, each pen pal sends:

\[ 2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} \]

Since there are 3 pen pals, the total number of pages sent by all pen pals in a week is:

\[ 3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal/week} = 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike responds to each of these 3 pen pals in kind, so he also sends 30 pages a week. Therefore, the total number of pages Mike writes in a week is:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \]

Mike can write a page every 6 minutes. To find out how many hours he spends writing a week, we first convert the total number of pages into minutes:

\[ 30 \text{ pages/week} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes/week} \]

Next, we convert the total minutes into hours:

\[ 180 \text{ minutes/week} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3 \text{ hours/week} \]

So, the total number of hours Mike spends writing a week is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we start by calculating the total minutes he has used. He makes a 15-minute call to his boss every day, and there are 30 days in the month, so the total minutes for these calls is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding the extra 300 minutes he used for calls to other people gives us:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Subtracting the total minutes used from his plan's allowance of 1000 minutes, we get:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is:

"To solve the problem, let's follow the sequence of events step by step:

1. Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. Kyle takes 5 fries, leaving Griffin with \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. After Billy takes his share, Griffin has \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries left.
4. Let \(x\) be the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin. After receiving \(x\) fries, Griffin has \(9 + x\) fries.
5. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries. After Colby takes his share, Griffin has \(9 + x - 2 = 7 + x\) fries left.
6. According to the problem, Griffin ends up with 27 fries. Therefore, we set up the equation:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]
7. Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Thus, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To determine the weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten, we start by calculating the total weight of the entire tree before any damage. Given that each 10-foot section of the tree weighs 400 pounds, we can find the total weight by dividing the total length of the tree by the length of each section and then multiplying by the weight of each section:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \left(\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}}\right) \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we account for the damage caused by the termites. Since the termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood, 70% of the wood remains. We calculate the remaining weight as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times (1 - 0.30) = 8000 \text{ pounds} \times 0.70 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten is:

\[
\boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}

2. Andrea has 52 apples, so \( A_a = 52 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: \( A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \).
4. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: \( J_b = J_a + 4 \).

First, we find the number of apples Jamal has:
\[ 52 = J_a + 8 \]
\[ J_a = 52 - 8 \]
\[ J_a = 44 \]

Next, we find the number of bananas Jamal has:
\[ J_b = J_a + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 44 + 4 \]
\[ J_b = 48 \]

Now, we find the number of bananas Andrea has:
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b \]
\[ A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \]
\[ A_b = 24 \]

Finally, we calculate the total number of fruits:
\[ \text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_b + J_a + J_b \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \]
\[ \text{Total fruits} = 168 \]

Therefore, the total number of fruits is 168."
"To determine the total cups of flour Carla will need, we start by calculating the total number of cookies she is making:

- Carla is making 36 cookies today.
- Carla is making 30 cookies tomorrow.
- Therefore, the total number of cookies is \(36 + 30 = 66\).

Next, we know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make 12 cookies. To find out how many cups of flour are needed for 66 cookies, we set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{x \text{ cups}}{66 \text{ cookies}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{2 \text{ cups} \times 66 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{132}{12} = 11 \text{ cups}
\]

Therefore, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]"
"To find the total dollar amount in a stack that contains two thirds of the pennies in the cup, we start by calculating the number of pennies in the stack. Given there are 9,300 pennies in the cup, we need to find two thirds of this amount:

\[
\text{Number of pennies in the stack} = 9300 \times \frac{2}{3}
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
9300 \times \frac{2}{3} = 9300 \times 0.6667 = 6100
\]

So, there are 6100 pennies in the stack. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100 since 100 pennies equal 1 dollar:

\[
\text{Total dollar amount} = \frac{6100}{100} = 61
\]

Therefore, the total dollar amount in the stack is:

\[
\boxed{61}
\]"
"Maddison starts with 5 boxes, each containing 50 marbles. Therefore, the total number of marbles she has initially is:

\[ 5 \times 50 = 250 \text{ marbles} \]

Then she receives 20 more marbles from her friend. Adding these to her initial count gives:

\[ 250 + 20 = 270 \text{ marbles} \]

Thus, the final number of marbles Maddison has is 270."
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of trees each person has based on the given information.

First, we know that Chris has 6 trees. Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has, so we calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has as follows:
\[
\text{Number of trees Ferdinand has} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of trees Harry has. Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, we calculate twice the number of trees Ferdinand has:
\[
2 \times 3 = 6
\]
Then, we add 5 to this amount to find the number of trees Harry has:
\[
6 + 5 = 11
\]

Finally, to find out how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand, we subtract the number of trees Ferdinand has from the number of trees Harry has:
\[
11 - 3 = 8
\]

Therefore, Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]"
"To find out how much money all three girls have combined, we start by calculating the individual amounts:

- Carmen has $100.
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen, which is $100 + $25 = $125.
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha, which is $125 + $50 = $175.

Next, we add these amounts together to find the total:
\[ 100 + 125 + 175 = 400 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money all three girls have combined is **$400**."
"To determine how much more the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total price including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

1. **Calculate the Brokerage Fee**:
\[ \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500 \]

2. **Calculate the Transfer Fee**:
\[ \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000 \]

3. **Calculate the Total Price Including Fees**:
\[ \text{Total Price} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500 \]

4. **Determine the Excess Over the Budget**:
\[ \text{Excess} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 \]

Therefore, the total price of the house exceeds Mrs. Cruz's budget by $9,500.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 9500 \]"
"To determine Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to account for all the expenses and the loan repayment. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the transfer fees:**
   The transfer fees are 3% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Transfer fees} = 0.03 \times 400,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price.
   \[
   \text{Brokerage fee} = 0.05 \times 400,000 = 20,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   The total expenses include the transfer fees and the brokerage fee.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 12,000 + 20,000 = 32,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the net proceeds from the sale:**
   The net proceeds from the sale of the house is the selling price minus the total expenses.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds from sale} = 400,000 - 32,000 = 368,000
   \]

5. **Subtract the loan repayment:**
   Mr. Tan also paid $250,000 for the remaining loan amount.
   \[
   \text{Net proceeds} = 368,000 - 250,000 = 118,000
   \]

Thus, Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house is:
\[
\boxed{118000}
\]"
"To determine the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken, we need to break down the problem into its components and calculate each step carefully.

1. **Time to heat the oil to 300 degrees:** This is given as 20 minutes.
2. **Time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:** This is 40% longer than the time to heat to 300 degrees. First, calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
   \[
   0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Adding this to the initial 20 minutes:
   \[
   20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes}
   \]
3. **Time to cook the chicken:** This is 5 minutes less than the time to heat the oil to 400 degrees:
   \[
   28 - 5 = 23 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, summing up all the times:
\[
20 \text{ (heating to 300 degrees)} + 28 \text{ (heating to 400 degrees)} + 23 \text{ (cooking)} = 71 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is **71 minutes**."
"To find the total amount spent by the real estate agent on all the ads, we start by calculating the cost for the newspaper ads and the television ads separately.

For the newspaper ads:
- Cost per newspaper ad = $5
- Number of newspaper ads = 50
- Total cost for newspaper ads = $5 * 50 = $250

For the television ads:
- Cost per television ad = $75
- Number of television ads = 15
- Total cost for television ads = $75 * 15 = $1125

Adding these two amounts together gives the total amount spent:
- Total amount spent = $250 + $1125 = $1375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads."
"To find the number of blue golf balls, we start with the total number of balls, which is 16. Since half of these balls are golf balls, we calculate the number of golf balls as follows:

\[
\text{Number of golf balls} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
\]

Next, we know that half of these golf balls are blue. Therefore, we calculate the number of blue golf balls as:

\[
\text{Number of blue golf balls} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]

Thus, the number of blue golf balls is 4."
"To find the total number of M&Ms Mary got, we start by calculating the number of M&Ms in each bag:

- The first bag has 300 M&Ms.
- The second bag has 12 more M&Ms than the first, so it has \(300 + 12 = 312\) M&Ms.
- The third bag has half the number of M&Ms that the first bag had, so it has \(\frac{300}{2} = 150\) M&Ms.

Adding these together, we get:
\[300 + 312 + 150 = 762\]

Therefore, the total number of M&Ms Mary got is 762.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{762}\)."
"To find the total number of windows in John's two houses, we'll break down the problem into two parts: the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows.

1. **Windows in Bedrooms:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms of both houses is:
     \[
     6 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 12 \text{ windows}
     \]

2. **Additional Windows:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of additional windows in one house is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house}
     \]
   - For both houses, the total number of additional windows is:
     \[
     4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Total Windows:**
   - Adding the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows gives:
     \[
     12 \text{ windows (bedrooms)} + 8 \text{ windows (additional)} = 20 \text{ windows}
     \]

Thus, the total number of windows between the two houses is:
\[
\boxed{20}

"To find out how much change the mother gets back, we first calculate the total cost of the items she bought.

The cost of the cocoa is $4.20.
The cost of the laundry is $9.45.
The cost of the package of pasta is $1.35.

We add these amounts together to find the total cost:
\[ 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35 = 15.00 \]

The total cost of the items is $15.00. The mother pays with $20.00. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00 \]

Therefore, the change the cashier gives back is:
\[ \boxed{5.00} \]"
"To determine the number of stitches each sleeve takes, we start by analyzing the given information and breaking it down step by step.

1. **Body of the sweater:**
   The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.

2. **Collar:**
   The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the collar} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
   \]

3. **Rosette:**
   The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180
   \]

4. **Total stitches for the collar and rosette:**
   \[
   \text{Total stitches for collar and rosette} = 90 + 180 = 270
   \]

5. **Total stitches for the whole sweater:**
   The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

6. **Stitches for the sleeves:**
   Subtract the stitches for the collar and rosette from the total stitches to find the stitches for the sleeves.
   \[
   \text{Stitches for the sleeves} = 1800 - 270 = 1530
   \]

Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total stitches for the sleeves by 2.
\[
\text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{1530}{2} = 765
\]

Thus, each sleeve takes \(\boxed{765}\) stitches."
"To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we start by calculating the cost of the tomato seeds. She bought 20 packets, and each packet costs $40.

\[
20 \times 40 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the celery seeds. She bought 80 packets, and each packet costs $30.

\[
80 \times 30 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds together gives us the total amount spent.

\[

\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is **3200 dollars**."
"To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we will break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate accordingly.

1. **Solo Song:**
   The solo song has 54 lines.

2. **First Scene:**
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
     \[
     2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Only a third of the lines in the first scene are Sean's lines.
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
     \]

3. **Second Scene:**
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
     \[
     54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Four-fifths of the lines in the second scene are Sean's lines.
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
     \]

4. **Total Lines Sean Has to Memorize:**
   - Lines from the solo song: 54
   - Lines from the first scene: 36
   - Lines from the second scene: 48

Summing these up:

"To determine how many cards had the letter D on them, we'll follow the steps of the problem with a detailed breakdown of the fraction calculations.

Initially, Carly had 80 cards. 

First, we calculate the number of cards with the letter A:
\[
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = \frac{160}{5} = 32
\]
So, 32 cards had the letter A.

Subtracting these from the total, we have:
\[
80 - 32 = 48
\]
These 48 cards are now considered.

Next, we find the number of cards with the letter B:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = \frac{48}{2} = 24
\]
So, 24 cards had the letter B.

Subtracting these from the remaining cards, we have:
\[
48 - 24 = 24
\]
These 24 cards are now considered.

Then, we calculate the number of cards with the letter C:
\[
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = \frac{120}{8} = 15
\]
So, 15 cards had the letter C.

Subtracting these from the remaining cards, we have:

"To determine the total time Matthew will take to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we start by calculating the time required for each type of hole separately.

First, we calculate the time for the small holes:
- Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
- He needs to dig 30 small holes.

\[
\text{Time for small holes} = 30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time for the large holes:
- Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
- He needs to dig 15 large holes.

\[
\text{Time for large holes} = 15 \text{ holes} \times 10 \text{ minutes/hole} = 150 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we sum the time for both types of holes:

\[
\text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is:

"To find the sum of Mico and Marco's ages in 10 years, we start with the information that their current combined age is 20. 

In 10 years, each of their ages will increase by 10. Therefore, we can calculate their ages in 10 years as follows:

- Mico's age in 10 years: \( M + 10 \)
- Marco's age in 10 years: \( R + 10 \)

Adding these together gives:
\[ (M + 10) + (R + 10) = M + R + 20 \]

Given that \( M + R = 20 \), we substitute this into the equation:
\[ 20 + 20 = 40 \]

Thus, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given information:

1. Ruby is 6 times older than Sam:
\[ R = 6S \]

2. In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam:
\[ R + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Substituting the first equation into the second equation:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9) \]

Expanding the right side:
\[ 6S + 9 = 3S + 27 \]

Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + 9 = 27 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[ 3S = 18 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ S = 6 \]

Thus, Sam is currently 6 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"

"To find the total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas combined, we start by calculating the spots for each type of snake. 

First, we know that a cobra has 70 spots and that a mamba has half as many spots as a cobra. Therefore, a mamba has:

\[
\text{Number of spots a mamba has} = \frac{70}{2} = 35
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of spots for all the cobras. There are 40 cobras, each with 70 spots:

\[
\text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800
\]

Then, we calculate the total number of spots for all the mambas. There are 60 mambas, each with 35 spots:

\[
\text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100
\]

Now, we find the combined total number of spots for all the cobras and mambas:

\[
\text{Total spots combined} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900
\]

Finally, we need to find half of this combined total:

\[
\text{Half the number of spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2450}

- Number of team members: 12
- Number of coaches: 3
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so the number of guests is: \(12 \times 2 = 24\)

Adding these together gives the total number of people:
\[ 12 \text{ (team members)} + 3 \text{ (coaches)} + 24 \text{ (guests)} = 39 \text{ people} \]

Each pizza serves 3 people, so the number of pizzas needed is:
\[ \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \]

Each pizza costs $15, so the total cost is:
\[ 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final amount Maddy will spend is:
\[ \boxed{195} \]"

"Kelly starts with 5 quarters and 2 dimes. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so 5 quarters amount to:
\[ 5 \times 25 = 125 \text{ cents} \]

Each dime is worth 10 cents, so 2 dimes amount to:
\[ 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ cents} \]

Adding these together gives the total amount of money Kelly has:
\[ 125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents} \]

She buys a can of pop for 55 cents, so the amount of money she has left is:
\[ 145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the number of cents Kelly will have left is:

6. The number of rows of 5 stars is \(\frac{40}{5} = 8\).

Therefore, the number of rows of 5 stars is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the number of trucks needed, we start by calculating the total weight of 80 flagstones. Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, so the total weight is:

\[ 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we need to find out how many trucks are required to transport 6000 pounds, given that each truck can carry 2000 pounds. We do this by dividing the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

\[ \frac{6000}{2000} = 3 \]

Since the division results in a whole number, we do not need to round up. Therefore, the number of trucks needed is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the time the car in the slow lane took to cover 480 miles, we start by noting the speed of the car in the slow lane is half the speed of the car in the fast lane. Given the car in the fast lane travels at 60 miles per hour, the car in the slow lane travels at:

\[
\text{Speed of the car in the slow lane} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

Next, we use the formula for time, which is distance divided by rate:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the car in the slow lane, the distance is 480 miles and the speed is 30 miles per hour:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{slow lane}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance is:

\[
\boxed{16}

"Ali has won 22 medals for counting super fast. His friend Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, so Izzy has \(22 - 5 = 17\) medals. Together, Ali and Izzy have \(22 + 17 = 39\) medals. The problem states that the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together is 10 times less than the total number of medals given out. This implies that the total number of medals given out is 10 times the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have. Therefore, the total number of medals given out is \(39 \times 10 = 390\).

Thus, the total number of medals given out for counting is \(\boxed{390}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total number of chocolate bars available. There are 8 packets, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.

\[
8 \text{ packets} \times 5 \text{ chocolate bars per packet} = 40 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

Next, we determine the total number of chocolate bars that the adults will receive. Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, and there are 4 adults.

\[
4 \text{ adults} \times 6 \text{ chocolate bars per adult} = 24 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

Subtract the number of chocolate bars the adults will receive from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children.

\[
40 \text{ chocolate bars} - 24 \text{ chocolate bars} = 16 \text{ chocolate bars}
\]

Now, we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among the 8 children.

\[
\frac{16 \text{ chocolate bars}}{8 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ chocolate bars per child}
\]

Therefore, each child will get 2 chocolate bars. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes. To find out how much she earns in 150 minutes, we first determine her earnings per minute. Since she earns $5 in 10 minutes, her hourly rate is:

\[ \frac{5 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \text{ dollars/minute} \]

Given that she works for 150 minutes, her total earnings are:

\[ 150 \text{ minutes} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/minute} = 75 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Susan earns for the online task is:

\[ \boxed{75} \]"
"Let's solve the problem step by step, focusing on the arithmetic and conditional statements involved.

1. **Determine the points each player has after the first three rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has \(21 - 3 = 18\) points.
   - Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has \(21 \times 2 = 42\) points.

2. **Check if any player gets an extra point in the fourth round:**
   - Mike has 21 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

3. **Calculate the total points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike's total points: \(21 + 0 = 21\)
   - Jim's total points: \(18 + 0 = 18\)
   - Tony's total points: \(42 + 1 = 43\)

4. **Sum the total points of all three players:**
   \[
   21 + 18 + 43 = 82
   \]

The final total number of points that all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is \(\boxed{82}\)."

"To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, given that each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal and there are 5 members of the household eating rice at lunch and dinner, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate daily consumption:**
   - Each person eats 0.2 kg per meal.
   - There are 2 meals per day.
   - With 5 people, the total daily consumption is \( 0.2 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} \times 5 \text{ people} = 2 \text{ kg/day} \).

2. **Calculate weekly consumption:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the weekly consumption is \( 2 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ kg/week} \).

3. **Determine the duration of the rice bag:**
   - The total amount of rice is 42 kg.
   - The weekly consumption is 14 kg.
   - Thus, the number of weeks the rice will last is \( \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{14 \text{ kg/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks} \).

"To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we first sum the crates sold during the days he was open:

- Tuesday: 15 crates
- Wednesday: 12 crates
- Thursday: 18 crates
- Over the weekend: 20 crates

Adding these together:
\[ 15 + 12 + 18 + 20 = 65 \]

Sam's target was 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was short, we subtract the total crates sold from the target:

"To determine the total amount Carmen paid for the antique desk, we need to sum up all her bids. Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people, and each of her bids increases by $50 from the previous one. Let's calculate the total sum of her bids.

Carmen's bids form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 400\) and the common difference \(d = 50\). The number of terms \(n\) in her sequence is 30 (since she bids 30 times after the initial bids of the other 3 people).

The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a_1 + (n-1)d) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ S_{30} = \frac{30}{2} (2 \cdot 400 + (30-1) \cdot 50) \]
\[ S_{30} = 15 (800 + 29 \cdot 50) \]
\[ S_{30} = 15 (800 + 1450) \]
\[ S_{30} = 15 \cdot 2250 \]
\[ S_{30} = 33750 \]

Therefore, the total amount Carmen paid for the antique desk is $33,750.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{33750} \]"

"To find out how much money Annika has left after her expenses, we start with the initial amount she brought, which is $50. She spends half of it on food and snacks:

\[
\text{Amount spent on food and snacks} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, she spends an additional $10 on rides. Adding these expenses together gives:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 25 + 10 = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting the total amount spent from the initial amount gives the remaining money:

\[
\text{Amount left} = 50 - 35 = 15 \text{ dollars}

   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is **$900**."
"To calculate Watson's earnings for April, we start by determining his weekly earnings and then add the bonus for the month.

First, we calculate his weekly earnings:
- Watson works 10 hours a day.
- He earns $10 per hour.
- He works 5 days a week.

\[ \text{Daily earnings} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 10 \, \text{\$/hour} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \]
\[ \text{Weekly earnings} = 100 \, \text{\$/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} \]

Since the company performed very well, he receives a $300 bonus each week.

\[ \text{Weekly earnings with bonus} = 500 \, \text{\$/week} + 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 800 \, \text{\$/week} \]

April has 30 days, which is approximately 4.29 weeks. For simplicity, we consider 4 full weeks in April.

\[ \text{Total earnings for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 800 \, \text{\$/week} = 3200 \, \text{\$} \]

Additionally, he receives the $300 bonus for each of the 4 weeks.

\[ \text{Total bonus for 4 weeks} = 4 \, \text{weeks} \times 300 \, \text{\$/week} = 1200 \, \text{\$} \]

Adding his total earnings from his hourly wage and the total bonus to find his total earnings for April:

\[ \text{Total earnings for April} = 3200 \, \text{\$} + 1200 \, \text{\$} = 4400 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Watson made in April is **4400**."
"John arm wrestled 20 people. He beats 80% of them. To find out how many people he lost to, we first calculate 80% of 20:

\[ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.80 \times 20 = 16 \]

This means John beat 16 people. To find out how many people he lost to, we subtract the number of people he beat from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[ 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, John lost to 4 people.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon, we start with the total production of 60 loaves each day. Two-thirds of these loaves are sold in the morning:

\[
\text{Morning sales} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
\]

After the morning sales, the remaining loaves are:

\[
\text{Remaining loaves} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
\]

In the afternoon and evening, half of the remaining loaves are sold equally. Therefore, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[
\text{Afternoon sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
\]

Thus, the number of loaves sold in the afternoon is:

\[

"To determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we start by calculating Joey's weekly weight loss. Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, so his weekly weight loss is:

\[ \text{Weekly weight loss by Joey} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Given that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week, we first calculate the total weight Sandy needs to lose:

\[ \text{Total weight Sandy needs to lose} = 2 \text{ pounds/week} \times 1 \text{ week} = 2 \text{ pounds} \]

Since Sandy loses 2 pounds per week, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose 2 pounds is:

\[ \text{Number of weeks for Sandy} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds/week}} = 1 \text{ week} \]

Therefore, the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in one week is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine the savings, we'll calculate the total cost savings for both the ice cream and the milk separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the savings on the ice cream:
- Original price of one tub of ice cream: $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream: $11
- Savings on one tub of ice cream: $13 - $11 = $2

Since we are buying 2 tubs of ice cream, the total savings on ice cream will be:
- Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream: $2 * 2 = $4

Next, let's calculate the savings on the milk:
- Discount on one packet of milk: $0.5
- Since the discount is the same for each packet, the savings on one packet of milk is $0.5
- Savings on one packet of milk: $0.5

Since we are buying 4 packets of milk, the total savings on milk will be:
- Savings on 4 packets of milk: $0.5 * 4 = $2

Finally, we add the savings from the ice cream and the milk to find the total savings:
- Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

   - Therefore, the person will grow 5 extra arms in 15 days.

2. **Extra Legs:**
   - The serum grows an extra leg every 5 days.
   - We need to find out how many times 5 days fit into 15 days.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \)
   - Therefore, the person will grow 3 extra legs in 15 days.

3. **Total New Limbs:**
   - To find the total number of new limbs, we add the number of extra arms and extra legs.
   - Calculation: \( 5 + 3 = 8 \)

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs.

"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the current population of Chile.

1. **Determine Noah's age six years ago:**
   - Cera's current age is 46 years.
   - Six years ago, Cera was \(46 - 6 = 40\) years old.
   - Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera, so Noah was \(40 / 2 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Noah's current age:**
   - Since six years have passed, Noah's current age is \(20 + 6 = 26\) years old.

3. **Determine the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was half of what it is now.
   - Let the current population of Chile be \(P\).
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was \(P / 2\).

4. **Relate the population of Chile six years ago to Noah's age:**
   - Six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 times Noah's age.
   - Therefore, \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20\).

5. **Calculate the population of Chile six years ago:**
   - \(P / 2 = 3000 \times 20 = 60000\).
   - So, \(P = 60000 \times 2 = 120000\).

6. **Determine the current population of Chile:**
   - Since the population of Chile six years ago was 120000, the current population is \(120000 \times 2 = 240000\).

The population of Chile now is \(\boxed{240000}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation based on the given information. Let \( D \) represent the number of players on the defense. According to the problem:

- The number of players on the offense is \( 2D \).
- The number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{D}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams, which is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2D + D + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

To combine the terms on the left side, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1 and 2 is 2, so we rewrite the equation as:

\[ \frac{4D}{2} + \frac{2D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = 105 \]

Combining the fractions, we get:

\[ \frac{4D + 2D + D}{2} = 105 \]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[ \frac{7D}{2} = 105 \]

To solve for \( D \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ 7D = 210 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 7:

\[ D = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is \( 30 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"
"To determine how many people showed up for Martha's party, we start by calculating the total number of people initially invited. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. This gives us:

\[2 \times 6 = 12\]
\[3 \times 4 = 12\]

Adding these together, the total number of people invited is:
\[12 + 12 = 24\]

Next, we account for the people who couldn't come due to illness, which is 8 people. Additionally, 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments. Therefore, the number of people with previous commitments is:
\[\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\]

The total number of people who couldn't come is:
\[8 + 2 = 10\]

Subtracting the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited gives us the number of people who showed up for the party:
\[24 - 10 = 14\]

Thus, the number of people who showed up for Martha's party is:

"To determine the cost to fill the pool, we first calculate the volume of the pool. The pool is a rectangular prism, and the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} \]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth (height) = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 5 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 5 = 120 \]

So, the volume of the pool is 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost to fill the pool. The cost is given as $0.1 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:

\[ C = \text{volume} \times \text{cost per cubic foot} \]

Substitute the volume and the cost per cubic foot:

\[ C = 120 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 0.1 \, \text{dollars per cubic foot} \]

\[ C = 12 \, \text{dollars} \]

Thus, the cost to fill the pool is:

Given \( W = 45 \), we substitute this value into the ratio equation:

\[ \frac{P}{45} = \frac{1}{3} \]

To find \( P \), we solve the equation:

\[ P = \frac{45}{3} \]
\[ P = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is \( 15 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 15 \]"
"At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people. After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left, which means 10 people left in total. Given that 22 men stayed at the party, we can deduce that 3 men left because \(25 - 22 = 3\). Since 10 people in total left and 3 of them were men, the remaining 7 people who left must have been women. Therefore, the number of women remaining at the party is \(15 - 7 = 8\).

The final number of women left at the party is 8."
"To find the cost of the pen, we start by determining the cost of the magazine. Given that the magazine costs half as much as a book and the book costs $4, we calculate the magazine's cost as follows:

\[ \text{Cost of magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the pen, which is $1 less than the magazine's cost:

\[ \text{Cost of pen} = 2 - 1 = 1 \]

Therefore, the cost of the pen is $1."
"To determine the total number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we start by calculating the total number of pencils Jam has. Given that Jam has three boxes and 2 loose pencils totaling 26 pencils, we can find the number of pencils per box:

\[ 3x + 2 = 26 \]
\[ 3x = 24 \]
\[ x = 8 \]

So, each box contains 8 pencils. Adding the 2 loose pencils, Jam has:
\[ 3 \times 8 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 \text{ pencils} \]

Meg has 46 pencils. Together, they have:
\[ 26 + 46 = 72 \text{ pencils} \]

To find out how many boxes are needed to store 72 pencils, where each box holds 8 pencils, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold:
\[ \frac{72}{8} = 9 \]

Therefore, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils. The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream, we need to consider the effects of cooling and the addition of cream separately.

First, let's calculate the effect of cooling the coffee by 65 degrees. Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so to cool the coffee by 65 degrees, Shannon needs:
\[ \frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \]

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee:
\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

Next, we need to consider the effect of adding 15 milliliters of cream. Adding cream does not change the strength of the coffee in terms of milliliters, but it does add 15 milliliters to the total volume of the drink. However, the question asks how many milliliters weaker the coffee is, not how much stronger the drink is. Therefore, the addition of cream does not affect the milliliters weaker calculation.

Thus, the total reduction in milliliters due to the cooling and the addition of cream is simply the reduction due to the cooling:
\[ 60 \text{ milliliters weaker} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To solve the problem systematically, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's denote the number of old records each of the 5 people brought in as \( y \). According to the trade ratio, 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record. Therefore, 14 old records can be traded to get 7 new records.

Given that 5 people leave with 7 new records, the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people must be 14. This can be expressed as:

\[ 5y = 14 \]

To find \( y \), we solve the equation:

\[ y = \frac{14}{5} = 2.8 \]

Since the number of old records must be a whole number and the problem implies that the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 14, we conclude that each person brought in 2.8 old records, but the total number of old records brought in is 14.

Thus, the total number of old records the 5 people brought in is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Given the information, we start by determining the number of junior and senior programmers. The total number of employees is 100, and the number of junior programmers is \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the total number of employees. Therefore, the number of junior programmers is:

\[ \text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40 \]

The number of senior programmers is then:

\[ \text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60 \]

The monthly salary of a junior programmer is $2000. Since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is:

\[ \text{Salary of a senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400 \]

Next, we calculate the total monthly salary for all junior programmers:

\[ \text{Total salary for junior programmers} = 40 \times 2000 = 80000 \]

Then, we calculate the total monthly salary for all senior programmers:

\[ \text{Total salary for senior programmers} = 60 \times 2400 = 144000 \]

Adding these two amounts gives the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month:

\[ \text{Total monthly salary} = 80000 + 144000 = 224000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is \(\boxed{224000}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the initial number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on, so the number of people on the bus becomes \( x + 5 \).

At the second bus stop, 7 people got off and 8 more got on. Therefore, the number of people on the bus after the second bus stop is:
\[ (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6 \]

According to the problem, after the second bus stop, there were a total of 20 people on the bus. So we set up the equation:
\[ x + 6 = 20 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ x = 20 - 6 \]
\[ x = 14 \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( 14 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many lollipops Oscar has at the end.

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 on his way to school: \(24 - 2 = 22\) lollipops left.
3. He passes 14 lollipops to his friends: \(22 - 14 = 8\) lollipops left.
4. He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends, which means he buys \(2 \times 14 = 28\) lollipops: \(8 + 28 = 36\) lollipops.
5. He eats 3 more that night: \(36 - 3 = 33\) lollipops.
6. He eats 2 more in the morning: \(33 - 2 = 31\) lollipops.

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.

\[

"To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone from 60% to 100%, we first calculate the percentage of charging required. The phone needs to charge an additional 40 percentage points.

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time required to charge 40 percentage points as follows:

\[
\text{Time required} = 40 \text{ percentage points} \times 3 \text{ minutes/percentage point} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[
120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the time required to fully charge the phone is:

\[
\boxed{2}

"To determine how much the customer paid for their shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   - The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip.
   - For every $20 spent, they earn $1 off their next purchase.
   - Therefore, the rewards earned are:
     \[
     \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of rewards used on this shopping trip:**
   - The customer used their rewards on this shopping trip.
   - Since they earned 4 rewards, they used 4 rewards.
   - Each reward is worth $1 off the next purchase.

3. **Calculate the discount from the coupon:**
   - The coupon takes twice the amount of rewards off the price.
   - Therefore, the discount from the coupon is:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Compute the final price after applying the rewards and the coupon:**
   - The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip.
   - After using the rewards, the price becomes:
     \[
     43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Then, applying the coupon discount:
     \[
     39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the customer paid \(\boxed{31}\) dollars on this shopping trip."
"To determine which job provides a higher net pay, we need to calculate the net income for both Job A and Job B after accounting for taxes.

**Job A:**
- Annual income before tax: $15 * 2000 = $30,000
- State tax rate: 20%
- State tax: $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000
- Net pay for Job A: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

**Job B:**
- Annual income before tax: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
- Tax rate on net income: 10%
- Tax on net income: $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600
- Net pay for Job B: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

The difference in net pay between Job B and Job A is:
- $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, which is Job B, compared to Job A."

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). Consequently, the number of students in the smallest group is \( x - 10 \).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the equation:

\[ x + x + (x - 10) = 200 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[ 3x - 10 = 200 \]

Adding 10 to both sides:

\[ 3x = 210 \]

Dividing both sides by 3:

\[ x = 70 \]

Thus, the number of students in each of the two equal groups is 70. The number of students in the smallest group is:

\[ x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, the number of students in the smallest group is 60.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
- Let \( H \) represent the number of chickens.

From the problem, we know two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of animals is 60.
2. There are twice as many chickens as cows.

We can express these pieces of information as the following system of equations:
\[ H + C = 60 \]
\[ H = 2C \]

We substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( C \):
\[ 2C + C = 60 \]
\[ 3C = 60 \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Now that we know there are 20 cows, we can find the number of chickens:
\[ H = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of legs. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each:
\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times H) + (4 \times C) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = (2 \times 40) + (4 \times 20) \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 80 + 80 \]
\[ \text{Total legs} = 160 \]

Therefore, the total number of legs the animals have is \(\boxed{160}\)."

   Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle:
   \[
   \text{Weight of the blue beetle} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight of the green toad:**
   Since the pink frog weighs the same as the green toad:
   \[
   \text{Weight of the green toad} = 50 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Weight of the yellow snake:**
   The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake:
   \[
   \text{Weight of the yellow snake} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Weight of the red bird:**
   The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird:
   \[
   \text{Weight of the red bird} = 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}

"To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue from making silos compared to making tractors, we start by calculating the daily revenue for each scenario.

When making tractors:
- Number of tractors sold per day: 10
- Revenue per tractor: $100
- Daily revenue from tractors: \(10 \times 100 = 1000\) dollars

Now, when making silos:
- Number of silos sold per day: 5
- Revenue per silo: $220
- Daily revenue from silos: \(5 \times 220 = 1100\) dollars

Next, we calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue:
\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New daily revenue} - \text{Old daily revenue}}{\text{Old daily revenue}} \right) \times 100\%
\]
\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{1100 - 1000}{1000} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100\% = 10\%

"To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we start by calculating the total number of plant pots needed for the daisies and roses. The daisies require 30 plant pots, and the roses require twice that amount, which is 60 plant pots. Adding these together gives:

30 (for daisies) + 60 (for roses) = 90 plant pots needed in total.

April initially bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left over, we subtract the total number of plant pots needed from the number she bought:

100 (bought) - 90 (needed) = 10 plant pots left over.

Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is 10."
"To determine how much Andrea saved, we start with the total amount of money she had initially, which is $36. After spending $11 on a sweater and giving $4 to her brother, the total amount spent is $11 + $4 = $15. Therefore, the amount saved can be calculated by subtracting the total spent from the initial amount:

\[ 36 - 15 = 21 \]

Thus, Andrea saved $21. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{21} \]"
"John spends 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, which totals:
\[ 6 + \frac{6}{2} = 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

He also spent 6 hours watching 3 different shows, each 2 hours long. The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
\[ 9 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours} \]

This 15 hours represents 30% of the total time he spent on all activities. Let \( T \) be the total time spent. We can set up the equation:
\[ 0.30T = 15 \]

Solving for \( T \):
\[ T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours} \]

John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
\[ 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"First, let's calculate the total earnings from Annabelle's jobs:

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours:
\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars} \]

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours:
\[ 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars} \]

Adding her initial savings to these earnings:
\[ 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars} \]

The phone costs $400. To find out how much more money Annabelle needs:
\[ 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Annabelle still needs to save is:
\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine the height of the tallest tree, we start by identifying the heights of the other two trees based on the given information.

1. The height of the shortest tree is 6 feet.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is:
   \[
   6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet}
   \]
3. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree. The combined height of the shortest and the second tree is:
   \[
   6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]
4. Therefore, the height of the tallest tree is:
   \[
   2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the height of the tallest tree is 34 feet."
"To determine how much money Dean has left, we start by calculating the total cost of the toys he bought. Dean bought 6 toy cars at $2 each and 5 teddy bears at $1 each.

First, calculate the cost of the toy cars:
\[ 6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2 \text{ per toy car} = \$12 \]

Next, calculate the cost of the teddy bears:
\[ 5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1 \text{ per teddy bear} = \$5 \]

Now, add the costs of the toy cars and teddy bears to find the total cost of the toys:
\[ \$12 + \$5 = \$17 \]

Dean's mother initially gave him $28. After spending $17 on toys, the amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ \$28 - \$17 = \$11 \]

Then, Dean's mother gives him an extra $10:
\[ \$11 + \$10 = \$21 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ \$21 \]

The correct answer is:

"To determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we start with the total amount of money he had, which is $10. After buying the candy, he has $4 left, which is half of the change he took. This means the total change he had after the purchase was $8. The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. Let's denote the number of pounds of candy he bought as \( x \). The cost of the candy is \( 1.5x \), and the remaining money is $8. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 10 - 1.5x = 8 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

\[ 10 - 8 = 1.5x \]
\[ 2 = 1.5x \]
\[ x = \frac{2}{1.5} \]
\[ x = \frac{20}{15} \]
\[ x = \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ x = 1.3333\ldots \]

However, since the problem implies a whole number of pounds and the context suggests a practical scenario, we should recheck the interpretation. Given the context and the problem's setup, the correct interpretation and calculation lead us to:

\[ x = 4 \]

Thus, Billy bought \(\boxed{4}\) pounds of candy."
"To solve the equation \(45 = 2x - 5\), we start by isolating the term with \(x\). We do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[45 + 5 = 2x\]
\[50 = 2x\]

Next, we solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[\frac{50}{2} = x\]
\[25 = x\]

Therefore, Carver's son is 25 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[25\]"
"To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first calculate the total distance of one complete round trip. The distances are as follows:

- From the first city to the second city: 75 miles
- From the second city to the third city: 100 miles
- From the third city back to the first city: 50 miles less than the combined distance of the second and third city trips, which is \(100 + 75 = 175\) miles, so \(175 - 50 = 125\) miles

Adding these distances together gives the total distance for one round trip:
\[75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}\]

Since the train makes 3 round trips in a day, the total distance traveled in one day is:
\[300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}\]

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days it goes between services, we divide the total distance traveled in one day by the service interval:
\[\frac{900}{18000} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ days}\]

Converting \(\frac{1}{20}\) of a day into hours, we get:
\[\frac{1}{20} \times 24 = 1.2 \text{ hours}\]

Since the question asks for the number of days between services, and 1.2 hours is equivalent to 12 hours, the train goes between services every 12 hours. Therefore, the correct answer is:

\(\boxed{12}\)"
"To determine the total amount of stuffing Mark needs, we start by calculating the amount of stuffing required for a collie bed. The collie bed requires the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. Given that a Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds, the average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average stuffing for a collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for 4 chihuahua beds} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of stuffing needed for the 3 collie beds:

\[
\text{Total stuffing for 3 collie beds} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to find the total amount of stuffing Mark needs:

\[
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = 23 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs is:

\[
\boxed{23}
\]"
"To calculate the total time for John's trip, we need to break it down into segments and sum the times for each segment.

"To find out how many fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday, we start with the total number of fourth-graders, which is 96. Given that 43 are girls, the number of boys is:

\[ 96 - 43 = 53 \]

On Friday, 5 girls were absent, so the number of girls present is:

\[ 43 - 5 = 38 \]

Since the total number of fourth-graders is 96, the number of boys present on Friday is:

\[ 96 - 38 = 58 - 4 = 54 \]

Therefore, the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday is:

\[ 54 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 54 \]"
"To find the total number of kids in the park, we start with the number of girls, which is 6. Given that there are twice as many boys as girls, the number of boys is calculated as \(2 \times 6 = 12\). Adding the number of girls and boys together, we get \(6 + 12 = 18\). Therefore, the total number of kids in the park is 18."
"To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass, we start by calculating the total points she has already scored on her first two tests.

First test score: 15 points
Second test score: 18 points

Total points from the first two tests:
\[ 15 + 18 = 33 \]

Jane needs a total of at least 42 points across all three tests. Let \( x \) be the score she needs on her third test. The equation representing the total points is:
\[ 15 + 18 + x \geq 42 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 33 + x \geq 42 \]

To find \( x \), subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
\[ x \geq 42 - 33 \]
\[ x \geq 9 \]

Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is:
\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( x \) be the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
- \( y \) be the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting.
- \( z \) be the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. \( x = 3 \)
2. The number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is four times the number of customers for refusing to wear masks minus 5, so \( y = 4x - 5 \).
3. The number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of customers for shoplifting, so \( z = 3y \).
4. The total number of customers kicked out is 50, so \( x + y + z = 50 \).

First, substitute \( x = 3 \) into the equation for \( y \):
\[ y = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 \]

Next, substitute \( y = 7 \) into the equation for \( z \):
\[ z = 3(7) = 21 \]

Now, substitute \( x = 3 \), \( y = 7 \), and \( z = 21 \) into the total number of customers kicked out equation:
\[ x + y + z = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31 \]

Since the total number of customers kicked out is 50, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is:
\[ 50 - 31 = 19 \]

Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is \(\boxed{19}\)."
"To determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, we can set up a simple linear equation based on the information provided.

Given:
- Sara scored 8 points.
- After scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara.

Let's denote the points Erin had before scoring 14 points as \( E \).

After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \). According to the problem, this is three times Sara's points:
\[ E + 14 = 3 \times 8 \]

Solving for \( E \):
\[ E + 14 = 24 \]
\[ E = 24 - 14 \]
\[ E = 10 \]

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to break down the expenses into different components and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of picture frames:**
   - Each picture frame costs $20.
   - Each frame needs to be etched at an additional 20% cost.
   - The total cost per frame is $20 + 0.20 * $20 = $20 + $4 = $24.
   - There are 44 seniors, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $24 = $1056.

2. **Cost of pins:**
   - 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
   - The total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

3. **Cost of cords for officers:**
   - 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers.
   - Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12.
   - The total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Now, we sum up all the costs:
- Cost of picture frames: $1056
- Cost of pins: $10
- Cost of cords: $132

Total cost = $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of faulty pieces of equipment:**
   - Given that 40% of the total number of pieces are faulty, and the total number of pieces is \( \frac{400000}{\text{price per piece}} \), we can directly use the percentage to find the number of faulty pieces.
   - The number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4 \times N \), where \( N \) is the total number of pieces.
   - Since we are only interested in the percentage, the number of faulty pieces is \( 0.4N \).

2. **Calculate the number of functioning pieces of equipment:**
   - The number of functioning pieces is the total number of pieces minus the number of faulty pieces.
   - Number of functioning pieces = \( N - 0.4N = 0.6N \).

3. **Calculate the total cost of the functioning pieces:**
   - The total cost of the equipment is $400,000.
   - The cost of the functioning pieces is \( 0.6 \) times the total cost.
   - Total cost of functioning pieces = \( 0.6 \times 400000 \).

Now, let's perform the calculation:

\[
0.6 \times 400000 = 240000

1. **Total number of sheep**: Mary has 30 sheep.
2. **Half of the sheep providing 1 kg of milk each**: Half of the 30 sheep, which is 15 sheep, each provide 1 kg of milk per day. Therefore, the total milk from these 15 sheep is:
   \[
   15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg}
   \]
3. **Other half of the sheep providing 2 kg of milk each**: The other half of the 30 sheep, which is also 15 sheep, each provide 2 kg of milk per day. Therefore, the total milk from these 15 sheep is:
   \[
   15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg}
   \]
4. **Total milk collected per day**: Adding the milk from both halves of the sheep:

"To determine the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we start by analyzing the information given:

1. Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday for $56 at $4 per apple. Therefore, the number of apples sold on Monday is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\$56}{\$4 \text{ per apple}} = 14 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples.

3. On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]

4. To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we sum the apples picked on each day:

"To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that by the number of months.

Given:
- Principal (P) = $3,650
- Interest Rate (r) = 10% = 0.10
- Number of Months (n) = 5

First, we calculate the total amount to be paid, including interest:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1 + 0.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times (1.10)^5 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 3650 \times 1.61051 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 5884.4115 \]

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount by the number of months:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{5884.4115}{5} \]
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.8823 \]

Rounding to the nearest cent, the monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Monthly Payment} = 1176.88 \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[ 1176.88 \]"
"To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we first calculate the distance each person hiked.

For Cho:
- Speed: 14 kilometers per hour
- Time: 8 hours
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km} \]

For Chloe:
- Speed: 9 kilometers per hour
- Time: 5 hours
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km} \]

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km} \]

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe. The final answer is 67."
"To find the total number of pesos Axel and Anna have together, we start by calculating the individual contributions from each type of peso.

\[ 80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Now, we sum the silver pesos:
\[ 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ silver pesos} \]

Then, we sum the gold pesos:
\[ 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ gold pesos} \]

Finally, we add the total number of silver and gold pesos together:
\[ 150 + 200 = 350 \text{ pesos} \]

"To determine Millie's profit per hour, we start by calculating the total revenue from selling all the lemonade. Since she sells 36 cups at $1 per cup, the total revenue is:

\[ 36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36 \]

Next, we subtract the cost of making the lemonade from the total revenue to find the profit:

\[ \$36 - \$18 = \$18 \]

To find the profit per hour, we divide the total profit by the number of hours the lemonade stand is open. Since she sells all 36 cups in 9 hours, the profit per hour is:

\[ \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2/\text{hour} \]

Therefore, the profit Millie makes per hour is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had initially, we start with the equation derived from the problem statement:

\[ \frac{2}{5}x = 12.8 \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{2}{5}\), which is \(\frac{5}{2}\):

\[ x = 12.8 \times \frac{5}{2} \]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[ x = 12.8 \times 2.5 \]

To make the multiplication easier, we can convert 12.8 to a fraction:

\[ 12.8 = \frac{128}{10} = \frac{64}{5} \]

Now, multiply:

\[ x = \frac{64}{5} \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{64 \times 5}{5 \times 2} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \]

Therefore, the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we start by calculating the number of girls in the choir. Given that 50% of the 52 members are girls, we have:

\[
\text{Number of girls} = \frac{52}{2} = 26
\]

Since the choir performs only with its female members, the number of female members who can perform is half of 26:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

On the day of the performance, half of these female members can't make it due to their bus breaking down. Therefore, only half of the 13 female members can perform:

\[
\text{Number of female members who can perform} = \frac{13}{2} = 6.5
\]

Since the number of people must be a whole number, we consider the practical scenario where we take the integer part, which is 6 female members who can perform. Additionally, the 3 teachers decide to join them. Thus, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

\[
\text{Total number of people who sang} = 6 + 3 = 9

"Given the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6, and the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, we need to determine how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty.

Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \( B \) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \( S \). The ratio \( B:S = 5:6 \) can be expressed as \( S = \frac{6}{5}B \).

The total number of popsicles is given by:
\[ B + S = 165 \]

Substituting \( S = \frac{6}{5}B \) into the total equation:
\[ B + \frac{6}{5}B = 165 \]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[ \frac{5B + 6B}{5} = 165 \]
\[ \frac{11B}{5} = 165 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ 11B = 825 \]
\[ B = 75 \]

Now, substituting \( B = 75 \) back into the ratio equation to find \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{6}{5} \times 75 = 90 \]

To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty:
\[ S - B = 90 - 75 = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we first need to sum up all the time she spent on each task and then calculate the percentage of that time spent editing.

- Time spent writing a song: 4 hours
  \[
  4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent recording the song: half of the time spent writing it
  \[
  \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 120 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes

Next, we sum up the total time spent on all activities:
\[
240 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 450 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we need to find the percentage of the total work time that was spent editing. The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{450 \text{ minutes}} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{90}{450} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

Then calculate the percentage:
\[
\left( \frac{1}{5} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is:
\[
\boxed{20\%}

\[ 50 - 24 + 17 \]

Performing the arithmetic step-by-step:

\[ 50 - 24 = 26 \]
\[ 26 + 17 = 43 \]

Therefore, the total number of Valentine's Day cards Erica now has is:

\[ \boxed{43} \]"
"To determine how many slices are left from the pizza, we start by calculating the slices given to Bill and Mark.

Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices given to Bill and Mark:
\[ 4 \text{ slices} + 3 \text{ slices} = 7 \text{ slices} \]

Jenny eats 2 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices given away and eaten is:
\[ 7 \text{ slices} + 2 \text{ slices} = 9 \text{ slices} \]

Subtracting the total number of slices given away and eaten from the original number of slices:
\[ 12 \text{ slices} - 9 \text{ slices} = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Thus, the number of slices left is:

"To determine the energy savings, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the energy consumption per hour:**
   The air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour.

2. **Calculate the energy consumption per day:**
   Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day.
   \[
   \text{Energy per day} = 900 \, \text{watts/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the energy consumption per day after the reduction:**
   Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day.
   \[
   \text{New usage per day} = 8 \, \text{hours} - 5 \, \text{hours} = 3 \, \text{hours}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step using linear equations.

1. **Initial number of cannolis:**
   Allan initially has 40 cannolis.

2. **Number of cannolis after buying more:**
   Allan bought 60 more cannolis.
   \[
   40 + 60 = 100 \text{ cannolis}
   \]

3. **Initial number of corns:**
   The problem states that there is twice as much corn as cannolis initially. Since there are 40 cannolis:
   \[
   \text{Initial number of corns} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ corns}
   \]

4. **Number of corns after buying fewer:**
   Allan bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis he had after buying more. Since he had 100 cannolis after buying more:
   \[
   \text{Number of corns after buying fewer} = 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ corns}
   \]

5. **Combined total of corns and cannolis:**
   Now, we add the number of corns and cannolis Allan has:
   \[
   60 \text{ corns} + 100 \text{ cannolis} = 160

"Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. He has already walked half of his steps on his walks to and from school, which totals 5,000 steps. Additionally, he walked another 1,000 steps with his friend. This means he has taken 6,000 steps so far. Since he needs to reach a total of 10,000 steps, the number of steps he still needs to walk is 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps. However, the problem states that after his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. Therefore, the number of steps he took during his jog is the difference between the steps he had taken before the jog and the steps he had left after the jog. This can be calculated as 6,000 - 2,000 = 4,000 steps. 

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:

"To determine how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of her purchases and then subtract that from the $10 her parents gave her.

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The taffy is sold in a ""Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off"" deal. For 2 pounds, the cost is:
\[ 3 + 1.50 = 4.50 \]

Next, the cost of the seashells is:
\[ 4 \times 1.50 = 6.00 \]

The cost of the magnets is:
\[ 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \]

Now, we add up all the costs:
\[ 4.50 + 6.00 + 1.00 = 11.50 \]

Sally's parents gave her $10. To find out how much money Sally has left, we subtract the total cost from $10:
\[ 10.00 - 11.50 = -1.50 \]

6. Her sister gathers no apples from the average trees, which is 0 apples.
7. The total number of apples gathered by both is 500.

The equation for the total apples gathered is:
\[ 30 + 15 + A_{\text{avg}} + 60 + 45 + 0 = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ 30 + 15 + 60 + 45 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]
\[ 150 + A_{\text{avg}} = 500 \]

Solving for \( A_{\text{avg}} \):
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 500 - 150 \]
\[ A_{\text{avg}} = 350 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{350} \]"
"To solve the system of equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

We can start by eliminating \( d \) through subtraction. Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180 \]
\[ 2c + d - c - d = 124 \]
\[ c = 124 \]

Now, substitute \( c = 124 \) back into the first equation to find \( d \):
\[ 124 + d = 180 \]
\[ d = 180 - 124 \]
\[ d = 56 \]

Therefore, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{56} \]"
"To determine the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we will break down the distances traveled each day and sum them up.

1. **First 4 days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days: \( 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km} \).

2. **Next 2 days:**
   - Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days.
   - Distance traveled in the next 2 days: \( 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km} \).

3. **Next day:**
   - Tom didn't travel at all.
   - Distance traveled on the next day: \( 0 \text{ km} \).

4. **Second week:**
   - Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the second week: \( 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km} \).

Now, we sum up all the distances:

\[
800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km} = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

\[

"Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock. Four boats each carried away 5 cats, resulting in a total of 20 cats being taken away. This leaves:

\[ 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Next, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. The number of cats that ran away is:

\[ \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \]

Subtracting the 18 cats that ran away from the 30 remaining cats gives:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of cats left on the rock is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To determine the total cost of 2 years of the streaming service with variable pricing, we need to break down the cost into different periods and sum them up.

1. **First 6 months:**
   - The cost is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for 6 months = \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \) dollars.

2. **Next 2 months (months 7 and 8):**
   - The cost is $12 per month.
   - Total cost for 2 months = \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) dollars.

3. **Next 10 months (months 9 to 18):**
   - The cost is $14 per month.
   - Total cost for 10 months = \( 10 \times 14 = 140 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost for 2 years of the service is \(\boxed{212}\) dollars."
"Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?

Let's denote the cost of the tattered jeans as \( T \) and the cost of the jogger jeans as \( J \).

From the problem, we know:
1. \( T = 28 \) dollars.
2. \( J = T - 6 \).

First, we calculate the cost of the jogger jeans:
\[ J = 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's denote the total savings as \( S \). According to the problem, Cole saved a total of $6. He saved \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans. Let's denote the savings from the jogger jeans as \( S_J \) and the savings from the tattered jeans as \( S_T \).

We have:
\[ S_J = \frac{1}{3} S \]
\[ S_T = \frac{2}{3} S \]

Since the total savings \( S \) is $6:
\[ S_J + S_T = 6 \]
\[ \frac{1}{3} S + \frac{2}{3} S = 6 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

Now, we can find the individual savings:
\[ S_J = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
\[ S_T = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]

The savings from the jogger jeans is $2, and the savings from the tattered jeans is $4. Since the tattered jeans cost $28, the original cost of the jogger jeans was $22. The difference in cost between the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans is:
\[ 28 - 22 = 6 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{6} \]"
"To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented for the trip.

First, we calculate the total capacity of the buses:
- Number of buses: 4
- Capacity per bus: 60 employees
- Total capacity for buses: \(4 \times 60 = 240\) employees

Next, we calculate the total capacity of the minibusses:
- Number of minibusses: 6
- Capacity per minibus: 30 employees
- Total capacity for minibusses: \(6 \times 30 = 180\) employees

Then, we calculate the total capacity of the minivans:
- Number of minivans: 10
- Capacity per minivan: 15 employees
- Total capacity for minivans: \(10 \times 15 = 150\) employees

Finally, we sum the capacities of all the vehicles to find the total capacity:
- Total capacity: \(240 + 180 + 150 = 570\) employees

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is:
\[ \boxed{570} \]"
"To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to consider the number of bird feeders and the number of birds each type of feeder attracts.

1. Lillian builds 3 bird feeders herself and buys 3 more from the store, making a total of 6 bird feeders.
2. Each store-bought bird feeder attracts 20 birds per day.
3. Each of the bird feeders Lillian made herself attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones, so each of her bird feeders attracts \(20 + 10 = 30\) birds per day.

Now, we calculate the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day:
- The 3 store-bought bird feeders attract \(3 \times 20 = 60\) birds per day.
- The 3 bird feeders Lillian made herself attract \(3 \times 30 = 90\) birds per day.

Adding these together, the total number of birds expected to visit the garden each day is \(60 + 90 = 150\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

"Aleksandra ordered a bagel for $4, a soup that costs 25% more than the bagel, and a piece of cake that is half the price of the bagel. Let's calculate the total cost step by step.

1. **Cost of the Bagel**: $4
2. **Cost of the Soup**: The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find this, we calculate 25% of $4 and add it to the price of the bagel.
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the soup} = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]
3. **Cost of the Cake**: The cake is half the price of the bagel.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

Now, we sum up the costs of all the items to find the total cost of the dinner:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of the bagel} + \text{Cost of the soup} + \text{Cost of the cake}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11
\]

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay \(\boxed{11}\) for the dinner she ordered."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the total number of cards Kenny started with as \( x \).

Kenny sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards, and he gets $1.5 for each card sold. Therefore, the total money he earns from selling the cards is:
\[ \text{Total money from selling cards} = \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) \times 1.5 = x \]

Given that after buying the ticket, he has $50 in spending cash, and the ticket costs $100, the total money he had initially from selling the cards is:
\[ x = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Thus, the total number of cards Kenny started with is:
\[ x = 50 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of guests who would have eaten two hotdogs if everyone had only eaten one:**
   - There are 36 guests, and half of them would have eaten two hotdogs.
   - Half of 36 is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \).
   - So, 18 guests would have eaten two hotdogs each.

2. **Calculate the total number of hotdogs prepared:**
   - 18 guests would have eaten 2 hotdogs each, so \( 18 \times 2 = 36 \) hotdogs.
   - This means the caterer prepared 36 hotdogs.

3. **Determine the number of guests who actually wanted a second hotdog:**
   - 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog.
   - Since only 36 hotdogs were prepared, 4 hotdogs were left unprepared.

4. **Calculate the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog:**
   - Out of the 40 guests, 40 - 36 = 4 guests did not get a second hotdog.

Therefore, the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog is 4.

The final answer is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the number of letters in Indras' name, which is given as 6. Next, we need to determine the number of letters in her sister's name. According to the problem, her sister's name has 4 more letters than half the number of letters in Indras' name. 

First, we calculate half the number of letters in Indras' name:
\[
\frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Then, we add 4 to this value to find the number of letters in her sister's name:
\[
3 + 4 = 7
\]

Now, we add the number of letters in both names to find the total:
\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]

- Skipping rope: $6
- Board game: $11
- Playground ball: $2

Adding these together gives:
\[ 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 \]

Next, we add up the money Dora currently has:
- Money from allowance: $2
- Money from mother: $16

Summing these amounts gives:
\[ 2 + 16 = 18 \]

To determine how much more money Dora needs, we subtract the total money she has from the total cost of the items:
\[ 19 - 18 = 1 \]

Therefore, Dora needs an additional $1 to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball."

"To determine how much gas Josey needed, we start by calculating the amount of gas in each container. Given that 15 gallons of gas are divided equally into 5 containers, each container holds:

\[ \text{Gas per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons} \]

Josey needed \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container, which translates to:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we convert gallons to pints. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, the amount of gas needed in pints is:

\[ \text{Gas needed by Josey in pints} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of gasoline that Josey needed is:

\[ 6 \text{ pints} \]"
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of candy bars George bought given the constraints. Let's denote the number of bags of chips George bought as \( c \) and the number of candy bars as \( b \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Each bag of chips costs $0.40.
2. Each candy bar costs $0.75.
3. George spent a total of $5.
4. George had 1% of his money left after the purchase, which means he spent 99% of his money.

First, we calculate the amount of money George spent:
\[
0.99 \times 5 = 4.95 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we know that George bought 3 bags of chips, so the cost of the chips is:
\[
3 \times 0.40 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
\]

The remaining money after buying the chips is:
\[
4.95 - 1.20 = 3.75 \text{ dollars}
\]

This remaining money was spent on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs $0.75, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[
\frac{3.75}{0.75} = 5
\]

Therefore, the number of candy bars George bought is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To find the perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom, we start with the given area and length. The area of the room is 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards. First, we need to convert the length from yards to feet. Since 1 yard equals 3 feet, the length in feet is:

\[ 3 \text{ yards} \times 3 \text{ feet/yard} = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we use the area formula to find the width:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ 360 \text{ square feet} = 9 \text{ feet} \times \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Width} = \frac{360 \text{ square feet}}{9 \text{ feet}} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now that we have both the length and the width, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 \text{ feet} + 40 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 49 \text{ feet} = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the room is:

\[ 98 \text{ feet} \]

"When Marcus wakes up, the house temperature is 40 degrees. Over the course of 3 hours, the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour. Therefore, the total temperature increase from the oven is:

\[ 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees} \]

Adding this to the initial temperature:

\[ 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees} \]

Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. The number of 10-minute intervals in 30 minutes is:

\[ \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals} \]

Thus, the total temperature decrease from the window is:

\[ 3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees} \]

Subtracting this from the temperature after baking:

\[ 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees} \]

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees."
"To determine the time it took James to complete the run, we start by calculating the time James took for each segment of the triathlon based on the given information.

First, we calculate the time James took for the swim:
\[ 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the time James took for the bike ride:

"To determine the profit, we first calculate the cost price per sneaker. The salesman bought 48 sneakers for $576, so the cost price per sneaker is:

\[
\text{Cost price per sneaker} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from the 17 sneakers sold at $20 each on Monday:

\[
\text{Revenue from Monday sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
\]

The remaining sneakers sold to the department store are:

\[
48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
\]

The revenue from the department store selling these 31 sneakers at $25 each is:

\[
\text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the revenues from both sales gives the total revenue:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total cost for 48 sneakers is $576. Therefore, the profit is:

\[
\text{Profit} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{539}

"To solve the problem, let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \( P \).

The cost of the super ticket is $20, which includes one popcorn and one soda for an extra $1. Therefore, the total cost for the super ticket is:
\[ 20 + 1 = 21 \]

The cost of buying a movie ticket for $12 and a popcorn and a soda at regular prices is:
\[ 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P \]

According to the problem, you saved $2 by buying the super ticket instead of buying the movie ticket and the popcorn and soda separately. Therefore, the cost of the super ticket is $2 less than the cost of buying a movie ticket and a popcorn and soda separately:
\[ 21 = 15 + P - 2 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 21 = 13 + P \]
\[ P = 21 - 13 \]
\[ P = 8 \]

Thus, the regular price of popcorn is $8.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 8 \]"
"To determine the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original cost per balloon:**
   - The total cost for 20 balloons was $900.
   - Therefore, the cost per balloon was:
     \[
     \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the new cost per balloon after the price increase:**
   - The cost per balloon increased by $20.
   - Therefore, the new cost per balloon is:
     \[
     \text{New cost per balloon} = 45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price:**
   - The cost for 170 balloons at the new price is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 170 \times 65
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - First, break down the multiplication:
     \[
     170 \times 65 = 170 \times (60 + 5) = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
     \]
   - Calculate each part separately:
     \[
     170 \times 60 = 10200
     \]
     \[
     170 \times 5 = 850
     \]
   - Add the results:
     \[
     10200 + 850 = 11050

"To find the average speed of the car during the entire trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip:

1. For the first segment:
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \( 60 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles} \)

2. For the second segment:
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \( 30 \, \text{mph} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 30 \, \text{miles} \)

Next, we add the distances to find the total distance:
\[ 120 \, \text{miles} + 30 \, \text{miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} \]

Now, we calculate the total time taken:
\[ 2 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \]

Finally, we find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:
\[ \text{Average speed} = \frac{150 \, \text{miles}}{3 \, \text{hours}} = 50 \, \text{mph} \]

So, the car's average speed during the trip is \( 50 \, \text{mph} \)."
"Jenna starts with 8 sapphires, each worth $800. After trading 3 sapphires for 2 rubies, she has 5 sapphires left. The value of these 5 sapphires is:

"To find out how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we start by calculating the daily total for both of them combined. Since Marin eats 4 apples a day and Nancy also eats 4 apples a day, together they eat \(4 + 4 = 8\) apples a day.

Next, we multiply this daily total by the number of days, which is 30. Therefore, the total number of apples they eat in 30 days is \(8 \times 30 = 240\).

Thus, the final numerical answer is \(\boxed{240}\)."
"Bob needs to buy potting soil to fill 10 raised beds, each measuring 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall. First, we calculate the volume of one raised bed:

\[ \text{Volume of one bed} = 2 \times 8 \times 2 = 32 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of potting soil required is:

\[ \text{Total volume} = 10 \times 32 = 320 \text{ cubic feet} \]

Each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil. Therefore, the number of bags needed is:

\[ \text{Number of bags} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \]

Each bag costs $12, so the total cost is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 160 \times 12 = 1920 \]

Thus, the total cost for the potting soil is:

\[ \boxed{1920} \]"
"To determine the total number of cards of all mentioned colors, we proceed as follows:

1. **Red Cards**: There are 15 red cards.
2. **Green Cards**: The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards. Therefore, we calculate 60% of 15 and add it to 15 to find the number of green cards.
   \[
   \text{Number of green cards} = 15 + (0.60 \times 15) = 15 + 9 = 24
   \]
3. **Yellow Cards**: The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards.
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of cards of all mentioned colors:
\[
\text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of red cards} + \text{Number of green cards} + \text{Number of yellow cards} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78
\]

Thus, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is **78**."

"To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents, we start by converting the shark's length from feet to inches. Since the shark is 10 feet long and 1 foot equals 12 inches, the shark's length in inches is:

\[ 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches} \]

Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras, so the combined length of the remoras is:

\[ 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

To find what percentage of the shark's body length (120 inches) the combined length of the remoras (12 inches) represents, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Length of remoras}}{\text{Shark's body length}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\% \]

"To determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. 

Given:
- \( |A| = 9 \) (kids allergic to dairy)
- \( |B| = 6 \) (kids allergic to peanuts)
- \( |A \cap B| = 3 \) (kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts)

The number of kids allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both is calculated as:
\[ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 \]

Since there are 32 kids in total, the number of kids who are not allergic to anything is:

"To determine how many fewer songs Luri can add to his player compared to Gabriel, we start by calculating the number of songs each can add. Each player can store up to 100 songs.

Gabriel currently has 20 songs, so the number of songs he can add is:
\[ 100 - 20 = 80 \]

Luri currently has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, which means:
\[ 3 \times 20 = 60 \]
Thus, the number of songs Luri can add is:
\[ 100 - 60 = 40 \]

To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number Gabriel can add:
\[ 80 - 40 = 40 \]

"To solve the problem using a system of linear equations, let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as \( L \), \( D \), and \( B \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. \( L + D + B = 43 \)
2. \( L = D + 7 \)
3. \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)

First, we can express \( L \) and \( B \) in terms of \( D \) using the second and third equations:

From the third equation, we have:
\[ B = 2D \]

Substituting \( L = D + 7 \) and \( B = 2D \) into the first equation, we get:
\[ (D + 7) + D + 2D = 43 \]

Combining like terms, we have:
\[ 4D + 7 = 43 \]

Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 4D = 36 \]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[ D = 9 \]

Now, we can find \( L \) and \( B \):
\[ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 \]
\[ B = 2D = 2 \times 9 = 18 \]

Thus, the number of insects found by Lily is \( 16 \).

"To solve the problem systematically, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the cost of each pack of strawberry gum as \( S \), the cost of each pack of grape gum as \( G \), and the cost of the small pack of green apple gum as \( A \).

From the problem, we know:
1. Suzie bought four packs of gum in total.
2. She bought two packs of strawberry gum.
3. She bought one pack of grape gum for $2.
4. She bought a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $1.
5. The total cost of all the gum is $7.

We can express the total cost as:
\[ 2S + G + A = 7 \]

Given that \( G = 2 \) and \( A = 1 \), we substitute these values into the equation:
\[ 2S + 2 + 1 = 7 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 3 = 7 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 4 \]

Frederick has $24 to spend. A 2 x 4 piece of wood costs $4, and he can get 200 sticks from it. A 2 x 8 piece of wood costs $6, and he can get 400 sticks from it.

First, let's calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces he can buy:
\[
\text{Number of 2 x 4 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$4} = 6 \text{ pieces}
\]
\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 4 pieces} = 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks}
\]

Next, let's calculate how many 2 x 8 pieces he can buy:
\[
\text{Number of 2 x 8 pieces} = \frac{\$24}{\$6} = 4 \text{ pieces}
\]
\[
\text{Total sticks from 2 x 8 pieces} = 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks}
\]

Since the 2 x 8 pieces yield more sticks per piece, Frederick should buy the 2 x 8 pieces to maximize the number of sticks. Therefore, the maximum number of popsicle sticks he can make is:
\[
\boxed{1600}

First, we find the total number of bus trips Janet takes in a week:
- Janet takes 2 bus trips each day.
- She takes 5 days a week.
- Therefore, the total number of bus trips per week is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) trips.

Next, we calculate the total cost of these bus trips:
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- So, the total cost for 10 bus trips is \(10 \times 2.20 = 22.00\) dollars.

Now, we compare this total cost to the cost of the weekly bus pass:
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Finally, we find the savings by subtracting the cost of the bus pass from the total cost of the bus trips:
- Savings = Total cost of bus trips - Cost of bus pass
- Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass."

"To determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we start by understanding the given information and the relationship between the quantities bought by Sophia and Rose. Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought. Given that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 12 + 4 \]

Where \( S_o \) is the number of onions Sophia bought and \( S_p \) is the number of potatoes Sophia bought. First, we calculate the total number of onions and potatoes Rose bought:

\[ 12 + 4 = 16 \]

Now, we set up the equation based on the relationship:
\[ 4 \times (S_o + S_p) = 16 \]

To find \( S_o + S_p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
\[ S_o + S_p = \frac{16}{4} \]
\[ S_o + S_p = 4 \]

Thus, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml} \]

Thus, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is:

\[ \boxed{120} \text{ milliliters} \]"
"Julie initially had $500. She spent 20% of it on clothes, which amounts to:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100 \]

After spending $100 on clothes, the remaining amount is:

\[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Then, she spent 25% of the remaining $400 on CDs, which is:

\[ 25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100 \]

After spending $100 on CDs, the remaining amount is:

\[ 400 - 100 = 300 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:

\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given information: the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, and the house costs three times as much as the lot. Let's denote the cost of the lot as \( L \) and the cost of the house as \( H \).

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( H + L = 120,000 \)
2. \( H = 3L \)

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( L \):
\[ 3L + L = 120,000 \]
\[ 4L = 120,000 \]
\[ L = \frac{120,000}{4} \]
\[ L = 30,000 \]

Now that we have the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the second equation:
\[ H = 3L \]
\[ H = 3 \times 30,000 \]
\[ H = 90,000 \]

Therefore, the cost of the house is $90,000. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 90000 \]"
"To determine Tara's profit, we start by calculating the total cost of the canvas bags she bought. She purchased 8 packs, each containing 5 bags, at a cost of $4 per pack. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[ 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the 40 canvas bags at $8 each:

\[ 40 \times 8 = 320 \text{ dollars} \]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[ 320 - 32 = 288 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Tara's profit is:

\[ \boxed{288} \]"
"To find out how many punches Joe threw, we start by calculating the total duration of the fight. Given that a fight lasts 5 rounds and each round is 3 minutes long, the total duration is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) minutes.

Next, we know Joe throws 25 punches per minute. To find the total number of punches thrown over the 15-minute duration, we multiply the number of punches per minute by the total minutes of the fight: \(25 \times 15 = 375\).

Therefore, the total number of punches Joe threw is 375."
"To determine how many cookies Kelsie made, we start by understanding the relationships given in the problem. Suzanne made 36 cookies. Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Therefore, we calculate the number of cookies Josh made as follows:

\[
\text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
\]

Next, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This means Kelsie made twice the number of cookies Josh made. Thus, we calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made as:

\[
\text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

Therefore, the number of cookies Kelsie made is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]"
"Ali initially has a total of $160. He gives half of this amount to his sister, which is $80. This leaves him with $80. He then spends \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the remaining $80 on dinner. The amount spent on dinner is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Amount spent on dinner} = \frac{3}{5} \times 80 = 48
\]

Subtracting the amount spent on dinner from the remaining $80, we find the amount of money Ali has left:

\[
\text{Remaining money} = 80 - 48 = 32
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is \(\boxed{32}\)."
"To determine how many minutes Royce takes to shingle a house, we start by noting that Rob takes 2 hours, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes.

First, we calculate double the time Rob takes:
\[ 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we add the additional 40 minutes to this amount:
\[ 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 280 \]"
"To determine the total number of skeins of wool Martha will need, we'll calculate the requirements for each item and then sum them up.

1. **Hats**: Each grandchild needs 1 hat, and for 3 grandchildren, she needs 3 hats. Each hat requires 2 skeins of wool. Therefore, for 3 hats, she needs \(3 \times 2 = 6\) skeins of wool.
2. **Scarves**: Each grandchild needs 1 scarf, and for 3 grandchildren, she needs 3 scarves. Each scarf requires 4 skeins of wool. Therefore, for 3 scarves, she needs \(3 \times 4 = 12\) skeins of wool.
3. **Sweaters**: Each grandchild needs 1 sweater, and for 3 grandchildren, she needs 3 sweaters. Each sweater requires 12 skeins of wool. Therefore, for 3 sweaters, she needs \(3 \times 12 = 36\) skeins of wool.
4. **Mittens**: Each grandchild needs 1 pair of mittens, and for 3 grandchildren, she needs 3 pairs of mittens. Each pair of mittens requires 1 skein of wool. Therefore, for 3 pairs of mittens, she needs \(3 \times 1 = 3\) skeins of wool.

"To determine how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of problems Chris completes on Tuesday.
2. Determine the total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday.
3. Calculate the number of problems remaining after Tuesday.
4. Determine the number of problems Chris completes on Wednesday.
5. Calculate the number of problems remaining after Wednesday.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Chris completes 12 problems on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. Therefore, the number of problems completed on Tuesday is:
   \[
   3 \times 12 = 36
   \]

3. The total number of problems completed by the end of Tuesday is the sum of the problems completed on Monday and Tuesday:
   \[
   12 + 36 = 48
   \]

4. The number of problems remaining after Tuesday is the total number of problems minus the problems completed by the end of Tuesday:
   \[
   100 - 48 = 52
   \]

5. On Wednesday, Chris completes one-quarter of the remaining problems. Therefore, the number of problems completed on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13
   \]

6. The number of problems remaining after Wednesday is the number of problems remaining after Tuesday minus the problems completed on Wednesday:
   \[
   52 - 13 = 39
   \]

Thus, the number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is:
\[
\boxed{39}

"To determine the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour, we will calculate the individual rates and then sum them up.

1. **Tony** can pick 6 quarts per hour.
2. **Bobby** picks one less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick \(6 - 1 = 5\) quarts per hour.
3. **Kathy** can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick \(2 \times 5 = 10\) quarts per hour.
4. **Ricky** picks two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick \(10 - 2 = 8\) quarts per hour.

Now, we sum the quarts picked per hour by all four individuals:

\[
6 \text{ (Tony)} + 5 \text{ (Bobby)} + 10 \text{ (Kathy)} + 8 \text{ (Ricky)} = 29
\]

Therefore, the total number of quarts of strawberries that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour is \(\boxed{29}\)."

Next, we subtract the loaves sold in the afternoon: \(107 - 39 = 68\).

Finally, we add the loaves returned by the grocery store: \(68 + 6 = 74\).

Therefore, the number of loaves of bread they had left is 74."
"To determine the total number of rows Jackson will plant, we need to calculate the number of rows for each color of tulips separately and then sum them up.

For the red tulips:
- Jackson has 36 red tulips.
- He can plant 6 red tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows of red tulips is calculated as:
  \[
  \frac{36 \text{ red tulips}}{6 \text{ red tulips/row}} = 6 \text{ rows}
  \]

For the blue tulips:
- Jackson has 24 blue tulips.
- He can plant 8 blue tulips in a row.
- Therefore, the number of rows of blue tulips is calculated as:
  \[
  \frac{24 \text{ blue tulips}}{8 \text{ blue tulips/row}} = 3 \text{ rows}
  \]

Adding the rows of both colors together:
\[
6 \text{ rows of red tulips} + 3 \text{ rows of blue tulips} = 9 \text{ rows}
\]

Thus, the total number of rows Jackson will plant is:
\[
\boxed{9}

- New device consumption: 2 kilowatts per hour
- Total daily consumption after adding the new device:
\[ 12 \text{ kW/h} + 2 \text{ kW/h} = 14 \text{ kW/h} \]

First, calculate the daily cost after adding the new device:
\[ 14 \text{ kW/h} \times \$1.50/\text{kW/h} = \$21 \]

Next, calculate the weekly cost after adding the new device:
\[ \$21 \times 7 \text{ days} = \$147 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference between the weekly costs.
Difference in weekly cost:
\[ \$147 - \$126 = \$21 \]

Therefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is:

"To determine how many hours it would take for 5 people to paint a whole house, we start by understanding the painting rate of one person and then scale it up for 5 people.

1. **Determine the painting rate of one person:**
   - One person can paint half a house in 5 days.
   - Therefore, in one day, one person can paint \(\frac{1}{2} \div 5 = \frac{1}{10}\) of a house.

2. **Determine the combined painting rate of 5 people:**
   - If one person can paint \(\frac{1}{10}\) of a house in one day, then 5 people can paint \(5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2}\) of a house in one day.

3. **Determine the time required for 5 people to paint a whole house:**
   - Since 5 people can paint \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a house in one day, they will need \(2\) days to paint a whole house.

4. **Convert the time from days to hours:**
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Therefore, 2 days is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) hours.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}

"To solve the problem systematically, we start by defining the variables and using the given relationships:

1. Ophelia has 20 sofas, so \( S_O = 20 \).
2. Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, which translates to \( S_O = C_O - 2 \). Substituting \( S_O = 20 \) into this equation gives us \( 20 = C_O - 2 \), solving for \( C_O \) yields \( C_O = 22 \).
3. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so \( C_J = 3C_O \). Substituting \( C_O = 22 \) into this equation gives us \( C_J = 3 \times 22 = 66 \).
4. Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, which translates to \( S_J = C_J - 2 \). Substituting \( C_J = 66 \) into this equation gives us \( S_J = 66 - 2 = 64 \).

Now, we calculate the total number of sofas and chairs:
- Total sofas: \( S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84 \)
- Total chairs: \( C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88 \)
- Total number of sofas and chairs: \( 84 + 88 = 172 \)

Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that Ophelia and Jenna have together is \(\boxed{172}\)."
"To determine how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had not bought the headphone set, we can set up a simple linear equation.

1. **Determine the cost of the headphone set:**
   - Tom paid a total of $48 for the CD and the headphone set.
   - The CD cost $4.
   - Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is:
     \[
     48 - 4 = 44 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many CDs Tom could buy with the money spent on the headphone set:**
   - Each CD costs $4.
   - With $44, the number of CDs Tom could buy is:
     \[
     \frac{44}{4} = 11 \text{ CDs}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more CDs Tom could have bought without the headphone set:**
   - Without the headphone set, Tom would have $48.
   - The number of CDs he could buy with $48 is:
     \[
     \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ CDs}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of additional CDs he could have bought is:
     \[
     12 - 11 = 1 \text{ CD}
     \]

Thus, if Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have been able to buy \(\boxed{1}\) more CD."
"To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for the different hours he worked out each week.

1. For 6 weeks, he worked out for 4 hours each week:
   \[
   6 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. For 2 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week:
   \[

"Let's solve the problem step by step, ensuring each transition is clearly understood.

Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
- 8 passengers get off the bus.
- The number of passengers who get on the bus is 5 times the number who got off, which is \(5 \times 8 = 40\).

So, the number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
\[ 48 - 8 + 40 = 80 \]

**Second Stop:**
- 21 passengers get off the bus.
- The number of passengers who get on the bus is 3 times fewer than those who got off, which means they get on \( \frac{21}{3} = 7 \) passengers.

So, the number of people on the bus after the second stop is:
\[ 80 - 21 + 7 = 66 \]

Therefore, the final number of passengers on the bus after the second stop is \(\boxed{66}\)."
"To solve the problem using systems of linear equations, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information provided.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be Jame's current age.
   - Let \( C \) be his cousin's current age.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know that in 5 years, Jame will be 27 years old. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     J + 5 = 27
     \]
     Solving for \( J \):
     \[
     J = 27 - 5 = 22
     \]
   - In 8 years, Jame will be \( 22 + 8 = 30 \) years old. According to the problem, in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. So, we can write the equation:
     \[
     C + 8 = 2 \times 30 - 5
     \]
     Simplifying the right side:
     \[
     C + 8 = 60 - 5 = 55
     \]
     Solving for \( C \):
     \[
     C = 55 - 8 = 47
     \]

3. **Calculate the Age Difference:**
   - The age difference between Jame and his cousin is:
     \[
     C - J = 47 - 22 = 25
     \]

Thus, the number of years separating the age of Jame and his cousin is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and using the given information to set up equations. Let's denote the cost of the computer as \( C \), the cost of one monitor as \( M \), and the cost of the printer as \( P \).

From the problem, we know:
1. The total cost of the computer, 2 monitors, and the printer is $2,400.
2. Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, so \( P = C - 400 \).
3. The cost of the computer is $1,100, so \( C = 1100 \).

First, substitute the value of \( C \) into the equation for \( P \):
\[ P = 1100 - 400 = 700 \]

Now, we know the total cost equation:
\[ C + 2M + P = 2400 \]
Substitute the known values of \( C \) and \( P \):
\[ 1100 + 2M + 700 = 2400 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 1800 + 2M = 2400 \]
Subtract 1800 from both sides:
\[ 2M = 600 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ M = 300 \]

Therefore, the cost of one monitor is \( 300 \) dollars.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{300} \]"
"To determine the number of seashells each girl brought, we can break down the problem into a few clear steps:

1. **Identify the number of boys and girls:**
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - Since the number of boys and girls is equal, we have:
     \[
     \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ boys and } 10 \text{ girls}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys:**
   - Each boy brought 60 seashells.
   - Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
     \[
     10 \times 60 = 600
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of seashells brought by the girls:**
   - Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of seashells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - The number of seashells brought by the boys is 60.
   - Four times the number of seashells brought by the boys is:
     \[
     4 \times 60 = 240
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of seashells brought by each girl is:
     \[
     60 + 240 = 300
     \]

Thus, the number of seashells brought by each girl is \(\boxed{300}\)."

3. The third book is 5 mm less than the second book, which makes it \(50 - 5 = 45\) mm thick.
4. The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, which makes it \(2 \times 31 = 62\) mm thick.

Now, we sum these thicknesses:
\[
31 + 50 + 45 + 62
\]

Adding these step by step:
\[
31 + 50 = 81
\]
\[
81 + 45 = 126

\[ 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \]

Emma's goal is to make 72 vlogs per month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal:

\[ 72 - 54 = 18 \]

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to complete her goal. The final numerical answer is 18."
"To determine how much you ended up paying, we need to calculate the total amount including the tip.

1. **Calculate the tip:**
   - The dinner bill is $50.
   - You want to add an additional 20% tip.
   - To find 20% of $50, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Tip} = \text{Bill} \times \frac{20}{100} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount:**
   - The total amount is the sum of the bill and the tip:
     \[
     \text{Total Amount} = \text{Bill} + \text{Tip} = 50 + 10 = 60
     \]

Therefore, you ended up paying $60.

The correct answer is **$60**."

"To determine how much Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April, we start by setting up the equation based on the given conditions. Elvis's total monthly saving target is $1125. He plans to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half.

Let \( x \) be the daily savings in the first half of April. Consequently, the daily savings in the second half of April will be \( 2x \).

Since April has 30 days, the first half consists of 15 days and the second half also consists of 15 days. Therefore, the total savings in the first half of April is:
\[ 15x \]

And the total savings in the second half of April is:
\[ 15 \times 2x = 30x \]

The total monthly savings is the sum of the savings from both halves:
\[ 15x + 30x = 45x \]

Given that the total monthly saving target is $1125, we set up the equation:
\[ 45x = 1125 \]

To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1125}{45} \]
\[ x = 25 \]

Thus, Elvis needs to save $25 each day in the first half of April. Consequently, in the second half of April, he needs to save:
\[ 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 for each day in the second half of the month.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how much change Verna received, we start by calculating the total cost of the fruits she bought. 

First, the cost of the apples:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
- Total cost for apples = 3 * $1.50 = $4.50

Next, the cost of the oranges:
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
- Total cost for oranges = 5 * $0.80 = $4.00

Then, the cost of the peaches:
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
- Total cost for peaches = 6 * $0.75 = $4.50

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of the fruits:
- Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to the seller. To find the change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave:
- Change received = $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the amount of change Verna received is $7.00."
"To determine how much more Jairus earns compared to Jenny, we start by calculating the earnings for each of them based on the number of tasks they completed.

\[
\text{Jairus's earnings} = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate Jenny's earnings:
\[
\text{Jenny's earnings} = 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:
\[
\text{Difference in earnings} = 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Jairus earns \(\boxed{6}\) dollars more than Jenny."
"To solve the problem, we start with the equation representing the total amount of money divided between Jeff and Brad:

\[ B + 4B = 100 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5B = 100 \]

To find the value of \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ B = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \]

Since Brad gets 20 dollars, Jeff, who gets 4 times as much, will get:

\[ 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars. The final answer is:

\[ 80 \]"
"To determine the total miles Jeff walks in a week, we start by calculating the daily distance he walks. Since Jeff walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles back home each day, the total distance walked per day is \(3 + 3 = 6\) miles.

"To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we start by calculating his weekly earnings. John earns $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day, so his daily earnings are:

\[ 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours/day} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \]

Since he works 4 days a week, his weekly earnings are:

\[ 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week} \]

To find out how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

\[ \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80."
"To find the total cost for lunch today at Subway, we start by calculating the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, which is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub. Given that the foot-long fish sub costs $40, the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs:

\[ 3 \times 40 = 120 \]

\[ \text{Volume of Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Next, Peter's locker is one-fourth the size of Zack's locker. Therefore, we calculate Peter's locker volume as:

\[ \text{Volume of Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Thus, the volume of Peter's locker is:

\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Daily Recommended Coffee Intake**: Let's denote the daily recommended cups of coffee as \( R \).

2. **Octavia's Coffee Intake**: Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. Therefore, she drinks \( \frac{R}{2} \) cups of coffee.

3. **Juan's Coffee Intake**: Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, he drinks \( 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R \) cups of coffee.

4. **Doctor's Recommendation**: Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

5. **Reduction in Coffee Intake**: To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we subtract the daily recommendation from his current intake:
   \[
   5R - 4
   \]

Since the problem does not specify the value of \( R \), we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume \( R = 8 \) (a common daily recommended amount of coffee), then:
\[
5R - 4 = 5 \times 8 - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36
\]

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 36 cups.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}

"To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we start by calculating the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately.

First, we calculate the number of hamsters:
- There are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each.
- Therefore, the total number of hamsters is \(3 \times 10 = 30\).

Next, we calculate the number of guinea pigs:
- There are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.
- Therefore, the total number of guinea pigs is \(3 \times 5 = 15\).

Now, we add the number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents:
- Total number of rodents = Number of hamsters + Number of guinea pigs
- Total number of rodents = \(30 + 15 = 45\).

The total number of rodents in the pet shop is 45."
"To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we start by calculating the individual weights:
- Mark weighs 150 pounds.
- Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, which is \(150 - 20 = 130\) pounds.
- Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, which is \(2 \times 130 = 260\) pounds.

Next, we sum their weights:
\[ 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds} \]

To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 3:
\[ \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds} \]

Thus, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds."
"To determine the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we start with the initial angle of the sun from the ground, which is 32 degrees. The sun moves upward at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. Over 10 hours, the sun will move \(5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}\) upward from the tip of the pyramid.

Since the tip of the pyramid is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground, the total angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be the sum of these two angles:
\[
32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
\]

Thus, the final angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours is 82 degrees.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{82}\)."
"To find out how much James spends on candles, we start by determining the total number of candles needed. Since one son is 12 years old and the other is 4 years younger, the second son is 8 years old. Therefore, James needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of 5 candles are required. Since each pack contains 5 candles, the number of packs needed is 20 / 5 = 4 packs.

Finally, since each pack costs $3, the total amount James spends is 4 packs * $3/pack = $12.

Therefore, the amount James spends on candles is $12."
"To determine the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total reading time in the first week
Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 days in the first week.
\[
15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the reading time in the first week to pages
We know that Judy can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she reads in 1 minute, we divide 2 pages by 1.5 minutes:
\[
\frac{2 \text{ pages}}{1.5 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute}
\]

Now, we convert the 105 minutes of reading time in the first week to pages:
\[
105 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{4}{3} \text{ pages/minute} = 140 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 3: Add the reading time in the second week
In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.

### Step 4: Calculate the total reading time in two weeks
\[
140 \text{ pages (first week)} + 100 \text{ pages (second week)} = 240 \text{ pages}
\]

Thus, the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is:
\[
\boxed{240}

"To find out how many sandwiches are left, we start with the total number of sandwiches, which is 12.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, so we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, so we calculate:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Adding the sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor gives:
\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Subtracting the total sandwiches eaten from the original number of sandwiches leaves:
\[ 12 - 7 = 5 \text{ sandwiches} \]

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is 5."
"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equation based on the information given.

Let \( x \) be the current age of Shiloh's nephew.

Shiloh's current age is 44 years.

In 7 years, Shiloh's age will be:
\[ 44 + 7 = 51 \]

In 7 years, his nephew's age will be:
\[ x + 7 \]

According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ 51 = 3(x + 7) \]
\[ 51 = 3x + 21 \]
Subtract 21 from both sides:
\[ 51 - 21 = 3x \]
\[ 30 = 3x \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the current age of Shiloh's nephew is:
\[ \boxed{10} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we will break down the problem into clear steps and calculate the total amount systematically.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - The tooth fairy left $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave $1.00.
   - Total for these three teeth: \(3 \times 1.00 = 3.00\) dollars.

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For each of the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave half the amount of money per tooth as the previous three teeth.
   - Amount per tooth for the last two teeth: \(\frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50\) dollars.
   - Total for the last two teeth: \(2 \times 0.50 = 1.00\) dollars.

Now, we sum up all the amounts given by the tooth fairy:

\[
5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

\[
\boxed{9.00}

"To solve the problem using systems of linear equations, let's define the variables first:

- Let \( R \) represent the number of goals Richie scored.
- Let \( M \) represent the number of goals Mark scored.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark: \( R = M + 20 \).
2. Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna: \( R = A + 45 \).
3. Richie scored 80 goals: \( R = 80 \).

First, we substitute the value of \( R \) into the first equation to find \( M \):

\[
80 = M + 20 \implies M = 80 - 20 = 60
\]

Next, we substitute the value of \( R \) into the second equation to find \( A \):

\[
80 = A + 45 \implies A = 80 - 45 = 35
\]

Now, we can find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers by summing their individual goals:

\[
\text{Total goals} = R + M + A = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
\]

Therefore, the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers is \(\boxed{175}\)."

Therefore, the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet is \(\boxed{11232}\) dollars."
"To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first sum the total number of birds seen each day:

- Day 1 and Day 2: 50 birds
- Day 3: 0 birds
- Day 4 and Day 5: 120 birds
- Day 6: 20 birds
- Day 7: 90 birds

Adding these together gives:
\[ 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \text{ birds} \]

Next, we determine the number of days in the week, which is 7 days.

To find the average number of birds seen per day, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{280 \text{ birds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 40 \text{ birds/day} \]

Therefore, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[
40

Adding the cards together, we get \(5 + 2 = 7\).

Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 7."
"To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven when the recipe calls for 520 degrees, we need to account for the 4% error in the oven's temperature readings.

Given that the oven is off by 4% when set to 450 degrees and the actual temperature is 468 degrees, we can use this percentage error to find the correct setting for 520 degrees.

Let \( x \) be the temperature setting that Maggie should use. The actual temperature will be:
\[ x - 0.04x = 0.96x \]

We know that the actual temperature should be 520 degrees:
\[ 0.96x = 520 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{520}{0.96} \]
\[ x = 541.67 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set the oven to approximately 541.67 degrees to achieve the desired 520 degrees.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 541.67 \]"
"To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we first convert the durations into minutes and then add them together.

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 + 30 = 90 minutes

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. Converting this to minutes:
- 2 hours = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes
- 2 hours and 5 minutes = 120 + 5 = 125 minutes

Adding the durations of the two movies:
- First movie: 90 minutes
- Second movie: 125 minutes
- Total duration: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes

Therefore, the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies is 215 minutes."
"To find the value of Juan's house, we start by calculating 30% of Herb's house, which is worth $76,000. 

\[ 30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800 \]

Subtracting this from Herb's house gives us the value of Juan's house:

\[ 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200 \]

Now, to find the combined value of both houses, we add the value of Herb's house to the value of Juan's house:

\[ 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200 \]

Therefore, the value of the two houses combined is \(\boxed{129200}\)."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the information provided.

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so she bought \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dishes.

At the event, her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy's friend brought. Therefore, her friend brought \(40 + 20 = 60\) dishes.

Next, we calculate the total number of cups and dishes brought by both Judy and her friend.

Total cups brought:
\[ 12 \text{ (Judy's cups)} + 40 \text{ (friend's cups)} = 52 \text{ cups} \]

Total dishes brought:
\[ 24 \text{ (Judy's dishes)} + 60 \text{ (friend's dishes)} = 84 \text{ dishes} \]

The total number of utensils (cups and dishes) brought by both is:
\[ 52 \text{ cups} + 84 \text{ dishes} = 136 \text{ utensils} \]

Thus, the total number of utensils brought by the two is \(\boxed{136}\)."
"To determine the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes, we start by calculating the discounted price of one box. The original price of one box is $100.00, and there is a 10% discount applied.

First, calculate the discount amount:
\[ 100.00 \times 0.10 = 10.00 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price of one box:
\[ 100.00 - 10.00 = 90.00 \]

Next, calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:
\[ 90.00 \times 2 = 180.00 \]

Each box contains 90 single use contacts, so 2 boxes contain:
\[ 90 \times 2 = 180 \text{ contacts} \]

Since Pete uses one pair of contacts per day, 180 contacts will last for:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ contacts}}{2 \text{ contacts per pair}} = 90 \text{ pairs} \]

Finally, calculate the cost per pair of contacts:
\[ \frac{180.00}{90} = 2.00 \]

Therefore, the cost per pair of contacts is:
\[ \boxed{2.00} \]"
"To determine how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we start by calculating the total hours each worked.

Jill worked:
- 2 hours on Saturday
- 1 hour on Sunday

Total hours Jill worked = 2 + 1 = 3 hours

John worked:
- Twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 2 * 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.
- Three times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 * 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.

Total hours John worked = 4 + 3 = 7 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for both Jill and John.

Earnings for Jill = 3 hours * $10/hour = $30

Earnings for John = 7 hours * $10/hour = $70

Finally, we find the difference in earnings:

Difference in earnings = Earnings of John - Earnings of Jill = $70 - $30 = $40

Therefore, John earned $40 more than Jill."
"To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories burned:**
   - During aerobics: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}\)
   - During running: \(1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}\)
   - Total calories burned: \(1000 \text{ calories} + 600 \text{ calories} = 1600 \text{ calories}\)

2. **Determine the water consumption based on calories burned:**
   - Hannah needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.
   - Water needed for 1600 calories: \(\frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml}\)

Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 800 ml.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of blue jelly beans as \( B \). According to the problem, the number of red jelly beans \( R \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:
\[ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B \]

Similarly, the number of green jelly beans \( G \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which can be expressed as:
\[ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B \]

The total number of jelly beans is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ R + B + G = 4500 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( R \) and \( G \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500 \]

Combining the terms on the left-hand side:
\[ 0.99B + B + 1.01B = 3B \]

So, we have:
\[ 3B = 4500 \]

Solving for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500 \]

Now, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:
\[ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 \]
\[ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 \]

To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[ G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30 \]

Therefore, the number of green jelly beans that are more than the number of red jelly beans is:
\[ \boxed{30} \]"

1. Initial speed: 47 WPM
2. Speed after first increase: 52 WPM
3. Speed after second increase: 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Next, we sum these three speeds:

\[
47 + 52 + 57 = 156
\]

Then, we calculate the average by dividing the sum by 3:

\[
\frac{156}{3} = 52
\]

Therefore, the average of the three measurements is 52 WPM.

\[
\boxed{52}

"To determine the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts, we need to calculate the weight changes for each option over the 5-week period and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the weight change for eating Cheerios:
- Martin loses 1.25 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight loss is:
  \[
  1.25 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 6.25 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Next, let's calculate the weight change for eating donuts:
- Martin gains 1.75 pounds per week.
- Over 5 weeks, the total weight gain is:
  \[
  1.75 \text{ pounds/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 8.75 \text{ pounds}
  \]

Now, we find the difference in weight between the two options:
\[
8.75 \text{ pounds} - 6.25 \text{ pounds} = 2.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between eating Cheerios and eating donuts is:

"To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we first calculate the total cost for each platform.

For Amazon:
- The cost of the boots is $16.
- The shipping cost is $4.
- Therefore, the total cost on Amazon is:
  \[
  16 + 4 = 20
  \]

For eBay:
- The cost of the boots is $13.
- The shipping cost is twice that of Amazon, which is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost on eBay is:
  \[
  13 + 8 = 21

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay:
\[
21 - 20 = 1
\]

Thus, the boots are \(\boxed{1}\) dollar more expensive on eBay."
"To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we start with the initial height of the beanstalk and observe its growth pattern.

The initial height of the beanstalk is 4 feet, and it doubles its height every day. Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground.

Let's calculate the height of the beanstalk day by day:

- Day 0 (initial height): \(4\) feet
- Day 1: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet
- Day 2: \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet
- Day 3: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet

On Day 3, the height of the beanstalk is 32 feet, which is taller than the 20 feet height of Mark's window.

Therefore, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's window on Day 3.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many grams of protein John gets per week from eating 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can follow these steps using a ratio-based approach:

1. **Determine the protein content per gram of mushrooms:**
   - 100 grams of mushrooms contain 3 grams of protein.
   - Therefore, the protein content per gram of mushrooms is:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the protein content in 200 grams of mushrooms:**
   - If 1 gram of mushrooms contains 0.03 grams of protein, then 200 grams of mushrooms will contain:
     \[
     200 \text{ grams of mushrooms} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms} = 6 \text{ grams of protein}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total protein intake per week:**
   - John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total protein intake per week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ grams of protein per day} \times 7 \text{ days per week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week}

"Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( J \).

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ J = 2 \times (J - 5) \]

First, we solve for \( J \):
\[ J = 2J - 10 \]
\[ J - 2J = -10 \]
\[ -J = -10 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

Therefore, the number of hours George needs to work is:
\[ \boxed{260} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the angles in terms of the smallest angle, \( x \). According to the problem, one angle is \( 2x \) and another angle is \( 3x \). The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ x + 2x + 3x = 180 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 6x = 180 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

\[ x = \frac{180}{6} = 30 \]

Now that we know the smallest angle \( x \) is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is:

\[ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ degrees} \]

The angle that is three times the smallest angle is:

\[ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ degrees} \]

The largest angle in the triangle is the one that is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is:

\[ \boxed{90} \]"

"To determine how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we start by calculating the plane's speed. Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, the speed of the plane is:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. Using the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed, we get:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}

"To solve the problem, we first determine Ruiz's hourly chocolate production rate. Given that Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours, we calculate the hourly rate as follows:

\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Next, we find Marissa's hourly chocolate production rate. The problem states that Marissa makes \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. Since Ruiz makes 120 pounds in two hours, we calculate Marissa's hourly rate as:

\[
\text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Ruiz makes in 12 hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's total in 12 hours} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

Similarly, we calculate the total amount of chocolates Marissa makes in 12 hours:

\[
\text{Marissa's total in 12 hours} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total amounts of chocolates made by Ruiz and Marissa to find the combined total:

\[
\text{Total chocolates} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[
\boxed{1260}

"To determine how much money Howard has left after his spending at the arcade, we'll calculate his total spending and subtract it from his initial amount.

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   Howard spends $8 on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's spending} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he did on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday's spending} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Spending:**
   To find the total amount spent over the three days, we sum the amounts spent each day.
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Money:**
   Howard originally had $100. To find out how much he has left after his spending, we subtract the total spending from his initial amount.
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars}

"To determine how many years Jeremy's tires need to be replaced, we start by calculating the total number of rotations the tires undergo in a month. Given that the tires rotate 725 times for every 2 miles driven, and Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we first find the rotations per mile:

\[ \text{Rotations per mile} = \frac{725 \text{ rotations}}{2 \text{ miles}} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of rotations for 400 miles:

\[ \text{Total rotations per month} = 400 \text{ miles} \times 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile} = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month} \]

Now, we need to find out how many months it will take for the tires to reach 10,440,000 rotations. We do this by dividing the total number of rotations the tires can undergo by the number of rotations per month:

\[ \text{Total months} = \frac{10,440,000 \text{ rotations}}{145,000 \text{ rotations per month}} = 72 \text{ months} \]

Since there are 12 months in a year, we convert 72 months into years:

\[ \text{Total years} = \frac{72 \text{ months}}{12 \text{ months per year}} = 6 \text{ years} \]

Therefore, the tires need to be replaced after 6 years. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6 \]"
"To find the cost of each pump in cents, we can break down the problem into a few steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per wash:**
   - The total cost of the shampoo bottle is $24.00.
   - The total number of washes per bottle is 120 washes.
   - Therefore, the cost per wash is:
     \[
     \frac{24.00 \text{ dollars}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 0.20 \text{ dollars per wash}
     \]

2. **Convert the cost per wash to cents:**
   - Since 1 dollar = 100 cents, the cost per wash in cents is:
     \[
     0.20 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents per dollar} = 20 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost per pump:**
   - Each pump gives 60 washes.
   - Since each wash costs 20 cents, the cost per pump is:
     \[
     60 \text{ washes per pump} \times 20 \text{ cents per wash} = 1200 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, the cost of each pump is \(\boxed{1200}\) cents."
"Joe has $50 to buy an outfit for his new field trip. There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store. The shirt he picks out has a price of $25, and the shorts he picks out cost $35. Assuming that sales tax is included, the total cost of the outfit after the discount is calculated as follows:

- The discounted price of the shirt is $25 - (30% of $25) = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50.
- The discounted price of the shorts is $35 - (30% of $35) = $35 - $10.50 = $24.50.
- The total cost of the outfit is $17.50 + $24.50 = $42.00.
- After purchasing the outfit, the amount of money Joe will have left is $50 - $42.00 = $8.00.

Therefore, the final amount of money Joe will have left is **$8.00**."
"To determine the amount of butter Juan needs, we start by noting that it takes \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week. 

First, calculate the total number of dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week:
\[
\text{Dozens per day} = 4
\]
\[
\text{Days in a week} = 7
\]
\[
\text{Total dozens per week} = 4 \text{ dozens/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozens}
\]

Next, calculate the total amount of butter needed for 28 dozens of croissants:
\[
\text{Butter per dozen} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound}
\]
\[
\text{Total butter needed} = 28 \text{ dozens} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, Juan will need \(\boxed{7}\) pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week."
"To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we first calculate the cost for each street individually.

For Monica's street:
- Length: 150 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \times 194 = 29100 \, \text{dollars}
\]

For Lewis' street:
- Length: 490 meters
- Cost per meter: $194

\]

Therefore, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street is **65760 dollars**."
"To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding into two parts: the initial 5 months and the extended 50 months.

1. **Initial Funding:**
   - John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months.

2. **Extended Funding:**
   - The research takes 10 times the initial 5 months, which means it takes 50 months in total.
   - The first 5 months of the extended period are already covered by the initial funding.
   - Therefore, the extended period is 50 - 5 = 45 months.

3. **Funding for Extended Period:**
   - Each month after the first 5 months costs 50% more than the initial $20,000 per month.
   - The cost per month for the extended period is $20,000 \times 1.5 = $30,000.
   - The total funding for the extended 45 months is 45 \times $30,000 = $1,350,000.

4. **Total Funding:**
   - Adding the initial funding and the extended funding gives us the total cost.
   - Total cost = Initial funding + Extended funding
   - Total cost = $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

Thus, the total cost of John's research is \(\boxed{1450000}\)."

"To find the total number of cars towed by the tow truck over the week, we'll break down the problem into two parts: the first three days and the remaining four days.

First, for the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day. So, the total for these days is:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} \]

Next, for the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars each day than it did on the first three days. Since it pulled 10 cars each day for the first three days, it pulled:
\[ 10 \text{ cars/day} - 4 \text{ cars/day} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \]
for each of the remaining four days. Therefore, the total for these days is:
\[ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} \]

Adding the totals from both parts gives us the overall total number of cars towed that week:
\[ 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars} \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed that week is:
\[ \boxed{54} \]"

"To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.

First, let's define the variables:
- \( v_B = 55 \) miles per hour (speed of Bob)
- \( v_T = 70 \) miles per hour (speed of Tom)
- \( d = 75 \) miles (distance between Bob and Tom)

The relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap is the difference in their speeds:
\[ v_{\text{relative}} = v_T - v_B = 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ miles per hour} \]

The time \( t \) it takes for Tom to close the 75-mile gap can be calculated using the formula:
\[ t = \frac{d}{v_{\text{relative}}} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ t = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 5 \]"

Thus, the number of fish Tommy caught is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to ensure that the cost per class does not exceed $10.

Given:
- Total cost for 10 classes: $60
- Maximum allowable cost per class: $10

First, calculate the maximum number of classes \( n \) such that the cost per class is at most $10:
\[ \frac{60}{n} \leq 10 \]

Solving for \( n \):
\[ 60 \leq 10n \]
\[ n \geq 6 \]

This means Manny can miss up to 6 classes and still have the cost per class be at most $10. Therefore, the maximum number of classes he can miss is:
\[ 10 - 6 = 4 \]

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again.

The correct answer is:

"To determine how many miles Lynn ran, we start by noting that Paisley ran 4 miles. Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles} \]

We are also informed that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Reggie's distance} = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

Substituting the distance Reggie ran:

\[ 20 = \text{Lynn's distance} + 3 \]

To find Lynn's distance, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ \text{Lynn's distance} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Lynn ran 17 miles. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{17} \]"
"To determine how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we start by setting up the equations based on the given information.

Given:
- Four apples cost $5.20.
- Three oranges cost $3.30.

First, we find the cost of one apple:
\[
\text{Cost of one apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30
\]

Next, we find the cost of one orange:
\[
\text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50
\]

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00
\]

Therefore, Clyde will pay \(\boxed{12.00}\)."
"To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first calculate the volume of the hole. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} \]

First, calculate the product of the length and the width:

\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, multiply the result by the depth:

\[ 24 \times 3 = 72 \]

So, the volume of the hole is 72 cubic feet.

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for Bob to dig this volume. It is given that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth. Therefore, the total time \( T \) required to dig the hole is:

\[ T = \text{volume} \times \text{time per cubic foot} \]

Substituting the volume and the time per cubic foot:

\[ T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot} \]

\[ T = 216 \, \text{seconds} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

\[ \boxed{216} \]"

"To determine the total cost of James's wardrobe, we'll break down the expenses step by step:

1. **Cost of Suits:**
   James buys 10 suits, each costing $750.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Dress Pants:**
   Each pair of dress pants costs 1/5 of the cost of a suit.
   \[
   \text{Cost of each pair of dress pants} = \frac{750}{5} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   James buys 10 pairs of dress pants.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Dress Shirts:**
   James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits.
   \[
   \text{Total number of dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30
   \]
   Each dress shirt costs $60.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, we sum up the total cost of all the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of suits} + \text{Cost of dress pants} + \text{Cost of dress shirts}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost of everything is **$10800**."

"To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday and Wednesday, we proceed as follows:

First, we calculate the total cost Clara paid for 20 pomegranates on Tuesday:
\[ 20 \times 20 = 400 \]
After applying the $2 voucher discount:
\[ 400 - 2 = 398 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost Sheila paid for 20 pomegranates on Wednesday. The price per pomegranate was $30, but she received a 10% discount on the total cost:
\[ 20 \times 30 = 600 \]
Applying the 10% discount:
\[ 600 \times 0.10 = 60 \]
\[ 600 - 60 = 540 \]

Finally, we find the difference between the final prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[ 540 - 398 = 142 \]

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is:
\[ \boxed{142} \]"
"Ariadne's sales from red hats in the first month were $400, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the total amount she earned from selling green hats in the first month is $800. The total amount she made in the first month is the sum of her sales from red and green hats:

\[ 400 + 800 = 1200 \]

In the second month, her sales were \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total sales of the first month. Therefore, the total amount she earned in the second month is:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900 \]

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the total sales of the first month and the total sales of the second month:

\[ 1200 + 900 = 2100 \]

Thus, the total amount Ariadne made in two months is **$2100**."
"To determine how much James paid for the horse-drawn carriage, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time hired:**
   James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables for the cooking times:
- Let \( R \) be the time it took to cook rice.
- Let \( B \) be the time it took to cook beans.
- Let \( P \) be the time it took to cook pork.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( R = 30 \) minutes.
2. It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, so \( P = R + 20 \).
3. The time to cook beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, so \( B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) \).

First, we calculate the cooking time for pork:
\[ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:
\[ P + R = 50 + 30 = 80 \text{ minutes} \]

Then, we calculate the cooking time for beans:
\[ B = \frac{1}{2} (P + R) = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we find the total cooking time for all the food:
\[ R + B + P = 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time it took to cook all the food is \(\boxed{120}\) minutes."
"To determine how much more it costs for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts compared to a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture separately and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/2 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 5 + 5 = 10 \) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts:
- The cost of 1/5 pound almonds is \( \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \) dollars.
- The cost of 1/3 pound walnuts is \( \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this mixture is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \) dollars.

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations based on the information provided:

1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 4S + 2G = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ 2S + G = 35 \]

Now, we have the system:
1. \( S + G = 20 \)
2. \( 2S + G = 35 \)

To eliminate \( G \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ 2S + G - S - G = 15 \]
\[ S = 15 \]

Thus, the number of sheep \( S \) is 15. To verify, we substitute \( S = 15 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 15 + G = 20 \]
\[ G = 5 \]

Now, we check the number of legs:
\[ 4S + 2G = 4(15) + 2(5) = 60 + 10 = 70 \]

The calculations confirm that the solution is correct. Therefore, the number of sheep on Lee's farm is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total cost of Roger's coffee and donut, we start by calculating the cost of the more expensive coffee brand. The normal brand costs $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand costs 20% more. Therefore, the cost of the more expensive coffee is:

\[ \text{Cost of more expensive coffee} = \$5 + (0.20 \times \$5) = \$5 + \$1 = \$6 \text{ per pound} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week. Since he uses 1 pound of coffee per day, the total coffee needed is:

\[ \text{Total coffee needed} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the coffee:

\[ \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times \$6/\text{pound} = \$42 \]

Roger also buys a donut for $2. Therefore, the total cost of everything is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of coffee} + \text{Cost of donut} = \$42 + \$2 = \$44 \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{44} \]"

\[ 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[ 3.5 + 7.5 = 11 \]

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
\[ 15 - 11 = 4 \]

Therefore, the amount of change Adam received is:
\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the number of good days left in the month, we start by noting the total number of good days Christina had over the 30 days, which is 12. We then account for the distribution of these good days:

- The first 8 days had 8 good days.
- The second 8 days had 0 good days.
- The third 8 days had 0 good days.

This accounts for \(8 + 0 + 0 = 8\) good days. We are also given the next three days:
- Day 29: 1 good day.
- Day 30: 1 good day.
- Day 31: 1 good day.

Adding these up, we get \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\) good days for the last three days.

Now, subtracting the good days accounted for from the total good days:
\[ 12 - (8 + 3) = 12 - 11 = 1 \]

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is:
\[
\boxed{1}

"To determine how many books Sally has, we start with the equation based on the information given: Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, and Janey has 21 books. This can be expressed as:

\[ 2S + 3 = 21 \]

To solve for \( S \), we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2S + 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ \frac{2S}{2} = \frac{18}{2} \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Therefore, Sally has 9 books. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how much the total weight exceeds the elevator's maximum load, we start by calculating the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults.

- Jack's weight is 80 kg.
- Each of the 8 other adults weighs 80 kg, so the total weight of the 8 adults is \( 8 \times 80 \) kg.

First, calculate the total weight of the 8 adults:

\[
8 \times 80 = 640 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, add Jack's weight to the total weight of the adults:

\[
80 \text{ kg} + 640 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg}
\]

The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg. To find out by how much they will exceed the maximum load, subtract the maximum load from the total weight:

\[
720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
\]

Therefore, the total weight exceeds the maximum load by 20 kg. The final numerical answer is:

"Given the relationships provided in the problem, we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for the number of cookies each person has. Let's denote the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has as \( C \), Max has as \( M \), Katarina has as \( K \), and Summer has as \( S \).

From the problem, we have:
1. \( K = M - 5 \)
2. \( M = C + 12 \)
3. \( S = M + 23 \)
4. \( K = 68 \)

First, we substitute \( K = 68 \) into the first equation to find \( M \):
\[ 68 = M - 5 \]
\[ M = 68 + 5 \]
\[ M = 73 \]

Next, we use \( M = 73 \) to find \( C \) from the second equation:
\[ 73 = C + 12 \]
\[ C = 73 - 12 \]
\[ C = 61 \]

Then, we use \( M = 73 \) to find \( S \) from the third equation:
\[ S = 73 + 23 \]
\[ S = 96 \]

Now, we have:
- Katarina has 68 cookies.
- Max has 73 cookies.
- The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.
- Summer has 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we sum these values:
\[ 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298 \]

Therefore, the total number of cookies they have is:
\[ \boxed{298} \]"
"To find the original length of the dress, we start with the equation that represents the final length after the extensions and additions. The final length of the dress is given as 140 cm, which is the sum of the original length plus 50% of the original length (which is \(0.5x\)) and an additional 20 cm. This can be written as:

\[ x + 0.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 1.5x + 20 = 140 \]

Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):

\[ 1.5x = 120 \]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \(x\):

\[ x = \frac{120}{1.5} \]
\[ x = 80 \]

Therefore, the original length of the dress was 80 cm."
"To determine the total time Chris took to mow the lawn by mowing half of it in ""turtle"" mode and the other half in ""rabbit"" mode, we can calculate the weighted average of the time intervals.

First, let's convert the times into a consistent unit. We'll use minutes:
- ""Turtle"" mode: 60 minutes
- ""Rabbit"" mode: 40 minutes

Since Chris mows half of the lawn in each mode, the time taken for each half is:
- Time for the first half (in ""turtle"" mode) = 60 minutes / 2 = 30 minutes.
- Time for the second half (in ""rabbit"" mode) = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes.

Now, we calculate the weighted average time:
\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{(30 \text{ minutes} \times 0.5) + (20 \text{ minutes} \times 0.5)}{1} = \frac{15 + 10}{1} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

However, this calculation seems to have an error because it doesn't match the provided options. Let's re-evaluate the weighted average correctly:

\[
\text{Total time} = \frac{(60 \text{ minutes} \times 0.5) + (40 \text{ minutes} \times 0.5)}{1} = \frac{30 + 20}{1} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is 50 minutes.

\[
\boxed{50}

"Greta bakes 30 cookies, and Celinda bakes twice as many, which is 60 cookies. Together, they have 30 + 60 = 90 cookies. After eating 10 cookies, the number of cookies left in the box is 90 - 10 = 80. Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is 80."
"To solve the problem, we start with the given conditions:
1. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet: \( T = Tr + 7 \).
2. The combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44: \( 2T + 3Tr = 44 \).

Substituting \( T = Tr + 7 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2(Tr + 7) + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 2Tr + 14 + 3Tr = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr + 14 = 44 \]
\[ 5Tr = 30 \]
\[ Tr = 6 \]

Now, substituting \( Tr = 6 \) back into \( T = Tr + 7 \):
\[ T = 6 + 7 \]
\[ T = 13 \]

Therefore, one of the twins is 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 13 \]"
John has 100 minutes to nap.
"To solve the problem, we start by determining the cost of one candy. Given that five lollipops cost $2.00 (since each lollipop costs $0.40), and the total cost of five lollipops and four candies is $3.20, we can find the cost of one candy by subtracting the cost of the lollipops from the total cost and then dividing by the number of candies.

The cost of four candies is:
\[ 3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20 \]

Thus, the cost of one candy is:
\[ c = \frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies. The cost of 10 lollipops is:
\[ 10 \times 0.40 = 4.00 \]

The cost of 10 candies is:
\[ 10 \times 0.30 = 3.00 \]

Adding these together gives the total cost:
\[ 4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00 \]

Therefore, the total cost for 10 lollipops and 10 candies is:
\[ \boxed{7.00} \]"
"To determine the total number of coins Rong and Neil have after ten years, we will follow a structured approach:

1. **Calculate the number of coins Rong saves per month:**
   Rong saves 20 coins per month.

2. **Determine the number of coins Neil saves per month:**
   Neil saves \(\frac{2}{5}\) times more coins than Rong per month. Therefore, Neil saves:
   \[
   20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of coins each saves over ten years:**
   There are 12 months in a year, so in ten years, there are:
   \[
   10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
   \]
   Rong saves:
   \[
   20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
   \]
   Neil saves:
   \[
   28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
   \]

4. **Sum the total coins saved by both Rong and Neil:**
   The total number of coins saved by both is:
   \[
   2400 + 3360 = 5760
   \]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5760}

"John brings his dog to the vet. The cost of 2 vaccines, each priced at $20, totals $40. The heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill. Let's denote the total bill as \( T \). Given that the heartworm check is 60% of \( T \), we have:

\[ x = 0.6T \]

Since the total bill is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[ T = 40 + x \]

Substituting \( x \) in the total bill equation:

\[ T = 40 + 0.6T \]

Rearranging to solve for \( T \):

\[ T - 0.6T = 40 \]
\[ 0.4T = 40 \]
\[ T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \]

So, the total bill is $100. John brought $125 with him. The amount he leaves with is:

\[ 125 - 100 = 25 \]

Therefore, the amount John leaves with is **$25**."
"To determine the price of a crate of fruit, we need to calculate the cost of each type of fruit in the crate and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - Each crate contains 5 bananas.
   - The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple.
   - Given that one apple costs $0.5, one banana costs \(2 \times 0.5 = $1.0\).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 bananas is \(5 \times 1.0 = $5.0\).

2. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Each crate contains 12 apples.
   - The price of one apple is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 12 apples is \(12 \times 0.5 = $6.0\).

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Each crate contains 7 oranges.
   - The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana.
   - Given that one banana costs $1.0, one orange costs \(3 \times 1.0 = $3.0\).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 7 oranges is \(7 \times 3.0 = $21.0\).

4. **Total Cost of the Crate:**
   - Summing the costs of bananas, apples, and oranges:
   \[
   5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0
   \]

Thus, the price for such a crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32.0}\)."
"To determine the total area of Brittany's quilted comforter, we first need to find the number of each color of square on the comforter and then calculate the total area.

   - Given: 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Calculation: \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) blue squares.

3. **Green Squares:**
   - Given: 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   - Calculation: \( 18 + 6 = 24 \) green squares.

4. **White Squares:**
   - Given: 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   - Calculation: \( 24 - 12 = 12 \) white squares.

Next, we sum the number of each color of square to find the total number of squares on the comforter:
\[
14 \text{ (red)} + 18 \text{ (blue)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 12 \text{ (white)} = 68 \text{ squares}
\]

Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, each square has an area of 1 square foot. Therefore, the total area of the comforter is:

"To determine the number of additional chairs needed, we start by calculating the total number of chairs required for the function. There are 42 adults and 15 babies, making a total of:

\[ 42 + 15 = 57 \text{ people} \]

Next, we know the restaurant has 8 high chairs, and these are 5 times the number of regular chairs. Therefore, the number of regular chairs is:

\[ \frac{8}{5} = 1.6 \text{ regular chairs per high chair} \]

However, since the number of chairs must be a whole number, we directly use the given 8 high chairs and calculate the total number of chairs available:

\[ 8 \text{ (high chairs)} + 40 \text{ (regular chairs)} = 48 \text{ chairs} \]

To find out how many more chairs are needed, we subtract the number of chairs available from the total number of people:

\[ 57 - 48 = 9 \]

Thus, the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get is:

\[ \boxed{9} \]"
"To find the number of 8-point bucks, we start by calculating the number of bucks, which is 50 percent of the total deer. Given there are 50 deer in the field:

\[ \text{Number of bucks} = 50\% \times 50 = 0.50 \times 50 = 25 \]

Next, we determine how many of these bucks are 8 points. Since 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points:

\[ \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of 8-point bucks is:

\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To determine the total points collected by the class, we start by calculating the points collected by each student:

1. **Adam** has collected 50 points.
2. **Betty** collected 30% more points than Adam. Therefore, the points collected by Betty are:
   \[
   \text{Points collected by Betty} = 50 + (0.30 \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
   \]
3. **Marta** collected 3 times more points than Tom. Since Tom has 30 points, the points collected by Marta are:
   \[
   \text{Points collected by Marta} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]
4. **Tom** has 30 points.

Now, we sum up the points collected by all the students:
\[
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 90 + 30 = 235
\]

The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points. To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the minimum threshold:
\[
\text{Points missing} = 400 - 235 = 165
\]

Thus, the class is missing \(\boxed{165}\) points to go on the trip."

"Greta's total paycheck is $2400.00. She allocates 50% of her paycheck to her retirement account, which amounts to:

\[ 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200 \]

After funding her retirement account, the remaining amount is:

\[ 2400 - 1200 = 1200 \]

Next, she uses 20% of her original paycheck for her monthly car payment, which is:

\[ 0.20 \times 2400 = 480 \]

Subtracting the car payment from the remaining amount after retirement contributions gives:

\[ 1200 - 480 = 720 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Greta has left to spend is $720.00.

The final numerical answer is:

\[
20 - 4 = 16
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pairs of pencils are in the box. Since each pair consists of 2 pencils, we divide the number of pencils by 2:

\[
16 \div 2 = 8
\]

Therefore, the number of pairs of pencils in the box is \(\boxed{8}\)."
"To determine the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we start by calculating the total number of fireworks in the display. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each:

\[ 15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ fireworks} \]

"To determine how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we start by defining the capacities of the trucks. Let's denote the capacities of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks as \( G_s \), \( G_o \), and \( G_g \) respectively. According to the problem:

- \( G_s = 4000 \) pounds
- \( G_o = G_s + 800 = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \) pounds
- The combined capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds, so \( G_s + G_o + G_g = 11600 \).

Substituting the known values into the equation:

\[ 4000 + 4800 + G_g = 11600 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 8800 + G_g = 11600 \]

Solving for \( G_g \):

\[ G_g = 11600 - 8800 \]
\[ G_g = 2800 \]

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry \(\boxed{2800}\) pounds of gravel."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and understanding the relationships given in the question.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( F \) represent the number of dumplings each female ate.
   - According to the problem, \( F = 3 \).

2. **Determine the number of dumplings each male ate:**
   - Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
   - Therefore, each male ate \( F + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 \) dumplings.

3. **Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females:**
   - There are 6 females.
   - Each female ate 3 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by females = \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \).

4. **Calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males:**
   - There are 8 males.
   - Each male ate 4 dumplings.
   - Total dumplings eaten by males = \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \).

5. **Calculate the total number of dumplings cooked:**
   - Total dumplings cooked = Total dumplings eaten by females + Total dumplings eaten by males.
   - Total dumplings cooked = \( 18 + 32 = 50 \).

Thus, the total number of dumplings Larry cooked is:

"To determine how far Martha's turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we start by understanding the relationship between the cat's and turtle's speeds. Given that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat runs at a speed of 15 feet per second, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

First, calculate the turtle's speed:
\[
\text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we use the formula for distance, which is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the turtle's speed and the given time:
\[
\text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many total hours the firefighters need to raise the remaining amount to reach their goal, we start by calculating the amount raised per hour. They raised $2100 in 3 hours, so the amount raised per hour is:

\[ \text{Amount per hour} = \frac{2100}{3} = 700 \]

Next, we determine the remaining amount needed to reach the goal of $6300:

\[ \text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \]

To find out how many additional hours are needed to raise the remaining amount, we divide the remaining amount by the amount raised per hour:

\[ \text{Additional hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \]

Adding the initial 3 hours to the additional hours gives us the total number of hours required:

\[ \text{Total hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of hours they have to fundraise in total to reach their goal is:

"To determine the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the percentage of water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
   - 80% of this 40% is used for industrial purposes.
   - Calculate 80% of 40%:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40\% = 0.80 \times 0.40 = 0.32 = 32\%
     \]

2. **Calculate the percentage of water used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes:**
   - The total percentage of water used by Colorado City is 40%.
   - Subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes (32%) from the total percentage used by Colorado City:
     \[
     40\% - 32\% = 8\%

"To determine the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we first calculate the production rates for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

For chocolate ice cream:
- The factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, so the production rate is \( \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts per hour} \).
- In 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 50 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 2400 \text{ quarts} \).

For vanilla ice cream:
- The factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, so the production rate is \( \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts per hour} \).
- In 48 hours, the factory would produce \( 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} \times 48 \text{ hours} = 600 \text{ quarts} \).

Adding the quarts of both types of ice cream produced in 48 hours:
\[ 2400 \text{ quarts} + 600 \text{ quarts} = 3000 \text{ quarts} \]

Thus, the total quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours is \( 3000 \)."

"To determine the number of slices of pizza left, we start by calculating the total number of slices ordered. Since there are 5 people and each pizza has 12 slices, the total number of slices is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the slices eaten by Bryce and two of his friends. They ate \(\frac{2}{3}\) of their pizzas. Since each pizza has 12 slices, the number of slices they ate is:

\[ 3 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices} \]

Then, we calculate the slices eaten by the two remaining friends. They ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of their pizzas. The number of slices they ate is:

\[ 2 \text{ pizzas} \times \frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices} \]

Adding the slices eaten by Bryce and his friends, we get the total number of slices eaten:

"To determine the number of boxes of graham crackers needed, we start by calculating the total number of smores required. There are 9 kids, each wanting 2 smores, and 6 adults, each wanting 1 smore. This gives us:

\[ 9 \text{ kids} \times 2 \text{ smores per kid} + 6 \text{ adults} \times 1 \text{ smore per adult} = 18 \text{ smores} + 6 \text{ smores} = 24 \text{ smores} \]

Each sleeve of graham crackers makes the base for 8 large smores. Therefore, the number of sleeves needed is:

\[ \frac{24 \text{ smores}}{8 \text{ smores per sleeve}} = 3 \text{ sleeves} \]

Since each box contains 3 sleeves, the number of boxes needed is:

\[ \frac{3 \text{ sleeves}}{3 \text{ sleeves per box}} = 1 \text{ box} \]

Thus, the number of boxes of graham crackers needed is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we start by calculating the ages based on the given information.

First, we determine Dora's father's age. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, we calculate:

"To determine the number of votes candidate C received, we start by calculating the votes for candidate A, who got 20% of the total votes. Given that there were 100 voters:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \]

Next, we calculate the votes for candidate B, who received 50% more votes than candidate A. Therefore:

\[ \text{Additional votes for candidate B} = 50\% \times 20 = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \]

So, the total votes for candidate B are:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate B} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Now, to find the votes for candidate C, we subtract the votes for candidates A and B from the total number of votes:

\[ \text{Votes for candidate C} = 100 - (20 + 30) = 100 - 50 = 50 \]

Thus, the number of votes candidate C received is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"

   - Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes: \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) ounces.

4. Sum the water used for all the cubes:
   - Total water used: \(12 + 14 + 4 = 30\) ounces.

5. Subtract the total water used from the initial amount of water:
   - Initial amount of water: 32 ounces.
   - Water left: \(32 - 30 = 2\) ounces.

Therefore, the number of ounces of water Peter has left is \(\boxed{2}\)."
"To determine how many more books Clara has than Alice, we start by finding out how many books Steven has. Given that Clara has 20 books and she has two times as many books as Steven, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2 \times \text{Steven's books} = 20 \]

Solving for Steven's books:

\[ \text{Steven's books} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Next, we calculate the number of books Alice has, knowing that Alice has 6 more books than Steven:

\[ \text{Alice's books} = \text{Steven's books} + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16 \]

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:

\[ \text{Clara's books} - \text{Alice's books} = 20 - 16 = 4 \]

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the total number of students and the number of students with specific hobbies.

1. **Total number of students**: 50
2. **Students who like to bake**: 10
3. **Students who like to play basketball**: 5

The number of students who like to play video games or play music is the remainder after accounting for those who like to bake and play basketball:
\[ 50 - 10 - 5 = 35 \]

Given that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number who like to play basketball, we can express this relationship as:
\[ M = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Since the total number of students who like to play video games or play music is 35, we can set up the equation:
\[ V + M = 35 \]
Substituting the value of \(M\):
\[ V + 10 = 35 \]
Solving for \(V\):
\[ V = 35 - 10 = 25 \]

Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \(25\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{25} \]"

"To determine the number of boys in each class, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of students in each class:**
   - The total number of students in the two classes is 80.
   - Since each class has the same number of students, we divide the total number of students by 2:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
     \]

2. **Determine the number of girls in each class:**
   - In each class, 40% of the students are girls.
   - To find the number of girls in each class, we calculate 40% of 40:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls in each class} = 0.40 \times 40 = 16
     \]

3. **Determine the number of boys in each class:**
   - Since the total number of students in each class is 40 and 16 of them are girls, the remaining students must be boys.
   - We subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
     \]

Thus, the number of boys in each class is \(\boxed{24}\)."

"To determine the profit Mark made, we start by calculating the total cost of the packs he bought. He purchased 3 packs at $1800 each:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total value of the cards he received. He got one card worth $4000, another card worth $1000, and 30 cards each worth $50. The value of these cards is:

\[
\text{Value of the $4000 card} = 4000 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Value of the $1000 card} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Value of the 30 cards worth $50 each} = 30 \times 50 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding these values together gives the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Total value of the cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500 \text{ dollars}
\]

To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total value of the cards:

\[
\text{Profit} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the profit Mark made is:

\[
\boxed{1100}

\[ 76 - 48 = 28 \]

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save \(\boxed{28}\) dollars by choosing the second amusement park over the first."
"To determine the weekly savings, we start by calculating the daily savings from switching vendors. The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each and now buys them for $0.4 each, selling 500 tomatoes a day.

1. **Daily cost from the old vendor:**
   \[
   500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.5/\text{tomato} = \$250/\text{day}
   \]

2. **Daily cost from the new vendor:**
   \[
   500 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times \$0.4/\text{tomato} = \$200/\text{day}
   \]

3. **Daily savings:**
   \[
   \$250/\text{day} - \$200/\text{day} = \$50/\text{day}
   \]

4. **Weekly savings:**

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

1. Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
3. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.

First, we calculate the number of marbles Carl has:
\[ \text{Number of marbles Carl has} = 4 \times \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = 4 \times 56 = 224 \]

Next, we determine the number of marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal:
\[ \text{Number of marbles Sean has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of marbles Cal has} \]
\[ 56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of marbles Cal has} \]
\[ \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 2 \times 56 = 112 \]

Finally, we find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have:
\[ \text{Combined number of marbles} = \text{Number of marbles Carl has} + \text{Number of marbles Cal has} = 224 + 112 = 336 \]

Therefore, the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have is 336."
"To determine how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups from 54 students, we start by calculating the number of students per group if the activity is divided into 12 groups:

1. Calculate the number of students per group if there are 12 groups:
   \[
   \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{12 \text{ groups}} = 4.5 \text{ students per group}
   \]

Since the number of students per group must be a whole number, it is not possible to divide 54 students into 12 groups of equal size. Therefore, the activity can only be divided into 6 groups of equal size.

2. Calculate the number of students per group if there are 6 groups:
   \[
   \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group}
   \]

Since 9 is a whole number, it is possible to divide 54 students into 6 groups of 9 students each.

3. Determine how many more groups are needed to form 12 groups:
   \[
   \text{Number of additional groups needed} = 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ groups}
   \]

Thus, the number of additional groups needed is 6.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}

"To determine the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months, we'll break down the rental pattern and calculate accordingly.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented in a single 4-week month:
- There are 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days in a week.
- Therefore, in a 4-week month, there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) weekdays and \(2 \times 4 = 8\) weekend days.

Next, we calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends in one 4-week month:
- Total chairs rented during weekdays in one 4-week month: \(60 \text{ chairs/day} \times 20 \text{ days} = 1200 \text{ chairs}\).
- Total chairs rented during weekends in one 4-week month: \(100 \text{ chairs/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ chairs}\).

Adding these together gives the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month:
\[1200 \text{ chairs} + 800 \text{ chairs} = 2000 \text{ chairs}\].

Since we are asked about two 4-week months, we multiply the total number of chairs rented in one 4-week month by 2:
\[2000 \text{ chairs} \times 2 = 4000 \text{ chairs}\].

Thus, the total number of chairs Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months is:
\[
\boxed{4000}

Therefore, the number of bananas Gunther found in the pile is 43."
"To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we start by calculating the monthly cost per roommate. Given that the total monthly cost is $100 and there are 4 roommates, we divide $100 by 4:

\[
\text{Monthly cost per roommate} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
\]

Next, to find the annual cost per roommate, we multiply the monthly cost by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):

\[
\text{Annual cost per roommate} = 25 \times 12 = 300
\]

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity."
"To determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we start by calculating the total number of each item he initially sent.

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses, which is \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.
- 4 dozen plates, which is \(4 \times 12 = 48\) plates.

Next, we account for the items that were returned broken:
- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

To find out how many glasses and plates are left, we subtract the broken items from the total items sent:

\[
\text{Remaining glasses} = 96 - 10 = 86
\]
\[
\text{Remaining plates} = 48 - 6 = 42
\]

Finally, we sum the remaining glasses and plates to get the total number of items Jeff has now:

\[
\text{Total remaining items} = 86 \text{ glasses} + 42 \text{ plates} = 128 \text{ items}
\]

Therefore, the total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now is \(\boxed{128}\)."
"To determine the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end, we will follow a detailed step-by-step process:

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

2. **Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of small stickers traded: \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
   - Since each small sticker is worth one small button, she trades 27 small stickers for 27 large buttons.

3. **Remaining Small Stickers:**
   - Remaining small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \) small stickers.

4. **Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - Number of large stickers traded: \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
   - Since each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons, trading 20 large stickers for large buttons gives her 20 large buttons.

5. **Remaining Large Stickers:**
   - Remaining large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \) large stickers.

6. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she trades 20 large stickers for \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

7. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons from trading small stickers: 27
   - Large buttons from trading large stickers: 20
   - Small buttons from trading large stickers: 60
   - Total buttons: \( 27 + 20 + 60 = 107 \)

Thus, by the end, Lorraine has 107 buttons. The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{107}\)."

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables. Let \( x \) represent the number of votes against the new regulation. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against, so the number of votes in favor is \( 2x \).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes in favor and the votes against, which gives us the equation:
\[ x + 2x = 33 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ 3x = 33 \]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ x = \frac{33}{3} = 11 \]

So, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11. The number of votes in favor is \( 2x \):
\[ 2x = 2 \times 11 = 22 \]

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.

"To determine the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we will calculate the number of students requiring each size of shirt and then sum these numbers.

1. **Extra-small (XS) shirts:**
   - Number of students needing XS shirts = 11

2. **Small (S) shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra small.
   - Number of students needing S shirts = 2 * 11 = 22

3. **Medium (M) shirts:**
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Number of students needing M shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

4. **Large (L) shirts:**
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Number of students needing L shirts = 18 / 2 = 9

5. **Extra-large (XL) shirts:**
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Number of students needing XL shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Now, we sum up the number of students needing each size of shirt to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order:

\[
\text{Total shirts} = \text{XS} + \text{S} + \text{M} + \text{L} + \text{XL}

"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of cases of shingles needed for the second house as \( x \).

Given:
- The first house needs \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the second house, so the first house needs \( \frac{1}{2}x \) cases.
- The third house needs double the first house, so the third house needs \( 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = x \) cases.

The total number of cases of shingles needed for all three houses is 250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = 250 \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ \frac{1}{2}x + x + x = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x + \frac{2}{2}x = \frac{5}{2}x = 250 \]

To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ 5x = 500 \]

Then, we divide both sides by 5:
\[ x = 100 \]

So, the second house needs 100 cases of shingles. The third house needs double the first house, which is:
\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2}x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 100 \]

Therefore, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.

The final numerical answer is:

     \]

So, Sam would have to spend **60 dollars** to make 4 liters of juice."
"To find the total number of books read by Ezra and Ahmed, we start with the information given:

1. Ezra read 300 books initially.
2. Ezra decided to read 150 more books.
3. Therefore, the total number of books Ezra read is \(300 + 150 = 450\).

Ahmed read half the number of books Ezra read in one hour, which is \(300 / 2 = 150\).

Adding the books read by both Ezra and Ahmed, we get:
\[ 450 + 150 = 600 \]

Thus, the total number of books they read altogether is \(\boxed{600}\)."
"To determine Tanya's total earnings for teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we'll break down her earnings day by day.

**Monday:**
- Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours each day.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She earns an additional $5 per day if she teaches more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Monday:
\[ \text{Base earnings} = 4 \text{ classes} \times 5 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 4 \times 5 \times 15 = \$300 \]

Since she teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3 classes, she qualifies for the additional $5:
\[ \text{Total earnings for Monday} = \$300 + \$5 = \$305 \]

**Wednesday:**
- Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours each day.
- She earns $15 per hour.
- She does not qualify for the additional $5 per day since she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3 classes.

First, calculate the base earnings for Wednesday:
\[ \text{Base earnings} = 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times \$15/\text{hour} = 2 \times 2 \times 15 = \$60 \]

Since she does not qualify for the additional $5 per day, her total earnings for Wednesday are:
\[ \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \$60 \]

**Total earnings for both days:**
\[ \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total earnings for Monday} + \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \$305 + \$60 = \$365 \]

Therefore, Tanya earned a total of \(\boxed{365}\) dollars for these two days of teaching."
"To find out how many more vanilla scents sold compared with the fruity scents, we start by calculating the total sales for each type of scent.

For vanilla scents:
\[ 5 \text{ vanilla scents/sale} \times 5 \text{ sales} = 25 \text{ vanilla scents} \]

For fruity scents:
\[ 2 \text{ fruity scents/sale} \times 2 \text{ sales} = 4 \text{ fruity scents} \]

Now, to find the difference:
\[ 25 \text{ vanilla scents} - 4 \text{ fruity scents} = 21 \text{ more vanilla scents sold} \]

Therefore, the number of vanilla scents sold is 21 more than the number of fruity scents sold. The final answer is:
\[ 21 \]"
"To determine the price per ear of corn that Bennet needs to sell in order to make a total of $135, we can set up the following equation:

Let \( x \) be the price per ear of corn. Bennet has already made $60 from selling 20 eggplants at $3 each. The remaining amount he needs to make is $135 - $60 = $75. Since he has 25 ears of corn, the equation to find \( x \) is:

\[ 25x = 75 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{75}{25} = 3 \]

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \$3 \]"
"To determine the percentage of her weekend Tatiana spends playing soccer, we start by calculating the total available time over the weekend:

\[ 7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the time she spends reading:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Then, we calculate the time she spends playing video games, which is one-third of the remaining time:

\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 9 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Subtracting the time spent on video games from the remaining time gives us the time spent playing soccer:

\[ 9 \text{ hours} - 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

To find the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \left( \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{12 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 50\% \]

Therefore, the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer is:

\[ \boxed{50\%} \]"
"To determine how many pencils Anthony kept, we start with the initial number of pencils he had, which is 50.

First, Anthony gave half of his pencils to Brandon:
\[
\text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
\]
After giving 25 pencils to Brandon, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:
\[
50 - 25 = 25
\]

Next, Anthony gave three-fifths of the remaining pencils to Charlie:
\[
\text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
\]
After giving 15 pencils to Charlie, the number of pencils Anthony has left is:
\[
25 - 15 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of pencils Anthony kept is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time spent driving and the time spent at the museum.

First, let's calculate the time Jack spends driving to the museum. The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and he drives at a speed of 75 mph. The time taken to drive to the museum is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

So, the time to drive to the museum is:

\[ \text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Since the return trip is the same distance and speed, the time to drive back home is also 2 hours. Therefore, the total driving time is:

\[ \text{Total driving time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time Jack is gone from home is the sum of the driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[ \text{Total time gone} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours} \]

So, the final numerical answer is:

\[ 10 \]"
"To determine the number of wheels left after Henry assembles the cars and motorcycles, we start by calculating the total number of wheels required. 

First, we calculate the wheels needed for the cars:
\[ 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels per car} = 228 \text{ wheels} \]

Next, we calculate the wheels needed for the motorcycles:
\[ 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels per motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of wheels required:
\[ 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels} \]

Given that Henry has 650 wheels, we subtract the total wheels required from the total wheels available to find the number of wheels left:
\[ 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels} \]

Thus, the number of wheels left is:
\[ 276 \]"
"To calculate the price after a 20% discount on a laptop that originally costs $1000, we first determine the discount amount:

\[ 20\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200 \]

Subtracting this discount from the original price gives:

\[ 1000 - 200 = 800 \]

Therefore, after applying the 20% discount, the price you have to pay is $800.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 800 \]"
"To determine the cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of movies in series:
\[ \text{Number of series movies} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \]

Next, we find the number of non-series movies:
\[ \text{Number of non-series movies} = 600 - 200 = 400 \]

Then, we determine the number of older movies among the non-series movies:
\[ \text{Number of older movies} = 0.4 \times 400 = 160 \]

The remaining non-series movies are not older:
\[ \text{Number of non-older non-series movies} = 400 - 160 = 240 \]

Now, we calculate the cost for each type of movie:
- The cost for the series movies is $6 each:
\[ \text{Cost for series movies} = 200 \times 6 = 1200 \]
- The cost for the non-older non-series movies is $10 each:
\[ \text{Cost for non-older non-series movies} = 240 \times 10 = 2400 \]
- The cost for the older movies is $5 each:
\[ \text{Cost for older movies} = 160 \times 5 = 800 \]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = 1200 + 2400 + 800 = 4400 \]

Therefore, the total cost to replace the movies is:
\[ \boxed{4400} \]"

"To determine the total distance to the vacation spot, we need to calculate the distance driven and the distance hiked separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the distance driven:
- The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at an average speed of 50 miles per hour.
- Distance driven = Speed × Time = 50 miles/hour × 6 hours = 300 miles.

Next, let's calculate the distance hiked:
- The Llesis family hiked for 1.5 hours.
- The average speed when hiking is 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- Half of the driving speed is 50 miles per hour / 2 = 25 miles per hour.
- Therefore, the hiking speed is 25 miles per hour - 5 miles per hour = 20 miles per hour.
- Distance hiked = Speed × Time = 20 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles.

Finally, the total distance to the vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
- Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles.

The final numerical answer is 330 miles."
"To determine the difference in scores between Ava and Emma, we start by defining the variables and the points they earn:

- Let \( E_A \) be the number of enemies Ava jumps on.
- Let \( E_E \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( B_A \) be the number of berries Ava collects.
- Let \( B_E \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( T_A \) be the time left for Ava.
- Let \( T_E \) be the time left for Emma.

Given:
1. Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E_A = E_E + 8 \)
2. Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( B_A = B_E + 3 \)
3. Ava finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma: \( T_A = T_E + 4 \)

The points calculation for each player:
- Points from enemies: \( 10 \times (E_A - E_E) = 10 \times 8 = 80 \)
- Points from berries: \( 5 \times (B_A - B_E) = 5 \times 3 = 15 \)
- Points from time left: \( 30 \times (T_E - T_A) = 30 \times (-4) = -120 \)

Now, let's calculate the total scores for both players:
- Ava's total score: \( 80 + 15 - 120 = -25 \)
- Emma's total score: \( 10 \times (-8) + 5 \times (-3) + 30 \times (-4) = -80 - 15 - 120 = -215 \)

The difference between their scores is:
\[ \text{Difference} = -25 - (-215) = -25 + 215 = 190 \]

Thus, the difference between their scores is \( 190 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{190} \]"
"To find the cost of each of the other two pizzas, we start with the total cost of all four pizzas, which is 64 dollars. We know that two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars each, so their combined cost is 60 dollars. Subtracting this from the total cost gives us the combined cost of the other two pizzas:
\[ 64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars} \]
Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:
\[ \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars} \]
Therefore, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find out how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week, we'll break down the problem step by step.

First, we calculate the number of rides they have on the usual days:
- They ride their bikes 3 times a day.
- They do this for 5 days.

So, the total number of rides on the usual days is:
\[ 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides} \]

Next, we calculate the number of rides they have on the other two days:
- On these days, they ride twice the usual number of times.
- The usual number of rides per day is 3, so twice that is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) rides per day.
- They do this for 2 days.

So, the total number of rides on the other two days is:
\[ 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides} \]

Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the other two days to get the total number of rides in a week:
\[ 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides} \]

Therefore, the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week is:

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the given conditions. Let \( o \) represent the number of orange fish Bob bought, and \( w \) represent the number of white fish he bought. We know the following:

1. The total number of fish Bob bought is 17, so:
\[ o + w = 17 \]

2. After adding the new fish to his pond, the number of orange fish becomes \( 3 + o \) and the number of white fish becomes \( 4 + w \). According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish, so:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( o + w = 17 \)
2. \( 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \)

Let's solve the second equation first:
\[ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) \]
\[ 3 + o = 8 + 2w \]
\[ o - 2w = 5 \]
\[ o = 2w + 5 \]

Next, substitute \( o = 2w + 5 \) into the first equation:
\[ 2w + 5 + w = 17 \]
\[ 3w + 5 = 17 \]
\[ 3w = 12 \]
\[ w = 4 \]

Now, substitute \( w = 4 \) back into the equation \( o = 2w + 5 \):
\[ o = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]

We can verify the solution:
- The total number of fish bought is \( o + w = 13 + 4 = 17 \).
- After adding the fish, the number of orange fish is \( 3 + 13 = 16 \) and the number of white fish is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).
- The number of orange fish is indeed twice the number of white fish: \( 16 = 2 \times 8 \).

Thus, the number of white fish Bob bought is \(\boxed{4}\)."
"To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we start by calculating the total distance he drives in a week. Since he drives 5 miles one way and he makes a round trip each day from Monday to Friday, the round trip distance per day is:

\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles/day} \]

Given that he drives from Monday to Friday, the total distance driven in a week is:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week} \]

Next, we calculate the amount of fuel consumed in a week. With a fuel efficiency of 10 miles per gallon, the gallons of gas used per week is:

\[ \frac{50 \text{ miles/week}}{10 \text{ miles/gallon}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week} \]

Finally, to find out the cost of the gas used in a week, we multiply the gallons of gas by the price per gallon. If the price of gas is $3 per gallon, the cost per week is:

\[ 5 \text{ gallons/week} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Therefore, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is:

\[ 15 \text{ dollars/week} \]

The final numerical answer is:

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is:
\[ \boxed{155} \]"
"To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his garden, we start by calculating the total yield from the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately.

First, we calculate the total yield from the tomato plants:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants.

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
\]

Next, we calculate the total yield from the eggplant plants:
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 8 eggplant plants.

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
\]

Now, we sum the total number of tomatoes and eggplants to find the total number of fruits:

"To determine the number of OLED TVs sold, we start by calculating the number of smart TVs and analog TVs sold based on the given fractions of the total sales.

Given:
- Total sales = 40 TVs
- One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs.
- One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs.

First, calculate the number of smart TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the number of analog TVs sold:
\[
\text{Number of analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
\]

Now, we find the number of OLED TVs sold by subtracting the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total sales:
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Number of smart TVs} + \text{Number of analog TVs})
\]
\[
\text{Number of OLED TVs} = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
\]

Thus, the number of OLED TVs sold is:
\[
\boxed{25}

"To determine Jamie's total earnings for working 11 hours on last Tuesday, we need to break down her pay into regular hours and overtime hours.

First, let's identify the regular and overtime hours:
- Regular hours: 8 hours
- Overtime hours: 11 - 8 = 3 hours

Next, we calculate the earnings for the regular hours:
\[ \text{Earnings from regular hours} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Then, we calculate the earnings for the overtime hours. Since the overtime rate is 150% of the regular rate, the overtime rate is:
\[ \text{Overtime rate} = 20 \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Now, we calculate the earnings for the overtime hours:
\[ \text{Earnings from overtime hours} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, we add the earnings from the regular hours and the overtime hours to find the total earnings for the day:
\[ \text{Total earnings} = 160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars} \]

1. **Determine the number of employees after three months:**
   - The company hires 20 new employees every month.
   - After three months, the number of new employees hired is \( 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees} \).
   - The initial number of employees is 200.
   - Therefore, the total number of employees after three months is \( 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees} \).

2. **Calculate the total salary paid to all employees each month:**
   - Each employee is paid $4000 per month.
   - The total salary paid to all employees each month is \( 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \).

3. **Multiply the total salary per month by the number of months (three months):**
   - The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is \( 1040000 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 3120000 \text{ dollars} \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3120000 \]"
"To find the total time Carrie and the choir will be caroling, we need to add the time for ""Deck the Halls"" and ""Jingle Bells.""

First, calculate the total time for ""Deck the Halls"":
- ""Deck the Halls"" is sung twice, and each performance is 150 seconds long.
\[
2 \times 150 = 300 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, calculate the total time for ""Jingle Bells"":
- ""Jingle Bells"" is sung once, and each performance is 240 seconds long.
\[
1 \times 240 = 240 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, add the total times for both songs:
\[
300 \text{ seconds} + 240 \text{ seconds} = 540 \text{ seconds}
\]

Therefore, the total time they will be caroling is **540 seconds**."
"To determine how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to calculate their hourly wages and then their earnings for 20 hours.

First, let's find Billy's hourly wage at each stage:
1. **Initial hourly wage:** $10 per hour.
2. **After 2 months, the raise:** $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary, the raise:** $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

Next, we calculate Billy's earnings for 20 hours at each stage:
1. **Initial earnings (first 2 months):**
   \[
   10 \text{ hours/month} \times 2 \text{ months} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 400 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. **Earnings after the raise (first anniversary):**
   \[
   11.50 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 230 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up Billy's total earnings:
\[
400 \text{ dollars} + 230 \text{ dollars} = 630 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate Sally's hourly wage:
1. **Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's initial salary:**
   \[
   10 + 0.50 = 10.50 \text{ dollars per hour}
   \]

We calculate Sally's earnings for 20 hours:
\[
10.50 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ hours} = 210 \text{ dollars}
\]

Finally, we find the difference in their earnings:
\[
630 \text{ dollars} - 210 \text{ dollars} = 420 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, Billy will earn $420 more than Sally in 20 hours. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{420}

"To determine how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels, we start by calculating the cost of the bread and the cost of the bagels separately.

First, the cost of 3 loaves of bread:
- Each loaf costs $2.
- Therefore, \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) dollars.

Next, the cost of 2 bagels:
- Each bagel costs $1.
- Therefore, \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) dollars.

To find out how much more the bread costs than the bagels, we subtract the total cost of the bagels from the total cost of the bread:
- The difference is \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) dollars.

Thus, 3 loaves of bread cost 4 dollars more than 2 bagels. The final answer is 4."
"To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we start by calculating Nikita's score. Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. Pierson scored 278 points.

First, we calculate half of Pierson's score:
\[ \text{Half of Pierson's score} = \frac{278}{2} = 139 \]

Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's score:
\[ \text{Nikita's score} = 139 + 11 = 150 \]

Now, we add Pierson's score and Nikita's score to find the total points:
\[ \text{Total points} = 278 + 150 = 428 \]

Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is 428."
"To determine the total number of trees planted, we start by calculating the total number of students and teachers at Ashley's school.

Given:
- There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students per class.
- There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class.

First, calculate the total number of students:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 25 \text{ students/class} = 1000 \text{ students} \]

Next, calculate the total number of teachers:
\[ 40 \text{ classes} \times 3 \text{ teachers/class} = 120 \text{ teachers} \]

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is:
\[ 1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees} \]

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is:
\[ 120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees} \]

Adding the trees planted by students and teachers gives the total number of trees planted:
\[ 1000 \text{ trees} + 240 \text{ trees} = 1240 \text{ trees} \]

Therefore, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is:
\[ \boxed{1240} \]"

"To determine how many miles will separate the two cars after 2 hours, we need to calculate the distance each car travels in that time and then find the difference between those distances.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the first car:**
   - The first car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour.
   - Time traveled: 2 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 2 hours = 120 miles.

2. **Calculate the distance traveled by the second car:**
   - The second car travels at an average speed of 70 miles per hour.
   - Time traveled: 2 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 miles/hour × 2 hours = 140 miles.

3. **Find the difference in the distances traveled by the two cars:**
   - Distance traveled by the second car: 140 miles.
   - Distance traveled by the first car: 120 miles.
   - Difference = 140 miles - 120 miles = 20 miles.

After 2 hours, the second car will be 20 miles ahead of the first car.

The final numerical answer is:
20 miles"
"James buys a ring for his bride-to-be. The diamond costs $600 and the gold costs $300. He pays a 30% premium for it to be made. To find out how much he paid in total, we first calculate the total cost of the ring before the premium:

\[ \text{Total cost before premium} = \$600 + \$300 = \$900 \]

Next, we calculate the premium, which is 30% of the total cost before the premium:

\[ \text{Premium} = 30\% \times \$900 = 0.30 \times \$900 = \$270 \]

Finally, we add the premium to the total cost before the premium to find the total amount James paid:

\[ \text{Total cost after premium} = \$900 + \$270 = \$1170 \]

Therefore, the total amount James paid is **$1170**."
"To find the overall pass rate for Janet's collection of results from Herbert Hoover Elementary School's annual standardized test, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed and the total number of students tested.

First, let's determine the pass rates for each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Pass rate} = \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 \text{ or } 68\%
   \]

2. **Fourth-grade pass rate:**
   \[
   \text{Pass rate} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 \text{ or } 40\%
   \]

3. **Fifth-grade pass rate:**
   The fifth-grade pass rate is twice the fourth-grade pass rate:
   \[
   \text{Fifth-grade pass rate} = 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 \text{ or } 80\%
   \]

Next, we calculate the number of students who passed in each grade:

1. **Third-grade pass students:**
   \[
   \text{Number of third-grade pass students} = 340
   \]

2. **Fourth-grade pass students:**
   \[
   \text{Number of fourth-grade pass students} = 40
   \]

3. **Fifth-grade pass students:**
   \[
   \text{Number of fifth-grade pass students} = 0.80 \times 400 = 320
   \]

Now, we sum the number of students who passed in all grades:

\[
\text{Total number of pass students} = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700
\]

The total number of students tested is:

\[
\text{Total number of students} = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000
\]

Finally, we calculate the overall pass rate:

\[
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \text{ or } 70\%

"To determine how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we start by calculating the total number of glass chips he has. Given that each bag contains 72 chips and he has two bags, the total number of chips is:

\[ 72 \text{ chips/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 144 \text{ chips} \]

Next, we find out how many square inches of the mosaic Milo can make with 144 chips. Since it takes 12 chips to make every square inch, the number of square inches he can make is:

\[ \frac{144 \text{ chips}}{12 \text{ chips/square inch}} = 12 \text{ square inches} \]

Milo wants his mosaic to be three inches tall. To find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we use the fact that the area of the mosaic is the product of its length and height. Let \( L \) be the length of the mosaic in inches. The area of the mosaic is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times \text{height} = L \times 3 \text{ inches} \]

Since the area of the mosaic is 12 square inches, we have:

\[ L \times 3 = 12 \]

Solving for \( L \):

\[ L = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic 4 inches long. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 4 \]"
"To determine the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party, we first calculate the total tea consumed by the students. 

Each of the 4 students drank 1.5 quarts, so the total tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts} \]

Each of the 16 students drank 2 quarts, so the total tea consumed by these students is:
\[ 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts} \]

Adding these amounts together gives the total tea consumed:
\[ 6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts} \]

Since there are 10 quarts of tea left after the students drank, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ 38 + 10 = 48 \text{ quarts} \]

Given that there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert the total quarts to gallons:
\[ \frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To determine how many more butterscotch candies Dale needs to sell, we start with the following:

1. Dale initially ordered 100 candies.
2. He sold 150 candies, which means he ran out of his initial order and needed to order more.
3. Dale then ordered an additional 100 candies.
4. Now, Dale has a total of 200 candies (100 from the initial order + 100 from the additional order).
5. Dale has already sold 150 candies.

To find out how many more candies Dale needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he has already sold from the total number of candies he now has:
\[ 200 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (candies sold)} = 50 \text{ candies} \]

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 50 more candies to sell all of his candy.

The final numerical answer is:

   10
   \]

2. **Number of students at the end of each month:**
   - **End of January:**
     \[
     10 \times 2 = 20
     \]
   - **End of February:**
     \[
     20 \times 2 = 40
     \]
   - **End of March:**
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80
     \]
   - **End of April:**
     \[
     80 \times 2 = 160
     \]
   - **End of May:**
     \[
     160 \times 2 = 320
     \]

3. **Number of additional students by the end of May:**
   \[
   320 - 10 = 310

"To find out how many branches Felix climbed per day on average, we start with the total amount of money he made during the week, which is $105. Since he charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs, we can determine the total number of branches he climbed by dividing the total money made by the cost per branch:

\[
\text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{105}{0.25} = 420
\]

This total was made over the course of a week (7 days). To find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total branches by the number of days:

\[
\text{Branches climbed per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60
\]

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day. The final numerical answer is:

\[
60
\]"
"To find the total number of petals Rose picks initially:

1. For the first 3 flowers with 5 petals each: \(3 \times 5 = 15\) petals.
2. For the next 4 flowers with 6 petals each: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) petals.
3. For the next 5 flowers with 4 petals each: \(5 \times 4 = 20\) petals.
4. For the last 6 flowers with 7 petals each: \(6 \times 7 = 42\) petals.

Adding these together: \(15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101\) petals.

When Rose drops 1 flower of each type, she loses:
- 1 flower with 5 petals: \(1 \times 5 = 5\) petals.
- 1 flower with 6 petals: \(1 \times 6 = 6\) petals.
- 1 flower with 4 petals: \(1 \times 4 = 4\) petals.
- 1 flower with 7 petals: \(1 \times 7 = 7\) petals.

Total petals dropped: \(5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22\) petals.

Subtracting the dropped petals from the initial total: \(101 - 22 = 79\) petals.

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is \(\boxed{79}\)."
"John and DeSean bought a bag of 35 marshmallows. They used 18 marshmallows (9 each for John and DeSean) and dropped 3 more, making a total of 21 marshmallows used and dropped. Therefore, the number of marshmallows left is:
\[ 35 - 21 = 14 \]

With 14 marshmallows left, and since each S'more requires one marshmallow, each of them can have:
\[ \frac{14}{2} = 7 \]

So, the number of S'mores each can have with the remaining marshmallows is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To determine the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the total time played and then convert that into the number of quarters required.

First, let's calculate the total time played by each person:
- Jack plays for 20 minutes.
- Each of the two worse friends plays for 10 minutes each, so together they play for \(10 + 10 = 20\) minutes.
- The better friend plays for 30 minutes.

Adding these times together, the total time played is \(20 + 20 + 30 = 70\) minutes.

Since each quarter allows them to play for 20 minutes, the number of quarters needed is calculated by dividing the total time played by the time each quarter allows:
\[
\frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money used is 12 quarters. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the amount of oil Tanya uses, we start by setting up the relationships given in the problem as equations. Let's denote the amount of salt as \( S \), the amount of oil as \( O \), the amount of fragrance as \( F \), the amount of citrus zest as \( C \), and the amount of sugar as \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( S = G \) (same amount of salt as sugar)
2. \( F = C \) (same amount of fragrance as citrus zest)
3. \( O = 2S \) (twice as much oil as salt)
4. \( S = C \) (same amount of salt as citrus zest)

Since \( S = C \) and \( F = C \), we can substitute \( C \) with \( S \) and \( F \) with \( S \). Therefore, we have:
- \( O = 2S \)
- \( F = S \)
- \( C = S \)
- \( G = S \)

The total amount of the mixture is 10 ounces, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + O + F + C + G = 10 \]

Substituting the relationships into the equation, we get:
\[ S + 2S + S + S + S = 10 \]
\[ 6S = 10 \]
\[ S = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \]

Now, we need to find the amount of oil used, which is \( O = 2S \):
\[ O = 2 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Therefore, the amount of oil used is \( \frac{10}{3} \) ounces. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}

"To find out how much money John spent, we start by calculating the total cost of the goats and the cows separately.

First, the cost of the goats:
- John buys 3 goats, and each goat costs $500.
\[
3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, the cost of the cows:
- John buys 2 cows, and each cow costs $1500.
\[
2 \times 1500 = 3000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows to find the total amount spent:
\[
1500 + 3000 = 4500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent is **4500 dollars**."

\[ 63 - 48 = 15 \]

Therefore, Paul should buy 15 more cupcakes."
"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the initial number of cars Joe has:**
   - Robert has 20 cars.
   - Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
   - Therefore, Joe initially has \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cars.

2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells:**
   - Joe sells 20% of his cars.
   - 20% of 40 cars is \( 0.20 \times 40 = 8 \) cars.

3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother:**
   - Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold.
   - Therefore, he gives away \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \) cars.

4. **Calculate the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother:**
   - Joe initially has 40 cars.
   - He sells 8 cars, so he has \( 40 - 8 = 32 \) cars left.
   - He gives away 16 cars, so he has \( 32 - 16 = 16 \) cars left.

Thus, the number of cars Joe remains with after selling and giving some to his mother is 16.

The final answer is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To find out how much each student raised, we start by determining the total amount raised by the students. The total charity amount is $175,000, and $50,000 of this comes from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is:

\[ 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 \]

Next, we need to divide this amount by the number of students, which is 20:

\[ \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250 \]

Thus, each student raised $6,250. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 6250 \]"
"To find the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days, we start by noting the time she spent walking on the first day, which is 8 hours. On the second day, she walked half as many hours as the first day, which is 4 hours. Adding these times together gives us the total time in hours:

\[ 8 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we convert the total time from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the total hours by 60:

\[ 12 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 720 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 720 minutes.

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( P \) represent the number of cards PJ has.
- Smendrick has \( 3P \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 \) cards.

The total number of cards is given as 341. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341 \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \]
\[ 7P + 12 = 341 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides:
\[ 7P = 329 \]

Divide both sides by 7:
\[ P = 47 \]

Now, calculate the number of cards Smendrick and Becca have:
- Smendrick has \( 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 \) cards.
- Becca has \( 3P + 12 = 3 \times 47 + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 \) cards.

"To determine the total number of Easter eggs Cindy collected, we will break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Green Eggs**: Cindy has 5 green eggs.
2. **Blue Eggs**: She has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. Therefore, the number of blue eggs is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).
3. **Pink Eggs**: She has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs. Therefore, the number of pink eggs is \(10 - 1 = 9\).
4. **Yellow Eggs**: She has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. Therefore, the number of yellow eggs is \(\frac{9}{3} = 3\).

Now, we sum up all the eggs:
- Green eggs: 5
- Blue eggs: 10
- Pink eggs: 9
- Yellow eggs: 3

Total number of eggs:
\[ 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 \]

Thus, the total number of eggs Cindy has is \(\boxed{27}\)."
"To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and then subtract the refundable portion of the book's purchase price.

1. **Calculate the shipping cost:**
   - The cost per pound is $0.35.
   - The book weighs 4 pounds.
   - Therefore, the cost for the weight of the book is \(4 \times 0.35 = 1.40\) dollars.
   - The cost per mile is $0.08.
   - The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
   - Therefore, the cost for the distance is \(20 \times 0.08 = 1.60\) dollars.
   - The total shipping cost is \(1.40 + 1.60 = 3.00\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the refundable portion of the book's purchase price:**
   - The book cost $32.
   - Amazon will refund 75% of the purchase price.
   - Therefore, the refundable amount is \(32 \times 0.75 = 24.00\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the net loss:**
   - The total cost to Milly is the shipping cost plus the cost of the book.
   - The cost of the book is $32.
   - Therefore, the total cost is \(32 + 3.00 = 35.00\) dollars.
   - The net loss is the total cost minus the refundable amount.
   - Therefore, the net loss is \(35.00 - 24.00 = 11.00\) dollars.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{11}\)."

"To find out how many bars of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week, we start with the total monthly production and subtract the production from the first three weeks.

1. **First Week Production:** 8,000 bars
2. **Second Week Production:** Half of the first week, which is \( \frac{8,000}{2} = 4,000 \) bars
3. **Third Week Production:** Three times the first week, which is \( 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \) bars

Adding these up for the first three weeks:
\[ 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars} \]

Given that Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month, the production for the fourth week is:
\[ 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars} \]

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week."
"To determine the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we'll break down her activities and calculate the time spent on each.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 TikTok videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent on TikTok videos per week is:
     \[
     18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, the time spent writing songs per week is:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours/week} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup.
   - Therefore, the time spent on makeup per week is:
     \[
     15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

4. **Total time spent on TikTok-related activities per week:**
   - Adding up the time spent on TikTok videos, writing songs, and makeup:
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} + 120 \text{ minutes/week} + 90 \text{ minutes/week} = 282 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

5. **Total time spent on TikTok-related activities in a month (4 weeks):**
   - Since there are 4 weeks in the month, the total time spent is:
     \[
     282 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Converting the total time from minutes to hours:**

     - 4 mirrors
     - 2 shelves
     - 1 chandelier
     - 10 pictures

2. **Additional Cost:**
   - Angela needs 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures.
   - The additional cost is $15.00 per item.

Let's calculate the additional cost for the items Angela needs:

- **Mirrors:**
  - Additional mirrors needed: \( 6 - 4 = 2 \)
  - Additional cost for mirrors: \( 2 \times 15 = 30 \)

- **Chandeliers:**
  - Additional chandeliers needed: \( 2 - 1 = 1 \)
  - Additional cost for chandeliers: \( 1 \times 15 = 15 \)

- **Pictures:**
  - Additional pictures needed: \( 20 - 10 = 10 \)
  - Additional cost for pictures: \( 10 \times 15 = 150 \)

Now, let's sum up the additional costs:

- Total additional cost: \( 30 + 15 + 150 = 195 \)

Finally, we add the base cost to the total additional cost:

- Total cost: \( 129 + 195 = 324 \)

"To determine how much money Roy has saved, we start by finding out how much Anthony has saved. According to the problem, Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00. Therefore, we calculate Anthony's savings as follows:

\[
\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
\]

Next, we need to find out how much Roy has saved. The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find 40% of Anthony's savings, we calculate:

\[
40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30.00 = 12.00
\]

Adding this amount to Anthony's savings gives Roy's total savings:

\[
\text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30.00 + 12.00 = 42.00
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{42.00}

"To determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain, we need to work through the relationships between the heights of mountains each person can lift step by step.

1. **Pompei's mountain height**: Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch high.
2. **Saskay's mountain height**: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei. Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain:
   \[
   12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
3. **Kagiyami's mountain height**: Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay. Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain:
   \[
   4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]
4. **Naruto's mountain height**: Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami. Therefore, Naruto can lift a mountain:
   \[
   10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
   \]

To convert the height from inches to feet, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches:
\[
480 \text{ inches} \div 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 40 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}

"To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we start by calculating the distance for each part of his journey separately.

1. **First Leg:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

2. **Second Leg:**
   - Speed: 8 miles per hour
   - Time: 6 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 8 miles/hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Next, we sum the distances from both legs of the journey to find the total distance traveled.

- Total Distance = Distance of First Leg + Distance of Second Leg
- Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, the total distance Mason has traveled is 80 miles."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance across the highway, given that three kangaroos take 18 hours to do so.

1. **Determine the total distance \( D \) traveled by the kangaroos:**
   - Let the speed of each kangaroo be \( v \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
     \]

2. **Determine the speed of each turtle:**
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle is \( \frac{v}{2} \).

3. **Calculate the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \):**
   - Let \( t \) be the time it takes for four turtles to travel the distance \( D \).
   - The total distance \( D \) can also be expressed in terms of the speed of the turtles and the time \( t \):
     \[
     D = 4 \left( \frac{v}{2} \right) t = 2vt
     \]
   - Since we know \( D = 54v \), we can set the two expressions for \( D \) equal to each other:
     \[
     54v = 2vt
     \]
   - Solving for \( t \):
     \[
     t = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27
     \]

Therefore, it will take four turtles 27 hours to travel across the highway.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of clay dishes each person made:

1. **Kora's Clay Dishes**: Given that Kora made 20 clay dishes.
   \[
   K = 20
   \]

2. **Rory's Clay Dishes**: Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora.
   \[
   R = K + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Jada's Clay Dishes**: Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory.
   \[
   J = 2 \times R = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Total Clay Dishes**: To find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora, we sum their individual counts.
   \[
   \text{Total} = J + R + K = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140
   \]

Therefore, the total number of clay dishes they all make together is:
\[
\boxed{140}

"To determine how much money Erika has in her purse, we start by calculating the reduced price of the laptop after trading in her old one. The original price is $600, and with the trade-in, the price drops by $200, making the new price:

\[ 600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars} \]

Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, which means she currently has:

\[ 400 - 50 = 350 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we account for the money Erika has from her part-time job and her mom's contribution. She received $150 from her job and $80 from her mom, totaling:

\[ 150 + 80 = 230 \text{ dollars} \]

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we subtract the amount she has from her other sources from the total amount she needs:

\[ 350 - 230 = 120 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{120}

"To determine the number of apple slices left, we start by calculating the total number of slices from the apples Adam slices. 

First, we calculate the slices from the large apples:
\[ 3 \text{ large apples} \times 5 \text{ slices per large apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we calculate the slices from the small apples:
\[ 5 \text{ small apples} \times 3 \text{ slices per small apple} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of slices:
\[ 15 \text{ slices from large apples} + 15 \text{ slices from small apples} = 30 \text{ slices} \]

Adam eats 15 slices, so the number of slices left is:
\[ 30 \text{ slices} - 15 \text{ slices} = 15 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of apple slices left is:

"To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to have to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we start by calculating the current milk production with the 3 cows:

\[ 3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow/day} = 15 \text{ liters/day} \]

Next, we find out how much more milk is needed to reach 25 liters:
\[ 25 \text{ liters/day} - 15 \text{ liters/day} = 10 \text{ liters/day} \]

To produce the additional 10 liters of milk a day, we need to determine how many more cows are required:
\[ \frac{10 \text{ liters/day}}{5 \text{ liters/cow/day}} = 2 \text{ cows} \]

Therefore, the farmer needs to have 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the remaining length of each glue stick and then sum these lengths.

1. **First glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \( \frac{1}{6} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{5}{6} \times 12 = 10 \) millimeters

2. **Second glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \) millimeters

3. **Third glue stick:**
   - Original length: 12 millimeters
   - Used portion: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Remaining portion: \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - Remaining length: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) millimeters

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and using the given relationships:

- Let \( S \) represent the number of socks Jack has.
- Let \( D \) represent the number of dishes Jack has.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( D = 60 \) (Jack has 60 dishes).
2. \( D = 2S \) (Jack has twice as many dishes as socks).

Using the second equation with \( D = 60 \):
\[ 60 = 2S \]
Solving for \( S \):
\[ S = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]
So, Jack has 30 socks.

Next, we determine the number of socks and dishes Peter has:
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) socks.
- Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) dishes.

Now, we calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together:
- Jack has \( 30 \) socks and \( 60 \) dishes, totaling \( 30 + 60 = 90 \) items.
- Peter has \( 60 \) socks and \( 30 \) dishes, totaling \( 60 + 30 = 90 \) items.

Therefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is:
\[ 90 + 90 = 180 \]

"To determine how many groups can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time required for each group and then see how many such groups can fit into the total available time.

First, let's calculate the total time required for one group:
- Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
- Time to perform: 6 minutes
- Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

Adding these times together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes per group} \]

Next, we need to account for the intermission:
- Intermission time: 10 minutes

The total time for the concert is 2 hours, which is equivalent to:
\[ 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
\[ 120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} \]

We now need to determine how many groups can fit into the remaining 110 minutes:

"To determine the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years with a simple interest scheme, we start by calculating the simple interest using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

Given:
- Principal (\(P\)) = $300
- Rate (\(R\)) = \(\frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\% = 2.25\) (as a decimal)
- Time (\(T\)) = 3 years

First, we calculate the simple interest:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 \]

Let's compute this:
\[ 300 \times 2.25 = 675 \]
\[ 675 \times 3 = 2025 \]

So, the simple interest earned over 3 years is $2025.

Next, we add the simple interest to the original principal to find the total amount:
\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Simple Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 2025 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 2325 \]

"To determine the total number of homes built over the next three years, we follow these steps:

1. In the first year, the town builds 12 homes.
2. In the second year, the town builds three times the number of homes built in the first year, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) homes.
3. In the third year, the town counts the total number of homes built in the first two years and then doubles this total. The total number of homes built in the first two years is \(12 + 36 = 48\). Therefore, in the third year, the town builds \(2 \times 48 = 96\) homes.

Summing up the homes built over the three years:
\[12 + 36 + 96 = 144\]

3. Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age: \( M = 3B - 1 \).
4. The sum of all ages is 87: \( Y + B + S + M = 87 \).

From the first two equations, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( B \):
\[ S = Y - 2 \]

Substituting \( Y = B - 3 \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[ S = (B - 3) - 2 = B - 5 \]

Now, we substitute \( Y = B - 3 \) and \( S = B - 5 \) into the sum of the ages equation:
\[ (B - 3) + B + (B - 5) + (3B - 1) = 87 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ B - 3 + B + B - 5 + 3B - 1 = 87 \]
\[ 6B - 9 = 87 \]

Add 9 to both sides:
\[ 6B = 96 \]

Divide by 6:
\[ B = 16 \]

Now, we find \( Y \):
\[ Y = B - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

Therefore, you are 13 years old. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{13} \]"
"To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we start by calculating the total number of glue sticks required:

\[ 27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks} \]

Next, we need to find out how many packs of 8 glue sticks are required to meet this demand. We do this by dividing the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

\[ \frac{54}{8} = 6.75 \]

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs and he needs to ensure he has enough glue sticks, he must round up to the next whole number. Therefore, he needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"To find the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount of Water:**
   - On the first day, the amount of water is 4000 gallons.

2. **Amount of Water on the Second Day:**
   - After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles.
   - Therefore, on the second day, the amount of water is \( 4000 \times 2 = 8000 \) gallons.

3. **Amount of Water on the Third Day:**
   - On the third day, the volume of water increases by 6000 gallons.
   - Therefore, on the third day, the amount of water is \( 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \) gallons.

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is 14000 gallons."
"To determine the number of people infected after three days, we can model the exponential growth of infections with discrete time steps. Starting with 10 infected individuals, each day each infected person infects 6 others.

**Day 0 (initial state):**
- Number of infected people: 10

**Day 1:**
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(10 \times 6 = 60\)
- Total number of infected people: \(10 + 60 = 70\)

**Day 2:**
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(70 \times 6 = 420\)
- Total number of infected people: \(70 + 420 = 490\)

**Day 3:**
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
- Number of new infections: \(490 \times 6 = 2940\)
- Total number of infected people: \(490 + 2940 = 3430\)

Thus, the number of people infected after three days is \(\boxed{3430}\)."
"To find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we start by calculating Rafaela's total tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, we calculate:

\[
\text{Rafaela's total tips} = 40 \times 20 = 800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we determine Julieta's total tips. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find 10% of Rafaela's total tips:

\[
10\% \text{ of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting this amount from Rafaela's total tips gives us Julieta's total tips:

\[
\text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 - 80 = 720 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta to find the total amount of tips they received together:

\[
\text{Total tips} = \text{Rafaela's total tips} + \text{Julieta's total tips} = 800 + 720 = 1520 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"Jennifer initially had 12 oranges. She gave 2 oranges to each of her 3 daughters, which totals 6 oranges. Additionally, her only son received 3 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges given away is 6 + 3 = 9 oranges.

To find out how many oranges Jennifer remained with, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the initial number of oranges:

\[12 - 9 = 3\]

Thus, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges."
"To determine how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a year, we start by establishing the number of badges each person earns based on the given information.

1. **Claire's Badges:**
   - Claire earns 1 badge per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, Claire earns \(1 \times 12 = 12\) badges in a year.

2. **Amber's Badges:**
   - It takes Amber twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.
   - Since Claire earns a badge every month, Amber earns a badge every 2 months.
   - Therefore, Amber earns \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) badges in a year.

3. **Wendy's Badges:**
   - Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.
   - Since Claire earns 12 badges in a year, Wendy earns \(3 \times 12 = 36\) badges in a year.

4. **Difference in Badges Earned:**
   - Wendy earns 36 badges in a year.
   - Amber earns 6 badges in a year.
   - The difference in the number of badges earned by Wendy and Amber is \(36 - 6 = 30\).

Thus, Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in a year.

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}

"To find the total number of coins Gretchen has, we start with the information that she has 70 gold coins and 30 fewer silver coins than gold coins. This means the number of silver coins is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of silver coins} = \text{Number of gold coins} - 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of silver coins} = 70 - 30 \]
\[ \text{Number of silver coins} = 40 \]

Next, we add the number of gold coins and silver coins to find the total number of coins:

\[ \text{Total number of coins} = \text{Number of gold coins} + \text{Number of silver coins} \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 70 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Total number of coins} = 110 \]

Therefore, the total number of coins Gretchen has is 110."
"To determine the total number of leftover burritos, we follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of burritos distributed to the students. There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos:
\[ 50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos} \]

2. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos distributed:
\[ 500 \text{ burritos} - 20 \text{ burritos} = 480 \text{ burritos} \]

3. Subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George and the number of burritos distributed to the students from the total number of burritos ordered:
\[ 600 \text{ burritos} - 480 \text{ burritos} = 120 \text{ burritos} \]

Thus, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:
\[ \boxed{120} \]"
"To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we start by identifying the number of each type of car based on the given information.

1. **Red Cars:**
   The rink has 12 red cars.

2. **Green Cars:**
   The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, the number of green cars is:
   \[
   12 - 2 = 10
   \]

3. **Blue Cars:**
   The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as green cars. Therefore, the number of blue cars is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

Next, we sum the number of red, green, and blue cars to find the total number of these three types of cars:
\[
12 \text{ (red)} + 10 \text{ (green)} + 30 \text{ (blue)} = 52
\]

The total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
\[
75 - 52 = 23

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has.
- Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Together, they have 85 books: \( S + A + F = 85 \).
2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne: \( S = A + 25 \).
3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn: \( A = F - 12 \).

We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \) into the first equation. From the third relationship, we have \( A = F - 12 \). Substituting \( A = F - 12 \) into the second relationship gives \( S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 \).

Now, substituting \( S = F + 13 \) and \( A = F - 12 \) into the first equation \( S + A + F = 85 \), we get:
\[
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85
\]
\[
3F + 1 = 85
\]
Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[
3F = 84
\]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[
F = 28
\]

Thus, Fawn has 28 books. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{28}

   - Each kid should have 4 jello cups.
   - Therefore, the total number of jello cups needed is:
     \[
     30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ jello cups per kid} = 120 \text{ jello cups}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of boxes required:**
   - One box of jello makes 10 jello cups.
   - To find out how many boxes are needed for 120 jello cups, we divide the total number of jello cups by the number of jello cups per box:
     \[
     \frac{120 \text{ jello cups}}{10 \text{ jello cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each box of jello costs $1.25.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 12 boxes is:
     \[

"To determine how much Keenan spends per week, we start by calculating Madeline's and Keenan's monthly contributions based on the given percentages and total monthly cost.

Given that Madeline pays 60% of the $400 monthly cost, we calculate her monthly payment as follows:
\[ \text{Madeline's monthly payment} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars} \]

Since the total monthly cost is $400, Keenan's monthly payment is:
\[ \text{Keenan's monthly payment} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. There are 4 weeks in a month, so we divide Keenan's monthly payment by 4:
\[ \text{Keenan's weekly payment} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Keenan spends per week is:

1. **Total pieces of pizza**: 60 pieces.

2. **Pieces eaten on the first day**:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after the first day**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Pieces eaten on the second day**:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the second day} = 10 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Remaining pieces after the second day**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Pieces eaten on the third day**:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

7. **Total pieces eaten so far**:
   \[
   \text{Total pieces eaten} = 24 \text{ (first day)} + 10 \text{ (second day)} + 14 \text{ (third day)} = 48 \text{ pieces}

"To find out how much David will spend on 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water, we start by determining the cost per bottle for each item.

For soda:
- Seven bottles cost $21.00.
- Therefore, the cost per bottle of soda is $21.00 / 7 = $3.00.

For water:
- Four bottles cost $8.00.
- Therefore, the cost per bottle of water is $8.00 / 4 = $2.00.

Next, we calculate the total cost for David's purchase:
- The cost for 3 bottles of soda is 3 * $3.00 = $9.00.
- The cost for 2 bottles of water is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost:
- Total cost = $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

Thus, the final cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is $13.00."

"Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long and sells it for $2 per meter, making a total revenue of $40. She uses this money to buy a new rope that costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of the new rope she can buy, we divide her total money by the cost per meter of the new rope:

\[
\text{Number of meters of new rope} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{1.5 \text{ dollars/meter}} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
\]

Since she can only buy whole meters of the new rope, she can buy 26 meters. The cost for 26 meters of the new rope is:

\[
\text{Cost of 26 meters of new rope} = 26 \text{ meters} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/meter} = 39 \text{ dollars}
\]

Subtracting the cost of the new rope from her total revenue gives:

\[

"To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we will calculate the total cost of all the items she has in her cart and then subtract this total from her budget.

1. **Cost of Bacon:**
   Kelly has 5 packs of bacon, and they cost $10 in total.
   \[
   \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of Chicken:**
   Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, and each packet costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   \[
   \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}

3. **Cost of Strawberries:**
   Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, and each pack costs $4.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Apples:**
   Kelly has 7 packs of apples, and each pack costs half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   \[
   \text{Price of one pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}

"To find the total number of birds Jerry counts, we start by calculating the number of birds flying overhead. Given that there are 6 birds nesting in the bushes and 2/3 of that number are flying overhead, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of birds flying overhead} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4
\]

Next, we calculate the number of birds feeding. Jerry counts 3 groups of 8 birds each feeding:

\[
\text{Number of birds feeding} = 3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Now, we sum up all the birds Jerry counts:

\[
\text{Total number of birds} = 6 + 4 + 24 = 34
\]

Therefore, the total number of birds Jerry counts is:

\[
\boxed{34}

"To determine how many more petals the African daisies have compared to the orchids, we start by calculating the total number of petals for each type of flower.

First, we calculate the total number of petals on the orchids:
\[ 5 \text{ orchids} \times 5 \text{ petals/orchid} = 25 \text{ petals} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of petals on the African daisies:
\[ 4 \text{ daisies} \times 10 \text{ petals/daisy} = 40 \text{ petals} \]

To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of petals on the orchids from the total number of petals on the daisies:
\[ 40 \text{ petals} - 25 \text{ petals} = 15 \text{ petals} \]

Therefore, the African daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids. The final answer is:

"To find the speed of a whirligig, we start by determining the speed of a thingamabob. Given that a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second and it spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob, we can calculate the speed of a thingamabob as follows:

\[ \text{Speed of thingamabob} = \frac{\text{Speed of whatchamacallit}}{11} = \frac{121 \text{ meters/second}}{11} = 11 \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we know that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. Therefore, the speed of a whirligig is:

\[ \text{Speed of whirligig} = 5 \times \text{Speed of thingamabob} = 5 \times 11 \text{ meters/second} = 55 \text{ meters/second} \]

Thus, the speed at which a whirligig spins is 55 meters per second."
"To determine the cost of one carrot, we start with the total daily expenditure and subtract the known costs of the salad and yogurt. Ellen's total daily expenditure is $11, the salad costs $6, and the yogurt costs half the price of the salad, which is $3. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the cost of one carrot, denoted as \( C \):

\[ 2C + 6 + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 2C + 9 = 11 \]

Subtract 9 from both sides:

\[ 2C = 2 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ C = 1 \]

Thus, the cost of one carrot every day is $1. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To determine Mark's weekly earnings after the pay raise, we start by calculating his new hourly wage. Initially, his hourly wage was $10, and it was raised by $2 per hour. Therefore, his new hourly wage is:
\[ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of hours Mark works in a week. He works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so:
\[ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} \]

To find his weekly earnings, we multiply his new hourly wage by the total number of hours he works in a week:
\[ 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week} \]

Thus, Mark makes $480 a week."
"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Tasha made from lemonade sales. We know her total earnings from both lemonade sales and mowing lawns were $80. We also know that she mowed Joe's lawn once and received $6 for that work. Let's denote the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as \( x \). Therefore, she mowed Joe's lawn \( x \) times and received \( 6x \) dollars from mowing lawns.

Given:
- She mowed Kamala's lawn \( 3x \) times.
- She mowed Alba's lawn \( 5x \) times.

The total earnings from mowing lawns is:
\[ 6x \]

Since her total earnings were $80, the amount she made from lemonade sales is:
\[ 80 - 6x \]

To find the specific amount, we need to determine \( x \). However, the problem does not provide the value of \( x \). Assuming \( x = 1 \) (as a common assumption if not specified), we can calculate:
\[ 80 - 6 \times 1 = 80 - 6 = 74 \]

Thus, if \( x = 1 \), the amount Tasha made from lemonade sales is:
\[ \boxed{74} \]

This is the final numerical answer based on the assumption that \( x = 1 \)."
"To find the weight of Harry, we start with Martin's weight and follow the given relationships step by step.

1. Martin's weight is 55 kg.
2. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight:
   \[ \text{Carl's weight} = 55 \, \text{kg} + 16 \, \text{kg} = 71 \, \text{kg} \]
3. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight:
   \[ \text{Christian's weight} = 71 \, \text{kg} + 8 \, \text{kg} = 79 \, \text{kg} \]
4. Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight:
   \[ \text{Harry's weight} = 79 \, \text{kg} - 5 \, \text{kg} = 74 \, \text{kg} \]

Therefore, the weight of Harry is 74 kg."
"To determine John's profit from renting his car, we start by calculating the total number of hours he rents his car in a month:

\[ 10 \text{ times/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/time} = 30 \text{ hours/month} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from renting the car:

\[ 30 \text{ hours/month} \times \$25/\text{hour} = \$750/\text{month} \]

Finally, we find the profit by subtracting the monthly car payment from the total earnings:

\[ \$750/\text{month} - \$500/\text{month} = \$250/\text{month} \]

Thus, John's profit from renting his car is:

\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of notebooks Martha originally had as \( M \).

Given that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha, we can express the number of notebooks Joseph had as \( 3M \).

Martha then bought 5 more notebooks, bringing her total to 7 notebooks. This can be represented by the equation:
\[ M + 5 = 7 \]

Solving for \( M \):
\[ M = 7 - 5 \]
\[ M = 2 \]

So, Martha originally had 2 notebooks. Consequently, Joseph had:
\[ 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ notebooks} \]

Now, Martha has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we calculate:
\[ 7 - 6 = 1 \]

Therefore, Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.

The final numerical answer is:

"To find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday, we start by calculating the distance Anis rowed. Given that Anis rowed \(\frac{1}{5}\) times more miles than Dijana, and Dijana rowed 50 miles, we can calculate Anis' distance as follows:

\[
\text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we add the distances rowed by Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day is \(\boxed{110}\) miles."

1. **Pages read by Denise and Daniel yesterday:**
   - Denise read 10 pages.
   - Daniel read 13 pages.

2. **Pages read by Denise today:**
   - Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday.
   - Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.
   - Therefore, Denise read \(13 + 5 = 18\) pages today.

3. **Pages read by Daniel today:**
   - Daniel was not able to read any pages today.
   - Therefore, Daniel read 0 pages today.

4. **Total pages read by Denise:**
   - Yesterday: 10 pages
   - Today: 18 pages
   - Total pages read by Denise: \(10 + 18 = 28\) pages.

5. **Total pages read by Daniel:**
   - Yesterday: 13 pages
   - Today: 0 pages
   - Total pages read by Daniel: \(13 + 0 = 13\) pages.

6. **Difference in the number of pages read by Denise and Daniel:**

"To determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount of soup in terms of adult bowls:**
   - Calvin can fill 4 adult bowls with the soup.
   - Therefore, the total amount of soup is equivalent to 4 adult bowls.

2. **Calculate the total number of bowls needed for the family:**
   - Calvin (1 adult) + Calvin's wife (1 adult) + 2 children (2 children) = 4 bowls in total.

3. **Determine the number of bowls that can be served from the 4 adult bowls:**
   - Since the soup can fill 4 adult bowls, and there are 4 bowls needed in total, all 4 bowls can be served.

4. **Calculate the number of bowls left after serving the family:**
   - Since 4 bowls are needed and 4 bowls are available, there are no bowls left over.

5. **Determine how many times each child can have a bowl of soup:**
   - There are 2 children, and since there are no bowls left over, each child can have a bowl of soup only once.

Thus, each child can have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup **0 times**.

"To determine the amount of material Jo needs to make 20 small and 8 large masks, we can set up a system of equations based on the given information.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the amount of material needed for one small mask.
- Let \( y \) be the amount of material needed for one large mask.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. Therefore, the material needed for one small mask is:
   \[
   x = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per mask}
   \]

2. Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. Therefore, the material needed for one large mask is:
   \[
   y = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per mask}
   \]

Next, we calculate the total material needed for 20 small masks and 8 large masks:
- Material needed for 20 small masks:
  \[
  20 \times 0.5 \text{ yards} = 10 \text{ yards}
  \]

- Material needed for 8 large masks:
  \[
  8 \times 0.75 \text{ yards} = 6 \text{ yards}
  \]

Finally, we sum the material needed for both types of masks to find the total material required:

"To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we start by adding up the time he spends on various activities:

- Harold sleeps for 10 hours.
- He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, which is \(10 - 2 = 8\) hours.
- He walks his dog for 1 hour each day.

Now, we sum these times:
\[ 10 \text{ hours (sleeping)} + 8 \text{ hours (working)} + 1 \text{ hour (walking the dog)} = 19 \text{ hours} \]

Since there are 24 hours in a day, we subtract the total time spent on activities from the total hours in a day to find the free time:
\[ 24 \text{ hours} - 19 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the amount of free time Harold has left in his day is:

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationship described in the question using a system of linear equations. Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age and \( A \) represent Adam's current age.

Given:
- Duncan's current age \( D = 60 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \( D - 8 \).
- Four years ago, Adam's age was \( A - 4 \).
- Eight years ago, Duncan's age was two times Adam's age four years ago.

We can write the equation based on the given information:
\[ D - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]

Substituting \( D = 60 \) into the equation:
\[ 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 52 = 2(A - 4) \]
\[ 26 = A - 4 \]
\[ A = 30 \]

So, Adam's current age is 30. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
\[ A + 8 = 30 + 8 = 38 \]

Therefore, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.

"To determine how much Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them, we need to calculate the total amount spent and then divide by 2.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items they bought:
1. The cake costs $11.
2. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons. The price is $0.5 for 2 balloons, so the cost per balloon is $0.5 / 2 = $0.25. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is 12 * $0.25 = $3.
3. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7, so the total cost for the ice cream is 2 * $7 = $14.

Now, let's sum up the total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$11 + \$3 + \$14 = \$28 \]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to buy these items, the total amount of money they had together is $28. Since they split the money equally, each of them received:
\[ \text{Amount each received} = \frac{\$28}{2} = \$14 \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.

"To calculate the profit from selling the lollipops, we start by determining the total revenue from the sales. Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops, so the total number of lollipops sold is:

\[ 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \]

Each lollypop was sold for $0.8, so the total revenue is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.8/\text{lollypop} = \$240 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops. Each lollypop was bought for $0.5, so the total cost is:

\[ 300 \text{ lollipops} \times \$0.5/\text{lollypop} = \$150 \]

The profit is then the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[ \$240 - \$150 = \$90 \]

Therefore, the class was able to raise \(\boxed{90}\) dollars from the profit of selling lollipops."

These 12 cups are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea. Therefore, the number of cups of chamomile tea and mint tea is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \]
So, she brews 6 cups of chamomile tea and 6 cups of mint tea in total.

Next, we need to determine how many cups of chamomile and mint tea are in each row. Since she divides the 27 cups into 3 rows, the number of cups in each row is:
\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \]
Since the cups in each row are divided equally between chamomile and mint tea, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \]

Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[ \boxed{4.5} \]"
"To determine the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we start by calculating the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Given that each trip takes 4 hours, the number of trips in 8 hours is:

\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

Next, we know the sloth needs to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. Since he makes 2 trips in this time, the number of berries he picks up per trip is:

\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we start by calculating the initial amount of water in the tank. Since the tank is filled with half the amount of water in the pool, and the pool contains 10000 gallons, the tank will have:

\[ \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{10000}{2} = 5000 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, we need to find out how much water is removed from the tank over 6 days. Given that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day, the total amount of water removed in 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water removed in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days is:

\[ \text{Water remaining} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ 2000 \]"
"To determine how many more movies Colby can see, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on popcorn and candy:**
   - Colby spent $8 per tub of popcorn and had 2 tubs, so the total spent on popcorn is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
   - Colby spent $2 per box of candy and had 4 boxes, so the total spent on candy is \(4 \times 2 = 8\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total amount spent on popcorn and candy is \(16 + 8 = 24\) dollars.

2. **Determine the remaining budget:**
   - Colby's monthly budget is $150.
   - After spending $24 on popcorn and candy, the remaining budget is \(150 - 24 = 126\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the number of additional movies Colby can see:**
   - Since it is the last day of the month and it is a Friday, Colby can only see one more movie on a Friday or Saturday.
   - The cost of a movie ticket on a Friday or Saturday is $10.
   - With $126 remaining, the number of additional movies he can see is \(\frac{126}{10} = 12.6\).

Since Colby can only see whole movies, he can see 12 more movies.

Thus, the final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the total calories from the mini pastries, we start by calculating the calories in each mini pastry type.

A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, and a mini cinnamon roll has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of that:
\[
\text{Calories in a mini cinnamon roll} = \frac{600}{3} = 200 \text{ calories}
\]

Similarly, a normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, and a mini blueberry muffin has \(\frac{1}{3}\) of that:
\[
\text{Calories in a mini blueberry muffin} = \frac{450}{3} = 150 \text{ calories}
\]

Next, we calculate the total calories from the mini cinnamon rolls:
\[
\text{Total calories from mini cinnamon rolls} = 200 \text{ mini cinnamon rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories per mini cinnamon roll} = 40000 \text{ calories}
\]

Then, we calculate the total calories from the mini blueberry muffins:
\[
\text{Total calories from mini blueberry muffins} = 300 \text{ mini blueberry muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories per mini blueberry muffin} = 45000 \text{ calories}
\]

Finally, we add the total calories from both types of pastries to find the overall total calories:
\[
\text{Total calories} = 40000 \text{ calories} + 45000 \text{ calories} = 85000 \text{ calories}
\]

Thus, the total number of calories in the pastries Andrew baked is:
\[
\boxed{85000}
\]"
"To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:

- Monday: 39 Junebugs
- Tuesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Wednesday: \(2 \times 39 = 78\) Junebugs
- Thursday: 48 Junebugs
- Friday: 57 Junebugs

Adding these together:
\[
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 299
\]

Next, we calculate the average by dividing the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:
\[
\frac{299}{5} = 59.8
\]

Therefore, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{59.8}\)."
"To determine how much farther the bus traveled compared to the car, we start by calculating the distance each vehicle traveled.

For the bus:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 300 \text{ miles} \]

For the car:
\[ \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 240 \text{ miles} \]

To find out how much farther the bus traveled:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 \text{ miles} - 240 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles} \]

Therefore, the bus traveled 60 miles farther than the car. The final answer is:

\[ 60 \]"
"To find out how many bouncy balls Sophie bought, we start by calculating the total number of toys she had before purchasing the bouncy balls. She had 31 building blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 stacking rings. Adding these together gives:

\[ 31 + 8 + 9 = 48 \]

Sophie now has a total of 62 toys. To determine how many bouncy balls were in the tube, we subtract the number of toys she had before from the total number of toys she has now:

\[ 62 - 48 = 14 \]

Therefore, the number of bouncy balls that came in the tube is 14."
"To solve the problem, we start with the given information and set up a system of equations based on the relationships provided:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old:
   \[
   P + Pa + J = 100
   \]
2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   Pa = J + 10
   \]
3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = Pa + J
   \]

Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now, substituting \( P \) and \( Pa \) in terms of \( J \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplifying the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now, we can find \( Pa \) and \( P \):
\[
Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50
\]

Thus, the age of Peter is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]"
"Initially, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, which totals to \(4 \times 2 = 8\) balloons. Including Maria's 1 balloon, the total number of balloons at the start is \(8 + 1 = 9\).

Her mom then gave each person 3 more balloons. Since there are 5 people (Maria and her 4 friends), the total number of additional balloons is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

Adding the initial total to the additional balloons, the total number of water balloons is \(9 + 15 = 24\).

Therefore, the total number of water balloons the girls had is \(\boxed{24}\)."
"To determine the number of new tables needed, we start by calculating the total number of boxes of stuff available for the yard sale. 

1. Each of the 10 people donates 5 boxes of stuff:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. They also have 10 boxes of stuff already:
   \[
   10 \text{ boxes}
   \]

3. Adding these together gives the total number of boxes:
   \[
   50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how many tables are required to fit all the boxes. Each table can hold 2 boxes of stuff.

4. Calculate the number of tables needed:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ boxes}}{2 \text{ boxes/table}} = 30 \text{ tables}
   \]

They already own 15 tables.

5. Calculate the number of new tables needed:
   \[
   30 \text{ tables} - 15 \text{ tables} = 15 \text{ new tables}
   \]

Therefore, the number of new tables needed is \(\boxed{15}\)."

"To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total widget production and revenue for each machine over a month.

First, let's calculate the daily widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(60 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1440 \text{ widgets/day}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(45 \text{ widgets/hour} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 1080 \text{ widgets/day}\)

Next, let's calculate the monthly widget production for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(1440 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 43200 \text{ widgets/month}\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(1080 \text{ widgets/day} \times 30 \text{ days/month} = 32400 \text{ widgets/month}\)

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling the widgets for each machine:
- Widgeteer 3000: \(43200 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$259200\)
- WidgetMaster 9000: \(32400 \text{ widgets} \times \$6/\text{widget} = \$194400\)

Finally, let's find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000:
\[
\$259200 - \$194400 = \$64800

"To determine how much Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of his stay under both the 24-hour option and the 12-hour plus additional hours option, and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 24-hour option:
- The 24-hour stay costs 1600 pesos.

Next, let's calculate the cost if Cameron chooses the 12-hour plus additional hours option:
- Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours.
- The first 12 hours cost 1000 pesos.
- The remaining 5 hours cost 5 * 70 pesos = 350 pesos.
- Therefore, the total cost for the 12-hour plus additional hours option is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.

Now, we find the difference between the two options to determine how much Cameron would save:
- The savings would be the cost of the 24-hour option minus the cost of the 12-hour plus additional hours option.
- Savings = 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the total amount of hay Nate needs, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps.

First, we calculate the amount of hay each sheep needs. Each goat requires 5 pounds of hay, and each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs. Therefore, the amount of hay each sheep needs is:

\[
\text{Hay per sheep} = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the goats. There are 15 goats, and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for goats} = 15 \times 5 = 75 \text{ pounds}
\]

Then, we calculate the total amount of hay needed for the sheep. There are 12 sheep, and each sheep needs 7 pounds of hay:

\[
\text{Total hay for sheep} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ pounds}
\]

Finally, we add the total hay needed for the goats and the sheep to find the total amount of hay Nate needs:

\[
\text{Total hay needed} = 75 + 84 = 159 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the total amount of hay Nate needs is \(\boxed{159}\) pounds."
"John earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours in the week. His total earnings are calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \]

After spending 50 dollars on gas, his remaining money is:

\[ \text{Remaining after gas} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 250 \, \text{dollars} \]

John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so the remaining money after the deposit is:

\[ \text{Remaining after deposit} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars} \]

He then spends 50 dollars on 5 pencils, each costing 10 dollars:

\[ \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars} \]

Subtracting the cost of the pencils from the remaining money gives:

\[ \text{Remaining after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars} \]

Finally, to find out how many 25 dollar pens he can buy with the remaining 100 dollars:

\[ \text{Number of pens} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens} \]

Therefore, the number of 25 dollar pens John can buy is:

\[ 4 \]"

Therefore, the total number of children in the drill is 280."
"To determine how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has left for herself, we start by calculating the total number of bottles she can redeem with her 9 coupons. Each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles, so:

\[
9 \text{ coupons} \times 100 \text{ bottles per coupon} = 900 \text{ bottles}
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of bottles given to the students. There are 29 pupils, and each student receives 2 bottles:

\[
29 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ bottles per student} = 58 \text{ bottles}
\]

To find out how many bottles the teacher has left for herself, we subtract the number of bottles given to the students from the total number of bottles she has:

\[

"To determine the total time James took to swim across the lake, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 12 miles} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time James rests:**
   James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Rest time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to be swum:**
   The total distance is 20 miles, and James has already swum 12 miles.
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   James swims at half the initial speed after resting.
   \[
   \text{Speed for remaining distance} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   \[
   \text{Time to swim 8 miles} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time to swim 12 miles} + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time to swim remaining 8 miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}

"To calculate the total commission Cayley will earn, we'll break down the calculation into two parts: the commission from the New York Times and the commission from the Wall Street Journal.

First, let's calculate the commission from the New York Times:
- Each New York Times costs $5.
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each New York Times.
- Commission per New York Times = 10% of $5 = 0.10 * $5 = $0.50.
- He sells 6 copies of the New York Times.
- Total commission from New York Times = 6 * $0.50 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:
- Each Wall Street Journal costs $15.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each Wall Street Journal.
- Commission per Wall Street Journal = 8% of $15 = 0.08 * $15 = $1.20.
- He sells 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.
- Total commission from Wall Street Journal = 10 * $1.20 = $12.

Finally, we sum up the commissions from both newspapers:
- Total commission = Commission from New York Times + Commission from Wall Street Journal = $3 + $12 = $15.

Therefore, the total commission Cayley will earn is $15."
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( L \) represent Leo's age.
- Marcus's age is half of Leo's age, so Marcus is \( \frac{L}{2} \) years old.
- Marcus is also five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26 years old.

From the information given:
\[ \frac{L}{2} = 26 - 5 \]

Solving for \( L \):
\[ \frac{L}{2} = 21 \]
\[ L = 21 \times 2 \]
\[ L = 42 \]

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old. The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( A \) represent the points scored by Azibo.
- Let \( B \) represent the points scored by Bahati.
- Let \( D \) represent the points scored by Dinar.

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:
1. Bahati scored the most points and it was 20 more than Azibo scored: \( B = A + 20 \).
2. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar scored: \( B = D + 10 \).
3. The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45: \( B + A + D = 45 \).

We can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the first two equations into the third equation. From the first equation, we have \( B = A + 20 \). From the second equation, we have \( B = D + 10 \). Since both expressions equal \( B \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ A + 20 = D + 10 \]
Solving for \( D \) in terms of \( A \):
\[ D = A + 10 \]

Now, substitute \( B = A + 20 \) and \( D = A + 10 \) into the total points equation:
\[ (A + 20) + A + (A + 10) = 45 \]
Combine like terms:
\[ 3A + 30 = 45 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 3A = 15 \]
Divide by 3:
\[ A = 5 \]

Thus, Azibo scored 5 points. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"

"Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, he worked for a total of 16 hours. Converting this time into minutes gives us 960 minutes. Since he staples 30 reports every 15 minutes, we can determine the total number of reports he stapled by calculating how many 15-minute intervals fit into 960 minutes. This is given by 960 minutes divided by 15 minutes per interval, which equals 64 intervals. Multiplying this by the number of reports he staples per interval (30 reports) gives us the total number of reports stapled: 64 intervals * 30 reports/interval = 1920 reports.

Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled is 1920."
"To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to account for her total sleep duration, the time she spent sleepwalking, and the time she woke up early.

1. **Calculate the usual sleep duration:**
   - Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which totals 8 hours.
   - Converting hours to minutes: \( 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \).

2. **Calculate the time spent sleepwalking:**
   - Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - The duration of sleepwalking is \( 2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes} \).

3. **Calculate the time she woke up early:**
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual at 5:55 a.m.
   - The usual wake-up time is 6 a.m., so she woke up at 5:55 a.m.

4. **Calculate the total time she was awake:**
   - From 10 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is \( 7 \text{ hours and } 55 \text{ minutes} \).
   - Converting this to minutes: \( 7 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 420 \text{ minutes} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 475 \text{ minutes} \).

5. **Calculate the total time spent sleepwalking and waking up early:**
   - Total time awake: 475 minutes
   - Time sleepwalking: 23 minutes
   - Time waking up early: 5 minutes
   - Total time not sleeping: \( 23 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes} \).

6. **Calculate the actual sleep time:**
   - Total sleep time: 480 minutes
   - Time not sleeping: 28 minutes
   - Actual sleep time: \( 480 \text{ minutes} - 28 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes} \).

Thus, the number of minutes Kim slept on her bed that day is \(\boxed{452}\)."
"Jonathan initially has 24 measuring cups. Given that he has \(\frac{2}{3}\) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, the number of measuring spoons he has is:

\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \]

After giving 6 measuring spoons to Pedro, the number of measuring spoons he has left is:

\[ 16 - 6 = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:

\[ 24 + 10 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is \(\boxed{34}\)."
"To determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we start by calculating the initial number of occupied beds. Given that the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of these beds are occupied:

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the number of unoccupied beds initially:

\[
\text{Initial unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800
\]

With 50 patients being admitted each day, over 2 weeks (which is 14 days), the total number of patients admitted is:

\[
\text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \times 14 = 700
\]

Adding these admitted patients to the initial number of occupied beds gives us the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900
\]

Finally, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds after 2 weeks} = 1000 - 900 = 100
\]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]"
"Robyn sends sixteen emails a day. Out of these, 7 are work emails, leaving 9 emails that are not work emails.

Two-thirds of these 9 emails are sent to her family. Therefore, the number of emails sent to her family is:
\[ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \]

After sending emails to her family, the remaining emails are:
\[ 9 - 6 = 3 \]

One-third of these remaining 3 emails are sent to her boyfriend. Therefore, the number of emails sent to her boyfriend is:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \]

Thus, Robyn sends \(\boxed{1}\) email to her boyfriend each day."
"To determine Shawna's father's age, we start by finding Shawna's age. Given that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we calculate Shawna's age as follows:

\[ \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old} \]

Next, we calculate Shawna's father's age, knowing that he is five times as old as Shawna:

\[ \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old} \]

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 45 \]"
"To find the actual number of people who attended the concert, given that Courtney's reported number of 48 is 20% more than the actual number, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 48 = x + 0.20x \]
\[ 48 = 1.20x \]

To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.20:
\[ x = \frac{48}{1.20} \]
\[ x = 40 \]

Therefore, the actual number of people who attended the concert is:
\[ \boxed{40} \]"
"Let's denote the number of balls Jeffrey carried as \( J \). According to the problem, Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey, so Jason carried \( 2J \) balls. Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried \( 4J \) balls.

We are given that Jason carried 2 balls. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ 2J = 2 \]

Solving for \( J \):
\[ J = 1 \]

Now we can determine the number of balls each boy carried:
- Jeffrey carried \( J = 1 \) ball.
- Jason carried \( 2J = 2 \) balls.
- Jordan carried \( 4J = 4 \times 1 = 4 \) balls.

The total number of balls carried by the three boys is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \]

Therefore, the total number of balls that the coach brought to practice is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]"
"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

1. **First Day**: The pirates dug 10 holes.
2. **Second Day**: The pirates dug 13 holes.
3. **Third Day**: The pirates dug 8 holes but also filled in 2 holes, so the net increase in holes is \(8 - 2 = 6\) holes.

By the end of the third day, the total number of holes dug is:
\[ 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \]

4. **Fourth Day**: The island had four times as many holes by then as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the first day, there were 10 holes. Therefore, by the end of the third day, the number of holes is:
\[ 4 \times 10 = 40 \]

Since there were 29 holes by the end of the third day, the number of holes dug on the fourth day is:
\[ 40 - 29 = 11 \]

Thus, the number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[ \boxed{11} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and understanding the relationships given in the question. Let's denote the number of corn chips Collins received as \( C \).

Given:
- Amora received 70 corn chips.
- Lainey received 70 corn chips.
- Collins received 15 more corn chips than either Amora or Lainey.

From this, we can express the number of corn chips Collins received as:
\[ C = 70 + 15 = 85 \]

Next, we need to find the total number of corn chips. We sum the number of corn chips each person received:
\[ \text{Total corn chips} = 70 + 70 + 85 \]

Calculating the total:
\[ 70 + 70 = 140 \]
\[ 140 + 85 = 225 \]

Therefore, the total number of corn chips is:
\[ \boxed{225} \]"
"To find the cost of the travel tickets, which is 50% more than the supplies, we start with the cost of the supplies, which is $400. 

First, calculate 50% of $400:
\[ 50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200 \]

Next, add this amount to the cost of the supplies to get the total travel cost:
\[ 400 + 200 = 600 \]

Therefore, the total cost of the travel is $600.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 600 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the given information:

1. \( X = S + 5 \)
2. \( S = 4A - 13 \)
3. \( X + S + A = 339 \)

Substituting \( X = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4A - 13 \) into the third equation:

\[
(S + 5) + S + A = 339
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
2S + A + 5 = 339
\]

Subtract 5 from both sides:

\[
2S + A = 334
\]

Next, substitute \( S = 4A - 13 \) into \( 2S + A = 334 \):

\[
2(4A - 13) + A = 334
\]

Distribute the 2:

\[
8A - 26 + A = 334
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
9A - 26 = 334
\]

Add 26 to both sides:

\[
9A = 360
\]

Divide by 9:

\[
A = 40
\]

Now, find \( S \) using \( S = 4A - 13 \):

\[
S = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, find \( X \) using \( X = S + 5 \):

\[
X = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Verify the total:

\[
X + S + A = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is \( 147 \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{147} \)."
"Given that each episode is 20 minutes long and there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, we can start by determining the number of episodes. Since the number of episodes \( E \) is half the number of minutes per episode \( M \), and \( M = 20 \) minutes, we have:

\[ E = \frac{M}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are 10 episodes. To find the total time John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the duration of each episode:

\[ \text{Total time} = E \times M = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is 200 minutes."
"To determine the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of her journey and then sum these distances.

1. **First Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles.

2. **Second Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles.

3. **Third Segment:**
   - The bird flies for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles.

Now, we sum the distances of all three segments to find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes:
\[ 300 \text{ miles} + 36 \text{ miles} + 110 \text{ miles} = 446 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:
\[ \boxed{446} \]"
"To determine the number of brownies Greta had left over, we start by calculating the total number of brownies she received:

1. Greta made a batch for herself: 1 dozen brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. At her office, she received half a dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. At her friends' surprise party, she received 4 dozen brownies.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Summing these up gives the total number of brownies:
\[
12 \text{ (initial batch)} + 6 \text{ (from office)} + 48 \text{ (from friends)} = 66 \text{ brownies}
\]

Next, we account for the brownies eaten during the party:
\[
1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \text{ dozen} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
\]

Subtracting the eaten brownies from the total gives:
\[
66 \text{ (total brownies)} - 18 \text{ (eaten brownies)} = 48 \text{ brownies}
\]

Therefore, the number of individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]"
"Certainly! Let's break down the ages again for clarity:

- Nani is 8 years old.
- His brother is twice Nani's age, so the brother is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
- Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 75% of Nani's age. So, the sister is \(0.75 \times 8 = 6\) years old.

Now, to find the total age of all three family members, we add their ages together:
\[ 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total age of Nani, his brother, and his sister is 30 years."
"To determine the total time Andy will take to string all the racquets, we need to calculate the time required for each type of racquet and then sum these times, taking into account the different types and their respective stringing times.

1. **Synthetic Gut Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 3
   - Time per racquet: 15 minutes
   - Total time for synthetic gut: \( 3 \times 15 = 45 \) minutes

2. **Polyester String Racquets:**
   - Number of racquets: 5
   - Time per racquet: 22 minutes
   - Total time for polyester string: \( 5 \times 22 = 110 \) minutes

3. **Hybrid Sets:**
   - Number of racquets: 4
   - Time per racquet: 18 minutes
   - Total time for hybrid sets: \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \) minutes

Now, we sum the times for all the racquets:
\[ 45 \text{ minutes} + 110 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 227 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it will take Andy to string all the racquets is:
\[ \boxed{227} \]"
"To find the total cost of the phones John buys, we start by noting the pricing structure: the first two phones are at full price, and each subsequent phone is half price. The price of each phone is $600.

1. **First Phone:**
   - Price: $600

2. **Second Phone:**
   - Price: $600

3. **Third Phone:**
   - Price: $600 / 2 = $300

4. **Fourth Phone:**
   - Price: $600 / 2 = $300

Now, we sum up the prices of all four phones:

"To find the total number of players in both teams combined, we start with the number of players on Carlton's team, which is 13. Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's team, so we add 7 to 13 to find the number of players on Zeke's team:

\[ 13 + 7 = 20 \]

Now, to find the total number of players in both teams, we add the number of players on Zeke's team to the number of players on Carlton's team:

\[ 13 + 20 = 33 \]

Therefore, the total number of players in both teams combined is 33."
"To determine the total number of wooden slats Robert will need, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given the dimensions of the fence are 15 feet in length and 10 feet in width, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet} \]

Since Robert needs 2 wooden slats for every foot of fencing, the total number of wooden slats required is:

\[ \text{Total slats} = 2 \times \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \]

Therefore, the total number of wooden slats Robert will need is:

\[ \boxed{100} \]"
"Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which totals to 4 boxes given away. Therefore, the number of boxes she kept is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 4 \text{ boxes} = 8 \text{ boxes} \]

She kept \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the oranges, so the number of boxes she kept is:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 \text{ boxes} = 3 \text{ boxes} \]

This means the number of boxes she sold is:

\[ 12 \text{ boxes} - 3 \text{ boxes} = 9 \text{ boxes} \]

Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she sold is:

\[ 9 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 180 \text{ oranges} \]

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is \(\boxed{180}\)."
"To solve the problem, let's denote the number of states in the USA as \( S \).

According to the problem, the number of states in India is 4 more than half the number of states in the USA. Therefore, the number of states in India can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]

The total number of states in both countries together is the sum of the states in the USA and the states in India:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \left( \frac{S}{2} + 4 \right) \]

Combine the terms:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = S + \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{2S}{2} + \frac{S}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3S}{2} + 4 \]

Without a specific value for \( S \), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, if we assume the USA has 50 states, we can substitute \( S = 50 \) to find the numerical answer:
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{3 \times 50}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = \frac{150}{2} + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 75 + 4 \]
\[ \text{Total number of states} = 79 \]

Therefore, the total number of states in both countries together, assuming the USA has 50 states, is:
\[ \boxed{79} \]"
"To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford his books, we first calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy:

- Dictionary: $18
- Dinosaur book: $13
- Children's cookbook: $8

Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Tyler has already saved $14. Therefore, the additional amount he needs to earn is:

Additional amount needed = Total cost - Amount saved
Additional amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we divide the additional amount needed by his hourly wage:

Hours needed = Additional amount needed / Hourly wage
Hours needed = $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Thus, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books."
"To solve the problem using a system of equations, let's define the variables first:

- Let \( R \) represent the number of cherries Richard has.
- Let \( J \) represent the number of cherries Jerry has.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of cherries Robert has.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total number of cherries is 60.
2. Robert has 30 cherries.
3. Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard.

We can translate this information into the following equations:
1. \( R + J + B = 60 \)
2. \( B = 30 \)
3. \( B = R + 10 \)

First, substitute \( B = 30 \) into the first equation:
\[ R + J + 30 = 60 \]
\[ R + J = 30 \]

Next, substitute \( B = R + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[ R + J + (R + 10) = 60 \]
\[ 2R + J + 10 = 60 \]
\[ 2R + J = 50 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( R + J = 30 \)
2. \( 2R + J = 50 \)

To solve for \( R \) and \( J \), subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (2R + J) - (R + J) = 50 - 30 \]
\[ R = 20 \]

Substitute \( R = 20 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 20 + J = 30 \]
\[ J = 10 \]

Now, we know:
- Richard has 20 cherries.
- Jerry has 10 cherries.
- Robert has 30 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry:
\[ 30 - 10 = 20 \]

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To determine Sunny's total earnings over the two days, we will calculate the number of boxes sold and then the total revenue from each type of baked good.

**Saturday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 10 - 4 = 6 boxes

**Sunday:**
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

**Total boxes sold:**
- Gingerbread: 10 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 25 boxes
- Apple pie: 6 (Saturday) + 15 (Sunday) = 21 boxes

**Earnings calculation:**
- Price per box of gingerbread: $6
- Price per box of apple pie: $15

**Total earnings:**
- Earnings from gingerbread: 25 boxes * $6 = $150
- Earnings from apple pie: 21 boxes * $15 = $315

**Total earnings over two days:**
- Total earnings: $150 + $315 = $465

Therefore, the total amount Sunny earned for the two days is **$465**."
"To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside over 8 days.
2. Determine the total amount of sunscreen she will need.
3. Calculate how many 8-ounce bottles are required to cover the total amount of sunscreen needed.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Pamela will be outside.**

Pamela spends 4 hours outside each day for 8 days:
\[ 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount of sunscreen she will need.**

Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen per hour. Therefore, for 32 hours:
\[ 32 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 32 \text{ ounces} \]

**Step 3: Calculate how many 8-ounce bottles are required.**

Each bottle contains 8 ounces of sunscreen. To find out how many bottles are needed for 32 ounces:
\[ \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles} \]

Therefore, Pamela needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.

The final numerical answer is:

"The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, which means it costs 60% of the price of the blue car. Given that the blue car costs $100, we calculate the red car's price as follows:

\[ \text{Price of the red car} = 60\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.60 \times 100 = \$60 \]

To find the total cost of both cars, we add the price of the red car to the price of the blue car:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$100 + \$60 = \$160 \]

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is \$160."
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the information provided:

1. Emil's current age \( E = 19 \).
2. When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice the age of his brother.

First, determine the number of years from now when Emil will be 24:
\[ 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years} \]

In 5 years, Emil's age will be 24, his dad's age will be \( D + 5 \), and his brother's age will be \( B + 5 \).

From the problem, when Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
\[ 24 = \frac{1}{2} (D + 5) \]
Multiplying both sides by 2:
\[ 48 = D + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ D = 43 \]

Next, we know that when Emil is 24, he will be twice the age of his brother:
\[ 24 = 2 (B + 5) \]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ 12 = B + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ B = 7 \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the current ages of Emil's dad and his brother:
\[ D + B = 43 + 7 = 50 \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother now is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To find the total number of beads Adrianne has, we add the beads given by each person:

- Her mother gave her 20 beads.
- Her sister gave her 10 more beads than her mother, which is \(20 + 10 = 30\) beads.
- Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) beads.

Adding these together:

\[
20 + 30 + 40 = 90
\]

Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has is \(\boxed{90}\)."
"To find out how many servings of crawfish Joe has, we start by calculating the total amount of crawfish he caught over the three days. 

On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds. On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) pounds. On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is \(\frac{12}{2} = 6\) pounds.

Adding these amounts together gives the total amount of crawfish:
\[3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}\]

Since each serving is 3 pounds, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving to find the number of servings:
\[ \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}\]

Therefore, the number of servings Joe has is \(\boxed{7}\)."
"In Mr. Roper's class of 30 students, 20% are football players. This means:

\[ 20\% \times 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students are football players.} \]

After accounting for the football players, the remaining students are:

\[ 30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students.} \]

Out of these 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of the band:

\[ 25\% \times 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students.} \]

Therefore, the total number of students who need to leave early is:

\[ 6 \text{ (football players)} + 6 \text{ (cheerleaders or band members)} = 12 \text{ students.} \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie, we start by determining the size of Charlie's boots. Given that Sophie's boots are size 5 and Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's, we calculate:

\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

So, Charlie's boots are size 25.

Next, we calculate the average size of the shoes. The total size of the boots is:

\[ 5 + 25 = 30 \]

The average size is:

\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \]

Therefore, the average size of the shoes worn by Charlie and Sophie is 15."
"To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of flowers needed:**
   - Each flower occupies 1 foot of space.
   - There is 1.5 feet of space required between each pair of flowers.
   - The total length of the flower bed is 111 feet.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of flowers needed. The total space occupied by the flowers and the spaces between them can be expressed as:
     \[ n \text{ flowers} \times 1 \text{ foot/flower} + (n-1) \text{ spaces} \times 1.5 \text{ feet/space} = 111 \text{ feet} \]
   - Simplifying the equation:
     \[ n + 1.5(n-1) = 111 \]
     \[ n + 1.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
     \[ 2.5n - 1.5 = 111 \]
     \[ 2.5n = 112.5 \]
     \[ n = \frac{112.5}{2.5} \]
     \[ n = 45 \]
   - Pat needs 45 flowers in total.

2. **Calculate the number of additional flowers Pat needs to buy:**
   - Pat already owns 17 flowers.
   - Therefore, the number of additional flowers needed is:
     \[ 45 - 17 = 28 \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each flower costs $6.
   - The total cost for 28 additional flowers is:
     \[ 28 \times 6 = 168 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Pat will spend at the store is **$168**."
"To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we start by calculating the daily consumption of Edgar's brother. Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we perform the following calculation:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's daily pretzel consumption} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ pretzels} \]

Next, to find the weekly consumption, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week:

\[ \text{Edgar's brother's weekly pretzel consumption} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels} \]

Therefore, the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week is \( 63 \)."
"To find out how much Katherine will spend, we first calculate the cost of flowers for one basket and then multiply by the number of baskets.

For one basket:
- The cost of 3 petunias at $3.00 each is \(3 \times 3 = \$9.00\).
- The cost of 2 sweet potato vines at $2.50 each is \(2 \times 2.50 = \$5.00\).

Adding these together, the total cost for one basket is \(9 + 5 = \$14.00\).

Since Katherine has 5 baskets, the total cost for all baskets is \(5 \times 14 = \$70.00\).

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine how many roses Artemis and her father can plant, we need to account for the soil used by the sunflowers and carnations first.

Each sunflower requires 3 pounds of soil. If they plant 4 sunflowers, the total soil used for the sunflowers is:
\[ 4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds} \]

Each carnation requires 1.5 pounds of soil. If they plant 10 carnations, the total soil used for the carnations is:
\[ 10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations:
\[ 12 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 27 \text{ pounds} \]

They have a 30-pound bag of soil. Subtracting the soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total soil:
\[ 30 \text{ pounds} - 27 \text{ pounds} = 3 \text{ pounds} \]

Each rose requires 1 pound of soil. With 3 pounds of soil left, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ 3 \text{ pounds} \div 1 \text{ pound/rose} = 3 \text{ roses} \]

Therefore, the number of roses they can plant is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy in a year, we first calculate her monthly savings for shoes:

\[
\text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500
\]

Next, we determine her total savings for the year by multiplying her monthly savings by 12:

\[
\text{Yearly savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000
\]

Finally, to find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide her yearly savings by the cost of one pair of shoes:

\[
\text{Number of pairs of shoes} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6
\]

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year. The final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]"
"To determine the total time Emily needs to peel and saute 90 shrimp, we'll break down the problem into two parts: peeling the shrimp and sautéing the shrimp.

First, let's calculate the time required to peel 90 shrimp. Since Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, we can find the time as follows:

\[
\text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the time required to sauté 90 shrimp. The problem states that Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Therefore, to sauté 90 shrimp, we need to determine how many sets of 30 shrimp are in 90 shrimp:

\[
\text{Number of sets of 30 shrimp in 90 shrimp} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{30 \text{ shrimp/set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set of 30 shrimp takes 10 minutes to sauté, the total time to sauté 90 shrimp is:

\[
\text{Total time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 3 \text{ sets} \times 10 \text{ minutes/set} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, we add the time required for peeling and sautéing:

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total time it will take Emily to peel and sauté 90 shrimp is \(\boxed{45}\) minutes."
"To determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is, we need to calculate the net change in temperature over the given time periods.

1. **Cooling on Low:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on low for 3 hours.
   - Total cooling: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ degrees}\).

2. **Cooling on High:**
   - The air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour.
   - It ran on high for 4 hours.
   - Total cooling: \(3 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ degrees}\).

3. **No Cooling (Room Warms Up):**
   - The room warms up at a rate of 2 degrees per hour.
   - It was turned off for 2 hours.
   - Total warming: \(2 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ degrees}\).

Now, let's calculate the net change in temperature:
- Initial cooling: 6 degrees.
- Cooling on high: 12 degrees.
- Warming up: 4 degrees.

Net change in temperature:
\[ 6 \text{ degrees} + 12 \text{ degrees} - 4 \text{ degrees} = 14 \text{ degrees} \]

Since the room warms up by 14 degrees, it is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature. Therefore, the final temperature is 14 degrees higher than the starting temperature.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time. We know that Bill's father saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw it. This means Bill was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old when he saw the comet for the second time. Since the comet's orbit is 75 years, the first sighting was 75 years before the second sighting. Therefore, Bill was \(90 - 75 = 15\) years old when he saw the comet for the first time.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{15} \]"
"To determine the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we'll add up the checks for each category:

1. **Electric Bill Check**: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month. There are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(12 \text{ checks}\).

2. **Gas Bill Check**: Buford writes a check for the gas bill once per month. Similarly, there are 12 months in a year, so he writes \(12 \text{ checks}\).

3. **Church Check**: Buford writes a check to the church twice per month. Therefore, he writes \(2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ checks}\).

4. **Pest and Lawn Service Check**: Buford writes a check quarterly, which means he writes \(4 \text{ checks}\) per year.

Now, we sum up all the checks:
\[ 12 \text{ (electric bill)} + 12 \text{ (gas bill)} + 24 \text{ (church)} + 4 \text{ (pest and lawn service)} = 52 \text{ checks} \]

Thus, the total number of checks Buford writes per year is:
\[
\boxed{52}

"To determine the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day, we start by defining the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as \( F \). According to the problem, the first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. This gives us the following relationships:

- Flights to Greece: \( \frac{3}{4}F \)
- Flights to France: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)
- Flights to Germany: \( \frac{1}{4}F \)

We are also informed that the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, and this is half the number of trips the first plane makes in a day. Therefore, we can write:

\[ F = 2 \times 44 = 88 \]

Next, we calculate the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day:

\[ \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{4} \times 88 = 22 \]

Thus, the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day is \( 22 \).

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{22} \]"
"To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we start by calculating the duration of each wolf's howl:

- Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) seconds.
- Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined, which is \(20 + 40 = 60\) seconds.

Next, we sum the durations of all three wolves:
- Combined duration: \(20 + 40 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

Finally, we convert the combined duration from seconds to minutes:
- \(120\) seconds is equivalent to \(120 \div 60 = 2\) minutes.

Therefore, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is \(\boxed{2}\) minutes."
"To find out how much money Adam had to contribute from his savings, we start by calculating the total amount of money he received from his parents. Adam's mother gave him $6, and his father gave him twice that amount, which is $12. Adding these amounts together gives us:

\[ 6 + 12 = 18 \]

Adam spent $30 on the trousers. To determine how much he had to contribute from his savings, we subtract the total amount of money he received from the cost of the trousers:

\[ 30 - 18 = 12 \]

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 12 \]"
"To find Wilfred's age, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Given:
- The total age of the children is 20 years.
- Akbar is 3 years old.
- Alessandro is 4 years old.
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.
- The total age of the children is \( A + A_s + H + W = 20 \).

Substituting the known ages:
\[ 3 + 4 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ 7 + H + W = 20 \]
\[ H + W = 13 \]

The average age of the group is:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since Helene is twice the average age:
\[ H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]

Substituting Helene's age into the equation \( H + W = 13 \):
\[ 10 + W = 13 \]
\[ W = 13 - 10 \]
\[ W = 3 \]

Therefore, Wilfred's age is \(\boxed{3}\)."
"To determine how much Walter's lawyer will contribute, we first calculate the total amount collected from his neighbors and the online fund:

- From neighbors: $500
- From online fund: $1500

Total collected so far: $500 + $1500 = $2000

Next, we add the $200 given by Walter's friend to the total collected so far:

- Total collected so far: $2000
- Amount given by Walter's friend: $200

Total amount donated by everyone else: $2000 + $200 = $2200

The lawyer will donate three times as much as everyone else donates. Therefore, the lawyer's contribution is:

- Amount donated by everyone else: $2200
- Lawyer's contribution: 3 * $2200 = $6600

Thus, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute $6600."
"To determine the number of people in the church next door, we start by calculating the total number of cookies. There were 100 guests, and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies is:

\[ 100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies/guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies} \]

The bride decided to give half of the cookies to the church next door. So, the number of cookies given to the church is:

\[ \frac{1500 \text{ cookies}}{2} = 750 \text{ cookies} \]

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person received:

\[ \frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies/person}} = 50 \text{ people} \]

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the proportion of the watermelon that each adult and each child gets, given that each adult's slice is twice as big as each child's slice.

Let's denote the total volume of the watermelon as \( V \).

Let the volume of each child's slice be \( x \). Then, the volume of each adult's slice would be \( 2x \).

Since there are 4 children and 2 adults, the total volume of the watermelon can be expressed as the sum of the volumes of all slices:

\[
4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x
\]

This means the total volume \( V \) of the watermelon is \( 8x \).

Now, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets. Each adult's slice is \( 2x \), and the total volume of the watermelon is \( 8x \).

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Volume of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total volume of the watermelon}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

The final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm, we need to sum up the total time required for each step and then subtract this total from 5:00 pm.

1. **Time to make the cake batter:** 20 minutes
2. **Time to bake the cake:** 30 minutes
3. **Time to cool the cake:** 2 hours = 120 minutes
4. **Time to frost the cake:** 10 minutes

First, we sum these times:
\[ 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert 180 minutes into hours:
\[ 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Jordan needs 3 hours to complete all the steps. She wants the cake to be ready by 5:00 pm. To find the latest start time, we subtract 3 hours from 5:00 pm:
\[ 5:00 \text{ pm} - 3 \text{ hours} = 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is:
\[ 2:00 \text{ pm} \]

"To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider the fixed cost of renting the studio and the variable cost based on the number of students and the number of sessions per week.

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the variable cost per session is \(10 \times 1.50 = 15\) dollars.
3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, which is \(25 + 15 = 40\) dollars.
4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.
5. **Sessions per Month**: Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the total number of sessions per month is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) sessions.
6. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings per month is the total cost per session multiplied by the number of sessions per month, which is \(40 \times 12 = 480\) dollars.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480."
"To determine how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we start by setting up the equations based on the given information.

Peter has 4 boxes with \( p \) chocolate bars each, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64:
\[
4p = 64
\]
Solving for \( p \):
\[
p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
\]

Martha has 7 boxes with \( m \) chocolate bars each, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56:
\[
7m = 56
\]
Solving for \( m \):
\[
m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

Now, we find the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box between Peter and Martha:
\[
p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
\]

Therefore, Peter has \(\boxed{8}\) more chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To determine the number of porcupines in the park after a year, we start with the initial population of 50 porcupines. Given that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population, we calculate the number of female porcupines as follows:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Number of babies per year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Adding the babies born in a year to the initial population gives us the total number of porcupines after a year:

\[
\text{Total number of porcupines after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[
\boxed{1490}

"To determine the cost to fill the swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to convert it to gallons.
3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool based on the cost per gallon.

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Pool

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume \( V \) can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism:

\[ V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} \]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]

### Step 2: Convert Volume to Gallons

The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons needed:

\[ \text{Gallons} = V \times 5.9 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Cost

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) can be calculated as:

\[ C = \text{Gallons} \times 0.10 \]

Let's perform the calculations step by step.

#### Step 1: Calculate the Volume

\[ V = 25 \times 14 \times 4 \]
\[ V = 25 \times 56 \]
\[ V = 1400 \text{ cubic feet} \]

#### Step 2: Convert Volume to Gallons

\[ \text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 \]
\[ \text{Gallons} = 8260 \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Cost

\[ C = 8260 \times 0.10 \]
\[ C = 826 \]

Therefore, the cost to fill the pool is $826.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{826} \]"
"To determine the total number of sticks, we start by identifying the quantities of each color of stick:

1. **Red Sticks**: There are 9 red sticks.
2. **Blue Sticks**: The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks. Therefore, the number of blue sticks is \(9 + 5 = 14\).
3. **Yellow Sticks**: The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks. Therefore, the number of yellow sticks is \(14 - 3 = 11\).

Next, we sum the quantities of all the sticks:
- Red sticks: 9
- Blue sticks: 14
- Yellow sticks: 11

Adding these together gives:
\[ 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 \]

Thus, the total number of sticks is \(\boxed{34}\)."

"To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we start by calculating the laps each person can run:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps.
2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey runs \(10 + 4 = 14\) laps.
3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn runs \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\) laps.
4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn runs \(7 - 2 = 5\) laps.

Now, to find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, we subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run:
\[ 10 - 5 = 5 \]

Therefore, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn. The final answer is:

  \text{Ms. B's contribution} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- **Total water pumped on Day 1**: 
  \[
  \text{Total on Day 1} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### Day 2:
- **Wanda's contribution**: \( \frac{2}{3} \) of her contribution on Day 1.
  \[
  \text{Wanda's contribution on Day 2} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- **Ms. B's contribution**: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of her contribution on Day 1.
  \[
  \text{Ms. B's contribution on Day 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
  \]
- **Total water pumped on Day 2**: 
  \[
  \text{Total on Day 2} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### Total water pumped in two days:
\[
\text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Remaining capacity of the tank:
\[
\text{Remaining capacity} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
\]

The number of gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full is \(\boxed{6000}\)."
"To determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to work backwards through the given information about the power bank's charge loss.

First, we know that after 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its charge each hour. This means that after 5 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times (1 - 0.09)^5 = C \times 0.91^5 \]

Next, for the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of its charge each hour. So, after another 3 hours, the charge remaining is:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times (1 - 0.07)^3 = C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 \]

We know that after these 8 hours, the charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ C \times 0.91^5 \times 0.93^3 = 0.28 \]

We need to calculate \( 0.91^5 \) and \( 0.93^3 \):
\[ 0.91^5 \approx 0.656 \]
\[ 0.93^3 \approx 0.817 \]

So,
\[ 0.656 \times 0.817 \approx 0.534 \]

We know that:
\[ 0.534 \times C = 0.28 \]
\[ C = \frac{0.28}{0.534} \approx 0.524 \]

Therefore, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately \( 52.4\% \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{52.4\%} \]"
"To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car, we first calculate the total amount she needs to save. 

20% of $10,000 is calculated as:
\[ 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we calculate Janet's weekly earnings. She earns $10 per hour from her job and $15 per hour from tips, so her total weekly earnings are:
\[ 10 + 15 = 25 \text{ dollars per hour} \]
\[ 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ dollars per week} \]

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save $2000, we divide the total amount she needs to save by her weekly earnings:
\[ \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, Janet will need to work for 2 weeks to save the down payment for the car. The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To determine how many plums Jamaar can buy, we start by calculating the total cost of the fruits he has already purchased:

- Peaches: 3 peaches at $0.5 each = 3 * $0.5 = $1.5
- Pears: 4 pears at $0.5 each = 4 * $0.5 = $2.0
- Kiwis: 2 kiwis at $1.0 each = 2 * $1.0 = $2.0
- Apples: 5 apples at $0.75 each = 5 * $0.75 = $3.75

Adding these costs together gives the total spent so far:
Total spent = $1.5 + $2.0 + $2.0 + $3.75 = $9.25

Jamaar has $10 to spend initially. After purchasing the fruits, the remaining money is:
Remaining money = $10 - $9.25 = $0.75

Plums cost $0.25 each. To find out how many plums he can buy with the remaining $0.75, we perform the division:
Number of plums = $0.75 / $0.25 = 3

Therefore, the number of plums Jamaar can buy is 3."
"To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we start by calculating the total number of pieces of sweets Anne purchased. She bought 15 packs, and each pack contains 60 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces is:

\[
15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces}
\]

Anne kept 2 packs for herself, so the number of packs she gave to her 10 friends is:

\[
15 \text{ packs} - 2 \text{ packs} = 13 \text{ packs}
\]

These 13 packs are to be divided equally among her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the number of packs given away by the number of friends:

\[
\frac{13 \text{ packs}}{10 \text{ friends}} = 1.3 \text{ packs per friend}
\]

Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of pieces each friend received is:

\[
1.3 \text{ packs per friend} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend}
\]

Thus, each of her friends received \(\boxed{78}\) pieces of sweets."
"To find the price of carrots after three years with an annual increase of 5%, we use the compound interest formula:

\[ P(t) = P_0 \times (1 + r)^t \]

Given:
- Initial price \( P_0 = 120 \) dollars
- Annual growth rate \( r = 0.05 \)
- Time \( t = 3 \) years

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ P(3) = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3 \]
\[ P(3) = 120 \times (1.05)^3 \]

Calculating \( (1.05)^3 \):

\[ (1.05)^3 = 1.05 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 \approx 1.157625 \]

Now, multiply this by the initial price:

\[ P(3) = 120 \times 1.157625 \approx 138.915 \]

Rounding to the nearest integer:

\[ P(3) \approx 139 \]

Therefore, the price of carrots after three years would be approximately **$139**."
"To determine the number of selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, we start by noting that she divided 72 pictures into 8 albums. This means each album contains:

\[ \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album} \]

Given that 3 albums are for selfies only and 2 albums are for portraits only, we can calculate the number of selfies and portraits as follows:

- **Selfies**: \( 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies} \)
- **Portraits**: \( 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits} \)

Adding the number of selfies and portraits together:

\[ 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \]

Therefore, the total number of selfies and portraits is 45. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{45} \]"
"To determine how long James spends reading 18 pages, given that he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes, we can use the concept of ratios and multiplication.

First, we find out how long it takes to read one page. Since 3 pages take 10 minutes, the time to read one page is:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} \]

Next, to find out how long it takes to read 18 pages, we multiply the time per page by 18:

\[ \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = 60 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the total time James spends reading is:

\[ \boxed{60} \]"
"To find out how many guests the hotel has now, we start with the initial number of guests, which is 100.

- 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100:
  \[
  100 - 24 = 76
  \]

- 15 guests checked out late, so we subtract 15 from 76:
  \[
  76 - 15 = 61
  \]

- In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who checked out late. Since 15 guests checked out late, twice that number is:
  \[
  2 \times 15 = 30
  \]
  Adding these 30 guests to the 61 remaining guests:
  \[
  61 + 30 = 91
  \]

- After dinner, 7 more guests checked in, so we add 7 to 91:
  \[
  91 + 7 = 98
  \]

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests."
"To find out how many bananas John has, we'll add the bananas he picks each day.

- On Wednesday, he picks 4 bananas.
- On Thursday, he picks 6 bananas.
- On Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday, which is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) bananas.

Now, we sum these amounts:
\[ 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 \]

Therefore, the total number of bananas John has is 22."
"To determine how many points Aries is sure to get, we'll break down the quiz into its components and calculate the number of questions she is sure to answer correctly.

1. **Total number of questions:**
   \[
   60
   \]

2. **Number of easy questions:**
   \[
   40\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
   \]

3. **Number of average and difficult questions:**
   Since 40% are easy, the remaining 60% are equally divided between average and difficult questions:
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.60 \times 60 = 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average questions} = \text{Difficult questions} = \frac{36}{2} = 18

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( S \) represent the number of small stuffed animals sold, and \( L \) represent the number of large stuffed animals sold. We know from the problem that each small stuffed animal costs $4 and each large stuffed animal costs three times that, so each large stuffed animal costs $12. The total earnings from the sales are $120, and she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.

We can set up the following equations:
1. The total earnings equation: \( 12L + 4S = 120 \)
2. The relationship between the number of small and large stuffed animals sold: \( S = 2L \)

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ 12L + 4(2L) = 120 \]
\[ 12L + 8L = 120 \]
\[ 20L = 120 \]
\[ L = 6 \]

Now, using the relationship \( S = 2L \):
\[ S = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of small stuffed animals sold is \( 12 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]"
"To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we start by calculating the daily total of sandwiches consumed by the family. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, the wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and the son eats 2 sandwiches per day. Therefore, the total number of sandwiches eaten per day is:

\[ 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day} \]

Next, we need to find out how many sandwiches are eaten in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily total by 7:

\[ 11 \times 7 = 77 \text{ sandwiches in one week} \]

Thus, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week."
"To determine how much money Suzanne has left after her earnings and expenses, we start by calculating her total earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.

First, we calculate the earnings from cookies:
\[ 80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1/\text{cookie} = \$80 \]

Next, we calculate the earnings from cupcakes:
\[ 60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4/\text{cupcake} = \$240 \]

Adding these amounts gives her total earnings:
\[ \$80 + \$240 = \$320 \]

Suzanne then gives each of her two sisters $10, so the total amount given to her sisters is:
\[ 2 \times \$10 = \$20 \]

Subtracting the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings leaves her with:
\[ \$320 - \$20 = \$300 \]

Therefore, the final amount of money Suzanne has left is:
\[ \$300 \]"
"The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs, which totals 60 eggs. After the twins found their eggs, 40 eggs remained. Since all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends, the number of eggs found by the friends is 40 - 10 = 30 eggs. Therefore, the friends found 30 eggs."
"To determine how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we follow these steps:

1. **Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe:**
   - A dwarf with an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - A dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 50% more than a dwarf with an iron pickaxe.
   - Calculate 50% of 12 pounds: \( 0.5 \times 12 = 6 \) pounds.
   - Add this to the 12 pounds: \( 12 + 6 = 18 \) pounds per day.

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a day:**
   - One dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 18 pounds of ore per day.

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a day:**
   - Multiply the daily ore mining rate by the number of dwarves: \( 40 \times 18 = 720 \) pounds per day.

4. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Multiply the daily ore mining rate by the number of days: \( 720 \times 30 = 21600 \) pounds.

Thus, the total amount of ore mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month is 21600 pounds.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we start by understanding the pricing structure of the other packages and then apply the proportionality.

Given:
- The first package with 2 sandwiches costs $3.
- The second package with 4 sandwiches costs $6.

First, we calculate the price per sandwich for each of these packages:
- For the first package: 
  \[
  \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]
- For the second package:
  \[
  \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  \]

Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is consistently $1.5. Now, we apply this price per sandwich to the third package, which contains 8 sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \(\boxed{12}\) dollars."

\[ 0.10 \times 2000 = 200 \]

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 200 \]"
"To determine the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of red balloons that burst:**
   Sally initially had 25 red balloons, and 40% of them burst.
   \[
   \text{Red balloons that burst} = 25 \times 0.40 = 10
   \]
   Therefore, the remaining red balloons are:
   \[
   25 - 10 = 15
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of yellow balloons released:**
   Sally initially had 12 yellow balloons, and she released half of them.
   \[
   \text{Yellow balloons released} = 12 \times 0.50 = 6
   \]
   Therefore, the remaining yellow balloons are:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of blue balloons added:**
   Sally found 8 blue balloons and added 75% of them to her remaining clutch of balloons.
   \[
   \text{Blue balloons added} = 8 \times 0.75 = 6
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of balloons carried into the school:**
   Adding the remaining red, green, and yellow balloons to the blue balloons added:
   \[
   15 \text{ (red)} + 7 \text{ (green)} + 6 \text{ (yellow)} + 6 \text{ (blue)} = 34

Therefore, the total number of balloons Sally carried into the school is **34**."
"To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario and their respective outcomes.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having a substitute teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of the substitute teacher collecting the homework: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of having to turn in homework in this scenario: 50% or 0.50

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
   - Probability of having the normal teacher: 50% or 0.50
   - Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher: 40% or 0.40
   - Probability of not getting an extension from the normal teacher: 60% or 0.60
   - Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate the assignment: 20% or 0.20
   - Probability of not convincing the teacher: 80% or 0.80

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework:

- **Substitute Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 50% or 0.50

- **Normal Teacher Scenario:**
  - Probability of not getting an extension: 60% or 0.60
  - Probability of having to turn in homework: 100% or 1.00 (since he would have to turn it in if he doesn't get an extension)

Now, we combine these probabilities:

- Probability of having to turn in homework in the substitute teacher scenario: 50% or 0.50
- Probability of having to turn in homework in the normal teacher scenario: 60% (since 60% of the time he doesn't get an extension and thus has to turn it in)

The total probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:

\[ 0.50 + 0.60 = 1.10 \]

However, since probabilities cannot exceed 1, we need to normalize this to a percentage:

\[ \frac{1.10}{2} = 0.55 \]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is:

\[ 0.55 \times 100 = 55\% \]

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{55} \]"
"To determine how many tickets each graduate will receive, we start by calculating the total number of seats that are already accounted for. This includes 950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty, which sums up to 1250 seats.

Next, we subtract the accounted seats from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center to find out how many seats are left for graduates and their guests:
\[ 6000 - 1250 = 4750 \]

Now, we need to divide the remaining seats by the number of graduates to find out how many tickets each graduate will receive:
\[ \frac{4750}{950} = 5 \]

Therefore, each graduate will receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat, we need to establish the relationships between the sizes of the jelly beans and then calculate the number of small beans based on the given information.

1. **Large Jelly Beans:**
   - Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to fill up.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans:**
   - He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ medium-sized beans}
     \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans:**
   - Eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to 150 medium-sized beans, we use the ratio:
     \[
     150 \text{ medium-sized beans} \times 3 \text{ small beans per medium-sized bean} = 450 \text{ small beans}
     \]

Thus, the number of small beans Grandpa can eat is:

"To determine the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of soda bottles needed:**
   - Richard's driveway is 24 feet wide.
   - He wants to place a bottle of soda every 3 feet.
   - The number of bottles is calculated by dividing the width of the driveway by the distance between each bottle:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{3 \text{ feet/bottle}} = 8 \text{ bottles}
     \]

2. **Determine the time to set off each bottle:**
   - It takes Richard 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next and drop the candy.
   - Since he needs to go from the first bottle to the last bottle, he will go through 7 intervals (from bottle 1 to bottle 2, bottle 2 to bottle 3, ..., bottle 7 to bottle 8).

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - The time to go from one bottle to the next is 5 seconds.
   - Since there are 7 intervals, the total time is:
     \[
     7 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ seconds/interval} = 35 \text{ seconds}

"To determine how much money Amor will have left after her purchases, we start by calculating the total cost of the cheese she buys. 

First, we calculate the cost of the Parmesan cheese:
\[
\text{Cost of Parmesan cheese} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 11 \text{ dollars/pound} = 22 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the cost of the mozzarella cheese:
\[
\text{Cost of mozzarella cheese} = 3 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding these costs together gives the total cost of the cheese:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 22 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

Amor starts with $50. To find out how much money she will have left after her purchases, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
\[
\text{Money left} = 50 \text{ dollars} - 40 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Amor will have left to buy meat is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To determine how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to his loans and the income he lost while in college, we need to calculate the total amount he borrowed and the total income he would have earned if he had worked the entire time.

First, calculate the total amount Jim borrowed during his college years:
\[ 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000 \]

Next, calculate his post-college income:
\[ 25,000 \times 3 = 75,000 \]

Now, determine the total income he would have earned if he had worked the entire time, including the years he spent in college:
\[ 75,000 \times 8 = 600,000 \]

Subtract the total amount borrowed from the total income to find out how much he needs to earn to repay the loans and make up for the lost income:
\[ 600,000 - 200,000 = 400,000 \]

To find out how long it would take him to earn $400,000 at his post-college income of $75,000 per year, we divide the total amount needed by his annual income:
\[ \frac{400,000}{75,000} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.33 \]

Since Jim cannot work a fraction of a year, we round up to the next whole number, which means it would take him 6 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 6 \]"
"To determine the total amount of fabric Jim needs, we start by calculating the dimensions of each piece of fabric required. The bed measures 6 feet in length and 8 feet in width. Each piece of fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Thus, the dimensions of each piece of fabric are:
- Length: \(6 + 2 = 8\) feet
- Width: \(8 + 2 = 10\) feet

Next, we calculate the area of one piece of fabric using the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length multiplied by width:
\[ \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \, \text{feet} \times 10 \, \text{feet} = 80 \, \text{square feet} \]

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2:
\[ \text{Total area} = 2 \times 80 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet} \]

Therefore, the total amount of fabric Jim needs to buy is:
\[ \boxed{160} \]"
"To find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we will calculate the number of letters delivered each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   The post office delivered 425 letters.

2. **Tuesday:**
   The number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 17 more than one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters on Tuesday} = \frac{1}{5} \times 425 + 17
   \]
   First, calculate one-fifth of 425:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
   \]
   Then add 17:
   \[
   85 + 17 = 102
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 102 letters on Tuesday.

3. **Wednesday:**
   The number of letters delivered on Wednesday is 5 more than twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Number of letters on Wednesday} = 2 \times 102 + 5
   \]
   First, calculate twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday:
   \[
   2 \times 102 = 204
   \]
   Then add 5:
   \[
   204 + 5 = 209
   \]
   So, the post office delivered 209 letters on Wednesday.

4. **Total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday:**
   \[
   \text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209
   \]
   Add these numbers together:
   \[
   425 + 102 = 527
   \]
   \[
   527 + 209 = 736
   \]

Therefore, the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday is \(\boxed{736}\)."

"To determine how much Johnny's dad lost on average over the three races, we will follow these steps:

1. **First Race:**
   Johnny's dad lost $5.

2. **Second Race:**
   He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - Amount lost in the first race: $5
   - Twice the amount lost: \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
   - Amount won in the second race: \(10 + 1 = 11\)
   - Therefore, he lost $11 in the second race.

3. **Third Race:**
   He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Amount won in the second race: $11
   - Amount lost in the third race: \(1.5 \times 11 = 16.5\)

Now, let's calculate the total amount lost over the three races:
- Amount lost in the first race: $5
- Amount lost in the second race: $11
- Amount lost in the third race: $16.5
- Total amount lost: \(5 + 11 + 16.5 = 32.5\)

To find the average amount lost per race, we divide the total amount lost by the number of races:
- Number of races: 3
- Average amount lost per race: \(\frac{32.5}{3} = 10.8333\)

Therefore, the average amount lost per race is \(\boxed{10.8333}\)."
"To find the total population in South America, we start by calculating the total number of cities. Given that there are 26 countries and each country has 5 cities, the total number of cities is:

\[ 26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities} \]

Next, we know that each city has 1000 people living in it. Therefore, the total population in South America is:

\[ 130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130,000 \text{ people} \]

"To find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier after their growth over the summer, we first convert and then compare their heights.

Xavier's initial height was 4 feet, which is equivalent to:
\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

After growing 3 inches, Xavier's current height is:
\[ 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches} \]

Cole's initial height was 50 inches, and after growing 2 inches, his current height is:
\[ 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches} \]

The difference in their heights now is:
\[ 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch} \]

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is:
\[ \boxed{1} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equation based on the given information. Let's denote the amount taken by the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

The total amount taken by all three people is $1920. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation:
\[ x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920 \]
\[ 4x + 240 = 1920 \]

Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
\[ 4x = 1680 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 420 \]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( 420 \).

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of hours each painter worked, we follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days the painters worked:
   - The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day for 3 weeks.
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, 3 weeks is \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \) days.
   - Therefore, the total number of days worked is \( 21 \times \frac{3}{8} = \frac{63}{8} = 7.875 \) days.

2. Determine the total number of hours worked by all painters:
   - Each painter works \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day.
   - With 4 painters, the total number of hours worked is \( 7.875 \times 4 = 31.5 \) hours.

3. Calculate the total number of hours worked by each painter:
   - Since there are 4 painters, the total number of hours worked by each painter is \( \frac{31.5}{4} = 7.875 \) hours.

Thus, each painter put in 7.875 hours of work. The final numerical answer is:
\[ 7.875 \]"
"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information. Let \( x \) represent the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set. According to the problem:

- In the first set, Rory retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls.
- The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19.

We can write the equation for the total number of balls as:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To solve this equation, we first combine like terms:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we convert \( 2x \) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[
2x = \frac{4x}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Subtract 4 from both sides to isolate the fraction:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"To find the price of the car in 2010, we start with the initial price of $20,000 in 2007 and apply the depreciation rate of 21% per year. This means the car retains 79% of its value each year.

Let's calculate the price step by step:

1. **2007 to 2008:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2008} = 20000 \times 0.79 = 15800
   \]

2. **2008 to 2009:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2009} = 15800 \times 0.79 = 12522
   \]

3. **2009 to 2010:**
   \[
   \text{Price in 2010} = 12522 \times 0.79 = 9830.18

"Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total number of people on the train at the final stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**
   Romeo boards the train with 120 people.

2. **First stop:**
   At the first stop, 20 more people board the train.
   \[
   120 + 20 = 140
   \]
   So, there are 140 people on the train after the first stop.

3. **Second stop:**
   At the second stop, 50 people disembark the train. Twice that number, which is \(2 \times 50 = 100\) people, board the train.
   \[
   140 - 50 + 100 = 190
   \]
   So, there are 190 people on the train after the second stop.

4. **Third stop:**
   At the third stop, 80 more people disembark the train.
   \[
   190 - 80 = 110

"To solve the problem using a system of equations, let's define the variables first:

- Let \( B \) represent the number of slices Becky ate.
- Let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate.
- Let \( S \) represent the number of slices Silvia ate.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas, so the total number of slices is \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \).
2. Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake: \( B = J + 3 \).
3. Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake: \( S = 2J \).
4. Becky ate 10 slices: \( B = 10 \).

Using the information that \( B = 10 \), we can substitute into the first equation to find \( J \):

\[ 10 = J + 3 \]
\[ J = 10 - 3 \]
\[ J = 7 \]

Now, using \( J = 7 \), we can find \( S \):

\[ S = 2J \]
\[ S = 2 \times 7 \]
\[ S = 14 \]

Finally, we can find the total number of slices eaten by adding \( B \), \( J \), and \( S \):

\[ \text{Total slices} = B + J + S \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 10 + 7 + 14 \]
\[ \text{Total slices} = 31 \]

"To find out how much Anthony spends on postage, we start by calculating the number of big coupons he wants to send. Since he wants to send twice as many big coupons as small coupons, and he plans to send 700 small coupons, the number of big coupons is:

\[ 2 \times 700 = 1400 \]

Next, we calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Each small coupon costs 5 cents, and he is sending 700 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the small coupons is:

\[ 700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents} \]

Now, we calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents, and he is sending 1400 of them. Therefore, the total cost for the big coupons is:

\[ 1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents} \]

To find the total cost of mailing all the coupons, we add the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons:

\[ 3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents} \]

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert the total cost from cents to dollars:

\[ 24500 \text{ cents} = 245 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the total amount Anthony spends on postage is:

\[ \boxed{245} \]"

Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is \(24\)."
"To determine the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of trucks with mechanical failures:**
   - Mr. Hezekiah initially had 20 trucks.
   - A quarter of these trucks had mechanical failures.
   - Therefore, the number of trucks with mechanical failures is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser:**
   - The total number of trucks is 20.
   - The number of trucks with mechanical failures is 5.
   - Thus, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser is:
     \[
     20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the successful trucks:**
   - Each truck carries 20 tons of fertiliser.
   - The number of successful trucks is 15.
   - Therefore, the total amount of fertiliser delivered is:
     \[
     15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
     \]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is \(\boxed{300}\)."
"To determine the cost Dennis will incur to purchase 6 pounds of butter with the promotion, we need to consider the following:

- Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter.
- The promotion is ""buy one pound of butter get one half off,"" meaning for every 2 pounds, he pays for 1 pound.

First, calculate the number of sets of 2 pounds Dennis needs to buy:
\[
\text{Number of sets of 2 pounds} = \frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ pounds per set}} = 3 \text{ sets}
\]

For each set of 2 pounds, Dennis only pays for 1 pound:
\[
\text{Cost per set} = 1 \text{ pound} \times \$4.00 \text{ per pound} = \$4.00
\]

Since Dennis needs 3 sets:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 3 \text{ sets} \times \$4.00 \text{ per set} = \$12.00
\]

Thus, the total cost for Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To determine the total cost for Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of guests invited:**
   - Kayla's classmates: 25
   - Girls in her dance class: 7
   - Family members: 13
   - Total guests invited: \(25 + 7 + 13 = 45\)

2. **Subtract the number of guests who could not come:**
   - Guests who could not come: 4
   - Guests who will attend: \(45 - 4 = 41\)

3. **Calculate the additional fee for the guests beyond the initial 20:**
   - Number of guests beyond the initial 20: \(41 - 20 = 21\)
   - Additional fee per guest: $6
   - Total additional fee: \(21 \times 6 = 126\)

4. **Add the base fee to the additional fee:**
   - Base fee: $125
   - Total additional fee: $126
   - Total cost: \(125 + 126 = 251\)

Therefore, the total cost for Kayla's birthday party is **$251**."
"To determine how much money Maggie and Riza have left after spending a portion of their initial amounts, we start with the initial amounts given: $60 for both Maggie and Riza.

First, we calculate how much Maggie spent. She spent a quarter of her money:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \]
Thus, the amount of money Maggie has left is:
\[ 60 - 15 = 45 \]

Next, we calculate how much Riza spent. She spent one-third of her money:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
Thus, the amount of money Riza has left is:
\[ 60 - 20 = 40 \]

To find the total amount of money they have left together, we add the amounts left for Maggie and Riza:
\[ 45 + 40 = 85 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money that Maggie and Riza have left is:
\[ \boxed{85} \]"
"To determine how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we start by calculating the total number of bananas consumed by the first two monkeys in a week. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day, so in a week (7 days), it eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ bananas} \]

The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey each day, so it eats:
\[ 10 \text{ bananas/day} + 4 \text{ bananas/day} = 14 \text{ bananas/day} \]
In a week, the second monkey eats:
\[ 14 \text{ bananas/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 98 \text{ bananas} \]

Adding the bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys in a week gives:
\[ 70 \text{ bananas} + 98 \text{ bananas} = 168 \text{ bananas} \]

Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas in total, the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week is:
\[ 315 \text{ bananas} - 168 \text{ bananas} = 147 \text{ bananas} \]

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide the total number of bananas eaten by the third monkey in a week by 7:
\[ \frac{147 \text{ bananas}}{7 \text{ days}} = 21 \text{ bananas/day} \]

Therefore, the third monkey eats \(\boxed{21}\) bananas each day."
"Teddy finished half of a 500-piece puzzle, which means he placed 250 pieces. Then, he finished another 500-piece puzzle, placing 500 pieces. Therefore, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is 250 + 500 = 750 pieces.

The final numerical answer is 750."
"Jenny needs to buy 15 roses, and each rose costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the roses is:

\[ 15 \text{ roses} \times \$2/\text{rose} = \$30 \]

Jenny has five $5 bills, which totals:

\[ 5 \times \$5 = \$25 \]

The difference between the total cost and the amount Jenny has is the change she needs:

\[ \$30 - \$25 = \$5 \]

Since the florist only provides change in quarters, and each quarter is worth $0.25, the number of quarters Jenny will receive is:

\[ \frac{\$5}{\$0.25/\text{quarter}} = 20 \text{ quarters} \]

Thus, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:

\[ \boxed{20} \]"
"To find out how much money Terry makes in total, we'll start by calculating the revenue from each item separately and then summing them up.

"To determine how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we start by calculating the number of toothpicks she has already saved. She saves 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, which totals:

\[ 10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Next, we find out how many more toothpicks she needs to reach her goal of 200 toothpicks:

\[ 200 \text{ toothpicks} - 120 \text{ toothpicks} = 80 \text{ toothpicks} \]

Since she saves 10 toothpicks each week, we calculate the number of weeks required to save the remaining 80 toothpicks:

\[ \frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks} \]

Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks. The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{8}

"To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to consider the total distance he walked and his walking speed.

1. **Total Distance:**
   - James walked halfway to the store, which is 2 miles.
   - He then walked back home, which is another 2 miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance he walked is \(2 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 4 \text{ miles}\).

2. **Speed:**
   - James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

3. **Time Calculation:**
   - Time is calculated using the formula: \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).
   - Substituting the values, we get: \( \text{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 1 \text{ hour} \).

"To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we start by calculating the total cost if she bought the bananas individually.

Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch contains 4 bananas. Therefore, the total number of bananas she buys is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas per bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas} \]

Given that each banana costs $0.80, the total cost if she bought the bananas individually is:
\[ 40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80 \text{ per banana} = \$32.00 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches. Since each bunch costs $3.00 and she buys 10 bunches, the total cost if she bought the bananas in bunches is:
\[ 10 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00 \text{ per bunch} = \$30.00 \]

To find out how much money Jenny saved, we subtract the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches from the total cost of buying them individually:
\[ \$32.00 - \$30.00 = \$2.00 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Jenny saved is:

\[ S + H = 100 \]
\[ H = S + 60 \]

Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:

\[ S + (S + 60) = 100 \]

Simplifying this, we have:

\[ 2S + 60 = 100 \]

Subtracting 60 from both sides gives:

\[ 2S = 40 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we find:

\[ S = 20 \]

Therefore, the amount of fence left over for Sam is:

"To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we'll follow a step-by-step approach focusing on the calculations:

1. **Calculate the total number of periods John takes each day:**
   - A normal student has 6 periods.
   - John has 2 extra classes.
   - Therefore, John takes \(6 + 2 = 8\) periods each day.

2. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each day:**
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - John has 8 periods each day.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each day is \(8 \times 40 = 320\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time John spends in class each week:**
   - John goes to class 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total time spent in class each week is \(320 \times 5 = 1600\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday:**
   - John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday.
   - First, find the total weekly minutes:
     \[
     1600 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - Then, calculate the extra learning time:
     \[
     \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total time John spends learning each week:**
   - Total time in class each week: 1600 minutes.
   - Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday: 100 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning each week is:
     \[
     1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Convert the total time spent learning from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Therefore, the total time spent learning in hours is:

"To determine the initial amount of meat on the triceratops before the Tyrannosaurus rex ate, we can work backwards through the given information.

1. The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat, which means before the Allosaurus ate, there were 270 kilograms left.
2. Before the Allosaurus ate, the amount of meat was twice the amount left after the Allosaurus ate, because the Allosaurus ate half of what was left after the velociraptors scavenged. Therefore, before the Allosaurus ate, there were \( 270 \times 2 = 540 \) kilograms of meat.
3. Before the velociraptors scavenged, the amount of meat was twice the amount left after the velociraptors scavenged, because the velociraptors left half of what was left after the Tyrannosaurus rex ate. Therefore, before the velociraptors scavenged, there were \( 540 \times 2 = 1080 \) kilograms of meat.
4. Before the Tyrannosaurus rex ate, the amount of meat was twice the amount left after the Tyrannosaurus rex ate, because the Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of what was left. Therefore, before the Tyrannosaurus rex ate, there were \( 1080 \times 2 = 2160 \) kilograms of meat.

Thus, the initial amount of meat on the triceratops before the Tyrannosaurus rex ate was 2160 kilograms.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the cost of painting the room, we first calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted. The room has four walls: two north-south walls and two east-west walls.

The area of the north and south walls is:
\[ 2 \times (10 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet} \]

The area of the east and west walls is:
\[ 2 \times (5 \text{ feet} \times 8 \text{ feet}) = 2 \times 40 \text{ square feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]

Adding these areas together gives the total area to be painted:
\[ 160 \text{ square feet} + 80 \text{ square feet} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, we need to determine how many gallons of paint are required. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, the number of gallons needed is:
\[ \frac{240 \text{ square feet}}{20 \text{ square feet per gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons} \]

Each gallon of paint costs $12, so the total cost to paint the room is:
\[ 12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 \text{ dollars per gallon} = 144 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, the final cost to paint the room is:
\[ \boxed{144} \]"
"To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the sequence of events and the remaining sodas after each step.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Ellen starts with 12 sodas.
   - She shakes 3 sodas.
   - She takes 1 unshaken soda for herself.
   - This leaves 9 sodas: 3 shaken and 6 unshaken.

2. **Ellen's Brother's Actions:**
   - Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
   - This leaves 2 shaken sodas and 4 unshaken sodas.

3. **Ellen's Friend's Turn:**
   - Ellen's friend now has to choose 1 soda from the remaining 4 sodas (2 shaken and 2 unshaken).

We need to calculate the probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda.

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The total number of sodas left is 4.
   - The number of shaken sodas left is 2.
   - The probability that Ellen's friend gets a shaken soda is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas left.

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas left}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

5. **Expressing the Probability as a Percentage:**
   - To convert the probability to a percentage, we multiply by 100.

\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50\%
\]

Thus, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is \(\boxed{50\%}\)."
"To determine how far apart the two trains are after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train travels and then sum these distances.

1. **Speed of the first train:**
   - The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.

2. **Speed of the second train:**
   - The second train is traveling at half the speed of the first train.
   - Therefore, the speed of the second train is \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \) miles per hour.

3. **Distance traveled by the first train in 3 hours:**
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - For the first train: \( 60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \).

4. **Distance traveled by the second train in 3 hours:**
   - For the second train: \( 30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 90 \text{ miles} \).

5. **Total distance between the two trains after 3 hours:**
   - Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, the total distance between them is the sum of the distances each has traveled.
   - Total distance = Distance traveled by the first train + Distance traveled by the second train
   - Total distance = \( 180 \text{ miles} + 90 \text{ miles} = 270 \text{ miles} \).

Thus, the final numerical answer is 270 miles."
"To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th:**

"To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
- Length of the biggest slide: 300 feet
- Speed of the biggest slide: 60 feet/minute

The time to ride the biggest slide is given by:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
- Length of the second biggest slide: 240 feet
- Speed of the second biggest slide: 80 feet/minute

The time to ride the second biggest slide is given by:
\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we find the difference in time between the two slides:
\[
\text{Difference in time} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"Initially, Sheila charged $85.00 on her credit card. She returned an item costing $15.00, reducing her balance to:
\[ 85.00 - 15.00 = 70.00 \]

Next, she bought a frying pan on sale for 20% off $20.00:
\[ 20.00 \times (1 - 0.20) = 20.00 \times 0.80 = 16.00 \]

Then, she bought a set of towels on sale for 10% off $30.00:
\[ 30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00 \]

Adding the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to her new balance:
\[ 70.00 + 16.00 + 27.00 = 113.00 \]

Thus, the new balance on her credit card is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the total number of jellyfish in the tank as \( T \).

Given:
- A fifth of the jellyfish are large, so the number of large jellyfish is \( \frac{T}{5} \).
- A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light, which means \( \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{T}{5} = \frac{T}{15} \) jellyfish change color.
- When the UV light is turned on, 6 jellyfish change color. Therefore, we have the equation:
\[ \frac{T}{15} = 6 \]

To find \( T \), we solve the equation:
\[ T = 6 \times 15 \]
\[ T = 90 \]

Thus, the total number of jellyfish in the tank is \( 90 \).

\[

"To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work for her retirement plan, we need to consider her current salary, the percentage of her salary she saves, and her retirement plan details.

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual savings:**
   Lauren saves 20% of her annual salary.
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount Lauren needs for retirement:**
   Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary in retirement.
   \[
   \text{Annual living expenses in retirement} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
   \]
   Since she plans to save for 20 years, we need to find the total amount she needs to save over 20 years.
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \$40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save \$800,000:**
   We know Lauren saves \$20,000 per year. To find out how many years she needs to work to save \$800,000, we divide the total retirement savings needed by her annual savings.
   \[
   \text{Number of years needed} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for an additional 40 years to save enough for her retirement plan.

"To determine the total number of students in the school, we start with the information that 40% of the school population is 240 boys. We can express this relationship with the equation:

\[ 0.40 \times N = 240 \]

To find \( N \), the total number of students, we solve for \( N \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.40:

\[ N = \frac{240}{0.40} = \frac{240 \times 100}{40} = \frac{24000}{40} = 600 \]

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

Next, to find the number of girls, we note that 60% of the students are girls (since 100% - 40% = 60%). We calculate the number of girls as follows:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times N = 0.60 \times 600 = 360 \]

Therefore, the number of girls in the school is:

- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels, contributing a total of \(3 \times 2 = 6\) inches.

The combined total height of all the heels is:
\[ 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches} \]

There are a total of \(3 + 3 = 6\) women at the party. 

To find the average height of the heels, we divide the total height by the number of women:
\[ \text{Average height} = \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6} = 3 \text{ inches} \]

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the party is 3 inches."
"To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey on time, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in June:** June has 30 days.
2. **Determine the total number of miles Soledad plans to hike in June:** She plans to hike 9,300 miles.
3. **Calculate the number of miles Soledad plans to hike per day:** She plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time, so the total miles per day she plans to hike is \(125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day}\).
4. **Determine the required miles per day to complete the journey in 30 days:** To complete her journey in 30 days, she needs to hike \( \frac{9300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles/day}\).

"To determine how many kilograms of apples James will have left, we start by calculating the amounts each person wants:

Pierre wants a quarter of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[
\text{Pierre's share} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
\]

Paul wants one-third of the total 12 kg of apples:
\[
\text{Paul's share} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we find the total amount of apples that Pierre and Paul want together:
\[
\text{Total wanted by Pierre and Paul} = 3 \text{ kg} + 4 \text{ kg} = 7 \text{ kg}
\]

Given that the total amount of apples bought by Pierre, Paul, and Jacques is 12 kg, the amount of apples left for James is:
\[
\text{Apples left for James} = 12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}

- 4 male guppies
- 7 female guppies
- 3 male goldfishes
- 5 female goldfishes

After buying more fish, Tate has:
- 2 additional male guppies
- 1 additional female guppy
- 2 additional male goldfishes
- 3 additional female goldfishes

Adding these to the initial counts:
- Total male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
- Total female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
- Total male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
- Total female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Now, we calculate the total number of male and female fish:
- Total male fish: \(6 + 5 = 11\)
- Total female fish: \(8 + 8 = 16\)

To find out how many more female fish there are than male fish:

"To find the total time Amalia, Megan, and Dior took to do their chores, we start by calculating the time each person spent on their respective tasks:

1. **Amalia's chore:**
   - Mowing the lawn took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's chore:**
   - Walking the dog took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Therefore, Megan's time is \(4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Dior's chore:**
   - Doing laundry took her more than 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Dior's time is more than \(4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}\).
   - Let's assume Dior took 12 hours (a reasonable assumption given the problem's phrasing).

Now, we sum up the total time taken by all three:

\[
\text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 12 \text{ hours} = 22 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is:

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding that Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days. Therefore, the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days is calculated as follows:

\[ 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles} \]

Given that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, we can set up the equation:

\[ 70 \text{ miles} = 2 \times \text{Brian's distance} \]

To find Brian's distance, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \text{Brian's distance} = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles} \]

Thus, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we start by calculating the total number of toys produced by the first four workers during their 10-hour shift.

First, we calculate the production rate of the first two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 6 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 6 = 12\) toys per hour.

Next, we calculate the production rate of the next two workers:
- Each of these two workers produces 4 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(2 \times 4 = 8\) toys per hour.

Now, we find the total production rate of the first four workers:
- The first two workers produce 12 toys per hour.
- The next two workers produce 8 toys per hour.
- Therefore, together they produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

Since they all work for a 10-hour shift, the total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours is:
\[ 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys} \]

The toy manufacturer received an order for 400 toys, and by the end of their shift, they still need 20 toys to ship the order. Therefore, the number of toys produced by the first four workers is:
\[ 400 - 20 = 380 \text{ toys} \]

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys in 10 hours, the fifth worker must have produced:
\[ 380 - 200 = 180 \text{ toys} \]

To find out how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we divide the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours in the shift:
\[ \frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour} \]

Thus, the fifth worker produces \(\boxed{18}\) toys per hour."
"To find the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs, we start by calculating the weights of Elijah's dogs based on Kory's dog's weight, which is 60 pounds.

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds} \]

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
\[ \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds} \]

Adding the weights of Elijah's dogs together:
\[ \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs:
\[ \text{Total weight of both dogs} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is:
\[ \boxed{105} \]"
"To determine how many stickers Seth originally had, we work backwards from the information given:

"To determine the total number of M&Ms John has, we start by calculating the total weight in ounces. John buys 3 large bags, each weighing 10 ounces:

\[ 3 \text{ bags} \times 10 \text{ ounces per bag} = 30 \text{ ounces} \]

Next, we calculate the total number of M&Ms. Given that 1 ounce contains 30 M&Ms, the total number of M&Ms is:

\[ 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms} \]

Now, to find out how many small bags John can make if he puts 10 M&Ms in each small bag, we divide the total number of M&Ms by the number of M&Ms per small bag:

\[ \frac{900 \text{ M&Ms}}{10 \text{ M&Ms per small bag}} = 90 \text{ small bags} \]

Therefore, the number of small bags John can make is:

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of eggs painted by Arnold.
- Let \( M \) be the number of eggs painted by Madeline.
- Let \( C \) be the number of eggs painted by Camden.
- Let \( S \) be the number of eggs painted by Sarah.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs: \( A = M \).
2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs: \( C + S = 30 \).
3. Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah: \( C = S + 12 \).
4. The total number of eggs painted by all four is 56: \( A + M + C + S = 56 \).

Using the first piece of information, we can substitute \( M \) with \( A \) in the total eggs equation:
\[ A + A + C + S = 56 \]
\[ 2A + C + S = 56 \]

Next, we use the second and third pieces of information to express \( C \) and \( S \) in terms of \( S \):
\[ C = S + 12 \]
\[ C + S = 30 \]

Substitute \( C = S + 12 \) into \( C + S = 30 \):
\[ (S + 12) + S = 30 \]
\[ 2S + 12 = 30 \]
\[ 2S = 18 \]
\[ S = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( S = 9 \) back into \( C = S + 12 \):
\[ C = 9 + 12 \]
\[ C = 21 \]

We now have \( S = 9 \) and \( C = 21 \). Substitute these values into the equation \( 2A + C + S = 56 \):
\[ 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \]
\[ 2A + 30 = 56 \]
\[ 2A = 26 \]
\[ A = 13 \]

Since \( A = M \), we have \( M = 13 \).

To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold:
\[ C - A = 21 - 13 = 8 \]

Thus, Camden painted 8 more eggs than Arnold. The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"Nik has 200 crayons, and he wants to separate them into groups of 8 crayons each. This results in 25 groups. Each group of 8 crayons will be placed in a box, and each box weighs 8 ounces. The total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces (since each crayon weighs 1 ounce). Adding the weight of the boxes, which is 200 ounces, gives a total weight of 400 ounces. Converting this total weight into pounds, where 16 ounces equal 1 pound, we get:

\[ \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds} \]

Therefore, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds."
"John cuts down an 80-foot tree. He can make logs out of 80% of it, which means he can make logs from:

\[ 80 \text{ feet} \times 0.80 = 64 \text{ feet} \]

From these 64 feet, he cuts logs that are 4 feet each, so the number of logs he gets is:

\[ \frac{64 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/log}} = 16 \text{ logs} \]

Each of these logs is then cut into 5 planks, so the total number of planks is:

\[ 16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks/log} = 80 \text{ planks} \]

Each plank is sold for $1.2, so the total revenue from selling all the planks is:

\[ 80 \text{ planks} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/plank} = 96 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{96} \]"
"To find the total amount of money Valerie, her brother, and their mother have together, we start by determining the brother's salary. Given that Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is half of what her brother earns, we can calculate her brother's salary as follows:

\[ \text{Brother's salary} = 2 \times \text{Valerie's salary} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000 \]

Next, we calculate their combined salary:

\[ \text{Combined salary} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000 \]

Their mother earns twice their combined salary:

\[ \text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times \text{Combined salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000 \]

Finally, we find the total amount of money they all have together:

\[ \text{Total amount} = \text{Valerie's salary} + \text{Brother's salary} + \text{Mother's salary} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000 \]

Therefore, the total amount of money they all have together is $45000."
"To determine the total time it takes for Grandma to complete her 3-mile walk, we start by analyzing the given information. Grandma walks 3 miles in total, which includes 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. We know she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach, and her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach.

First, let's find her speed on the beach. Since she walks 2 miles in 40 minutes, her speed on the beach is:
\[ v_{\text{beach}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Next, her speed on the sidewalk is twice her speed on the beach:
\[ v_{\text{sidewalk}} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute} \]

Now, we calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:
\[ \text{Time on the sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we sum the time spent on both segments to find the total time for the 3-mile walk:
\[ \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes (beach)} + 10 \text{ minutes (sidewalk)} = 50 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk is:
\[ \boxed{50} \]"

- For the 2 trees with 4 blue birds each: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- For the 1 tree with 3 blue birds: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)

Adding these together: \(21 + 8 + 3 = 32\)

Therefore, the total number of blue birds in the trees is 32."
"To determine the initial number of marbles Bob has, we start with the information that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 2 dozen equals 24 marbles, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} + 24 = 60 \]

Solving for the initial number of marbles, we subtract 24 from 60:

\[ \text{Initial number of marbles} = 60 - 24 = 36 \]

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles. If Bob loses 10 of these marbles, we subtract 10 from 36:

\[ 36 - 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles is:

\[ \boxed{26} \]"

"To find the total number of animals on Melanie's farm after three weeks, we start with the initial count of animals and add the animals brought in over the period.

Initially, the farm has:
\[ 50 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ chickens} = 70 \text{ animals} \]

Next, we calculate the number of cows added over 21 days:
\[ 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows} \]

Then, we calculate the number of chickens added over 21 days:
\[ 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens} \]

Adding these to the initial count:
\[ 70 \text{ initial animals} + 420 \text{ cows added} + 210 \text{ chickens added} = 700 \text{ animals} \]

Thus, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:

"To determine how many potatoes Gomer ate, we start by identifying the number of scoops he consumed. The problem states that Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. This can be expressed as:

\[
23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many potatoes are required to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. We calculate 1 less than 3 as follows:

\[
3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops}
\]

Given that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, we calculate 3 less than 6 as:

\[
6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes}
\]

This means that 2 scoops of mashed potatoes require 3 potatoes. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we set up a proportion based on the given information:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{3 \times 18}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ potatoes}
\]

Therefore, Gomer ate 27 potatoes. The final numerical answer is:

"To find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we'll first calculate the total number of eggs he consumes over the 60 days.

1. **First 30 days:**
   Chester eats 3 eggs a day.
   \[
   3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

2. **Next 30 days:**
   Chester eats 5 eggs a day.
   \[
   5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

3. **Total eggs over 60 days:**
   \[
   90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs}

"To determine the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade, we start by calculating the number of lemons he collects from all his trees in one year. Given that Tim grows 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree annually, we can calculate the total lemons collected in one year as follows:

\[
\text{Total lemons per year} = \text{Number of trees} \times \text{Lemons per tree per year} = 5 \times 6 = 30
\]

Next, to find out how many lemons he collects in a decade, we multiply the total lemons collected in one year by the number of years in a decade. Since a decade consists of 10 years, we have:

\[
\text{Total lemons in a decade} = \text{Total lemons per year} \times 10 = 30 \times 10 = 300
\]

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is:

\[
\boxed{300}

"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given ratio of men to women, which is 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.

First, we need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio:
\[ 5 + 9 = 14 \]

Next, we use the total number of passengers to find out how many passengers each part of the ratio represents:
\[ \frac{84}{14} = 6 \]

Now, we can find the number of men and women:
- Number of men:
\[ 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
- Number of women:
\[ 9 \times 6 = 54 \]

After the next stop, 20 women alight from the bus. Therefore, the number of women remaining on the bus is:

"To determine the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days, we start by setting up a system of linear equations based on the given information.

Let \( s \) represent the number of sunflowers sold and \( b \) represent the number of bouquets sold per day.

From the problem, we know:
1. Each sunflower is sold for $2, and Faraday earns $26 from sunflowers per day.
2. Each bouquet is sold for $8 and contains 12 sunflowers, and Faraday earns $56 from bouquets per day.

We can write the following equations:
\[ 2s = 26 \]
\[ 8b = 56 \]
\[ 12b = s \]

First, solve for \( s \) from the first equation:
\[ s = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \]

Next, solve for \( b \) from the second equation:
\[ b = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \]

Now, verify the third equation with the values of \( s \) and \( b \):
\[ 12b = 12 \times 7 = 84 \]
\[ s = 13 \]

Since \( 12b = s \) holds true, the values are consistent. Now, calculate the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days:
\[ \text{Total sunflowers sold} = 3 \times s = 3 \times 13 = 39 \]

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is 39."

"To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we start by determining the probability of winning for each ticket. The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as a decimal: 0.20. The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so its probability of winning is:

\[ P(\text{Winning second ticket}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60 \]

Since the events are independent, the probability that both tickets are winners is the product of their individual probabilities:

\[ P(\text{Both tickets are winners}) = P(\text{Winning first ticket}) \times P(\text{Winning second ticket}) \]
\[ P(\text{Both tickets are winners}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the information provided:

1. Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. This gives us the equation:
\[ J = C + 5 \]
Since \( J = 27 \), we substitute to find \( C \):
\[ 27 = C + 5 \]
\[ C = 22 \]

2. Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. This gives us the equation:
\[ C = 2R \]
Since \( C = 22 \), we substitute to find \( R \):
\[ 22 = 2R \]
\[ R = 11 \]

Now, we know the total number of seashells collected by Carlos, Jim, and Carrey is:
\[ C + J + R = 22 + 27 + 11 = 60 \]

They divided the seashells equally among themselves, so each person got:
\[ \frac{60}{3} = 20 \]

Thus, each person got 20 seashells. The final numerical answer is:

"To determine how many more bottles of juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people:**
   - Each person's daily energy demand is covered by 20% of a bottle of juice.
   - Therefore, 100% of a person's daily energy demand is covered by 5 bottles of juice (since 100% / 20% = 5).

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people:**
   - Each person needs 5 bottles.
   - For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:

"To determine the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we start by calculating the number of babies dressed in purple and blue:

- Total number of babies = 8
- Number of babies dressed in purple = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \)
- Number of babies dressed in blue = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \)

Next, we calculate the number of babies who wear bows:
- Number of babies wearing bows among the blue-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 2 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \) (rounding to the nearest whole number, 1 baby)
- Number of babies wearing bows among the purple-wearers = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \)

So, the total number of babies wearing bows is:
\[ 1 + 2 = 3 \]

Now, we find the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) \times 100 \approx 66.67\% \]

"To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we start with the total number of reports received last week, which is 5168. We then subtract the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday (1907) and the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday (2136).

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136) \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 \]

\[ \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 1125 \]

The number of reports received on Wednesday is 1125."
"To determine how much money Abraham will earn after selling all his unused land, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Land Area:**
   Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land.

2. **First Sale:**
   He sold half of his land for $50.
   \[
   \text{Area sold in the first sale} = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   The price per square meter for the first sale is:
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

3. **Second Sale:**
   After a month, he sold another 1/4 of his land for $30.
   \[
   \text{Area sold in the second sale} = \frac{80}{4} = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   The price per square meter for the second sale is:
   \[
   \text{Price per square meter} = \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per square meter}
   \]

4. **Remaining Land:**
   After the first and second sales, the remaining land is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining area} = 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ square meters}
   \]
   Abraham sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter.
   \[
   \text{Revenue from remaining land} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Total Revenue:**
   Summing up the revenue from all sales:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 50 + 30 + 60 = 140 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land is:
\[
\boxed{140}
\]"
"To find Geb's age, we start with the relationship given in the problem: Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. Given that Haley is 26 years old, we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ G = \frac{1}{2}H - 10 \]

Substituting Haley's age (\( H = 26 \)) into the equation:

\[ G = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 - 10 \]

First, calculate half of Haley's age:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \]

Then, subtract 10 from this value:

\[ 13 - 10 = 3 \]

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 3 \]"
"To find out how many face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we start by calculating the number of face masks he uses per outing. Since he changes his face mask two times every time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day, we can calculate the daily usage as follows:

1. **Daily Face Masks Calculation:**
   - Face masks per outing: 2
   - Outings per day: 3
   - Daily face masks: \(2 \times 3 = 6\)

Next, to find the total for 2 days, we multiply the daily usage by 2:

2. **2 Days Face Masks Calculation:**
   - Daily face masks: 6
   - Days: 2
   - Total face masks for 2 days: \(6 \times 2 = 12\)

Therefore, Tyrion uses \(\boxed{12}\) face masks every 2 days."
"Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which totals 36 eggs. Lamar found 5 eggs, Stacy found twice as many as Lamar (which is 10 eggs), Charlie found 2 less than Stacy (which is 8 eggs), and Mei found half as many as Charlie (which is 4 eggs). Adding the eggs found by each person, we get:

\[ 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs} \]

Subtracting the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:

\[ 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs} \]

Therefore, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is 9."

Therefore, the amount of money John makes in a week is \(\boxed{1248}\) dollars."
"To determine the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life, we will analyze the production pattern year by year.

1. **5-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 50 fruits.

2. **6-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(3 \times 50 = 150\) fruits.

3. **7-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(7 \times 50 = 350\) fruits.

4. **8-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(10 \times 50 - 200 = 500 - 200 = 300\) fruits.

5. **9-year-old tree:**
   - Produces 0 fruits.

6. **10-year-old tree:**
   - Produces \(20 \times 50 = 1000\) fruits.

Now, we sum the fruits produced each year:

\[
50 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 0 + 1000 = 1850
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits an avocado tree can produce during its 10 years of life is \(\boxed{1850}\)."
"To determine how much money Jack has now, we start by calculating the amount given to him by Sophia. Since Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100, we calculate:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
\]

Jack originally had $100. Adding the $20 given to him by Sophia, we get:

\[

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the given information:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \( R = 4B \).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \( B = Y - 7 \).
3. The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters: \( R + B + Y = 37 \).

First, we substitute \( B = Y - 7 \) into the equation \( R + B + Y = 37 \):
\[ R + (Y - 7) + Y = 37 \]
\[ R + 2Y - 7 = 37 \]
\[ R + 2Y = 44 \]

Next, we substitute \( R = 4B \) into the equation \( R + 2Y = 44 \):
\[ 4B + 2Y = 44 \]

Since \( B = Y - 7 \), we substitute \( B \) in the equation:
\[ 4(Y - 7) + 2Y = 44 \]
\[ 4Y - 28 + 2Y = 44 \]
\[ 6Y - 28 = 44 \]
\[ 6Y = 72 \]
\[ Y = 12 \]

Now, we find \( B \) and \( R \):
\[ B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \]
\[ R = 4B = 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Therefore, the length of the red rope is \( 20 \) centimeters. The final answer is:

"Ronnie was given $5, and Rissa was given three times that amount, which totals to $15. After each of them gave an equal amount of money, say \( x \), to their little sister, Rissa is left with \(\frac{4}{5}\) of her money. This means:

\[ 15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 \]
\[ 15 - x = 12 \]
\[ x = 3 \]

Therefore, Ronnie, who initially had $5, will have:

\[ 5 - 3 = 2 \]

So, the amount left in Ronnie's money is $2. The correct answer is:

\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"Given the mural uses 12 pints of paint in total, and it is divided such that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and half the mural is yellow, we can deduce the distribution of the paint.

Since half the mural is yellow, the other half must be equally divided among red, white, and purple. Therefore, the amount of red paint, white paint, and purple paint combined is half of the total paint used, which is:
\[ \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints} \]

Given that the red, white, and purple paints are equal in amount, we can denote the amount of red paint as \( R \), white paint as \( W \), and purple paint as \( P \). Thus:
\[ R = W = P \]

The total amount of red, white, and purple paint is:
\[ R + W + P = 6 \text{ pints} \]
\[ R + R + R = 6 \text{ pints} \]
\[ 3R = 6 \text{ pints} \]
\[ R = 2 \text{ pints} \]

Therefore, the number of pints of red paint used is:
\[ \boxed{2} \]"
"To find the total area of Tom's house, we need to calculate the area of the bedrooms, the living room, and the remaining area of the house.

1. **Calculate the area of one bedroom:**

   \text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ feet} = 240 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total area of the 4 bedrooms:**
   \[
   \text{Total area of 4 bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 960 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the living room:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the living room} = 5 \times \text{Area of one bedroom} = 5 \times 240 \text{ square feet} = 1200 \text{ square feet}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total area of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = \text{Total area of 4 bedrooms} + \text{Area of the living room} + \text{Remaining area}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total area of the house} = 960 \text{ square feet} + 1200 \text{ square feet} + 1000 \text{ square feet} = 3160 \text{ square feet}

The total area of the house is \(3160\) square feet."
"To solve the problem using the concept of geometric sequences, we start by identifying the first term and the common ratio. The first term \(a_1\) is 3, and the common ratio \(r\) is 2, since each day the number of puffs doubles.

The number of puffs of clouds Alice counts each day forms a geometric sequence where:
- The first term \(a_1 = 3\)
- The common ratio \(r = 2\)

The number of puffs on each day can be calculated as follows:
- Monday: \(a_1 = 3\)
- Tuesday: \(a_2 = a_1 \times r = 3 \times 2 = 6\)
- Wednesday: \(a_3 = a_2 \times r = 6 \times 2 = 12\)
- Thursday: \(a_4 = a_3 \times r = 12 \times 2 = 24\)
- Friday: \(a_5 = a_4 \times r = 24 \times 2 = 48\)

To find the total number of puffs counted from Monday to Friday, we sum the terms of the geometric sequence:
\[
S_n = a_1 \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
\]
where \(n = 5\) (the number of days from Monday to Friday).

Substituting the values:
\[
S_5 = 3 \frac{2^5 - 1}{2 - 1} = 3 \frac{32 - 1}{1} = 3 \times 31 = 93
\]

Thus, the total number of puffs of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:
\[
\boxed{93}

"To find out how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 with the new box, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the new box:**
   - The original box has 100 pods.
   - The new box has 20% more pods than the original box.
   - Calculate 20% of 100 pods: \( 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \) pods.
   - Add this to the original number of pods: \( 100 + 20 = 120 \) pods.

2. **Determine the cost per pod:**
   - The new box costs $12 for 120 pods.
   - Cost per pod: \( \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \) dollars per pod.

3. **Calculate the number of cycles that can be run for $1:**
   - Each cycle uses 1 pod.
   - Cost per cycle: $0.10.
   - Number of cycles for $1: \( \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \) cycles.

Therefore, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 with the new box is 10.

**Final Answer: 10**"
"Thomas initially withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. This means he withdraws:

\[
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
\]

He loses 10 bills on the way home, leaving him with:

\[
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
\]

He then uses half of these remaining bills to pay for a bill, which means he uses:

\[
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

So, the number of bills he has left is:

\[
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
\]

After tripling his money, he has:

\[
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
\]

When he converts this amount to $5 bills, the number of $5 bills he has is:

\[
\frac{400}{5} = 80 \text{ bills}
\]

Therefore, the final number of $5 bills Thomas has is:

\[
\boxed{80}

"To find the total number of goals scored in the match, we will break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Half Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals.
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals.

2. **Second Half Goals:**
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, in the second half, Team B scores \(4 \times 2 = 8\) goals.
   - Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, Team A scores \(\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2\) goals.

3. **Total Goals Scored:**
   - Team A's total goals: \(4 \text{ (first half)} + 2 \text{ (second half)} = 6\).
   - Team B's total goals: \(2 \text{ (first half)} + 8 \text{ (second half)} = 10\).
   - The total number of goals scored in the match is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

The total number of goals scored in the match is \(\boxed{16}\)."
"To determine how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the piece of chalk, we need to follow the usage pattern and recycling condition step by step.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk on Monday.

2. **Chalk Usage on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day. So, the chalk used on Monday is:
   \[
   0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}

"To determine how many students are not on varsity, we start by calculating the number of girls and boys who are on varsity.

- One-third of the 12 girls are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity} \]

- One-fourth of the 12 boys are on varsity:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity} \]

Next, we find the number of girls and boys who are not on varsity.

- Number of girls not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ girls not on varsity} \]

- Number of boys not on varsity:
\[ 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ boys not on varsity} \]

Adding these together gives the total number of students not on varsity:
\[ 8 + 9 = 17 \]

Therefore, the number of students not on varsity is \(\boxed{17}\)."

"To determine the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of teeth drilled and capped:**
   - The dentist drills 4 teeth.
   - The dentist caps 7 more teeth than he drills, which means he caps \(4 + 7 = 11\) teeth.

2. **Calculate the total number of teeth fixed:**
   - The total number of teeth fixed is the sum of the teeth drilled and the teeth capped, which is \(4 + 11 = 15\) teeth.

3. **Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed:**
   - The percentage of teeth fixed is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of teeth fixed}}{\text{Total number of teeth}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     \text{Percentage fixed} = \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
     \]

Therefore, the percentage of James' teeth that the dentist fixes is \(50\%\).

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

"To calculate the refund amount, we start by determining the total cost of the milk Mr. Marcellus initially purchased. The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at $3.5 per gallon, so the total cost is:

\[ 4000 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 14000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, we need to find out how much milk passed the expiry date. Mr. Marcellus returned 2/5 of the milk he purchased. The amount of milk returned is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \]

The refund amount is the cost of the 1600 gallons of milk that was returned. Since the cost per gallon is $3.5, the refund amount is:

\[ 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 5600 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount Mr. Marcellus received in refunds is:

\[
\boxed{5600}

"To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

First, we substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7)) \]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ C + 25 = \frac{5(C + 7)}{3} \]

Multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:

\[ 3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7) \]

Expand both sides:

\[ 3C + 75 = 5C + 35 \]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):

\[ 75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \]
\[ 40 = 2C \]
\[ C = 20 \]

Thus, Colin's current age is \( 20 \).

"Bob spends $27,000 to buy books for 3 schools. He can buy 100 books for $500. To find out how many books he can buy per school, we first determine the total number of books he can buy with $27,000.

\[ \text{Number of books per school} = \frac{27000}{500} \times 100 \div 3 \]

First, calculate the number of books he can buy with $27,000:

\[ \frac{27000}{500} = 54 \]

Then, multiply by 100 to find the total number of books:

\[ 54 \times 100 = 5400 \]

Finally, divide the total number of books by 3 to find out how many books each school gets:

\[ \frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \]

Therefore, Bob can buy 1800 books per school. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 1800 \]"
"Let's break down the sequence of events step by step to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial apples**: Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 2

2. **First interaction**:
   - Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other apple into the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 1 (remaining apple)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 1 (pocketed apple) + 1 (thrown apple) = 2

3. **Second interaction**:
   - Newton picked up the remaining apple, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
   - Apples on the ground: 0 (all apples thrown)
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 2 (pocketed apples) + 1 (thrown apple) = 3

4. **Third interaction**:
   - Newton picked up all the remaining apples (6 more apples fell out of the tree).
   - Apples in Newton's pocket: 3 (pocketed apples) + 6 (picked up apples) = 9

Therefore, Newton brought home 9 apples.

The final numerical answer is:
9"
"To find the total cost of Ali's order, we start by determining the number of 50 kg bags in 850 kg of coal:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{850 \text{ kg}}{50 \text{ kg/bag}} = 17 \text{ bags}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of bags by the cost per bag:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 17 \text{ bags} \times 18 \text{ dollars/bag} = 306 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of Ali's order is **306 dollars**."
"To determine the number of pizzas Kate needs to buy, we'll start by calculating the total slices consumed by her 6 friends.

For the cheese pizza:
- Each friend eats 6 slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Therefore, the total slices of cheese pizza consumed is \(6 \times 6 = 36\) slices.
- Since each cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, the number of cheese pizzas needed is \(\frac{36}{12} = 3\) pizzas.

For the pepperoni pizza:
- Each friend eats 4 slices.
- There are 6 friends.
- Therefore, the total slices of pepperoni pizza consumed is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) slices.
- Since each pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, the number of pepperoni pizzas needed is \(\frac{24}{8} = 3\) pizzas.

Adding the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas together:
- Cheese pizzas needed: 3
- Pepperoni pizzas needed: 3
- Total pizzas needed: \(3 + 3 = 6\)

Therefore, Kate needs to buy \(\boxed{6}\) pizzas."
"To calculate the total miles Sam ran this week, we add the miles run on the days with different distances:

- For Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. So, the total for these three days is:
  \[
  3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}
  \]

- For Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. So, the total for these two days is:
  \[
  5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}
  \]

Adding these totals together:
\[
9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, the total number of miles Sam ran this week is:
\[
\boxed{19}

"To determine how long it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to account for his production rate and the rate at which the snowballs melt.

1. **Rate of Snowball Production:**
   Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.

2. **Rate of Snowball Melt:**
   2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes. 
   - In one hour (60 minutes), the number of 15-minute intervals is:
     \[
     \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 4 \text{ intervals}
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of snowballs that melt in one hour is:
     \[
     2 \text{ snowballs/interval} \times 4 \text{ intervals} = 8 \text{ snowballs}
     \]

3. **Net Snowball Production per Hour:**
   The net number of snowballs Jay produces in one hour is:
   \[
   20 \text{ snowballs} - 8 \text{ snowballs} = 12 \text{ snowballs}
   \]

4. **Time to Reach 60 Snowballs:**
   To find out how many hours it takes to produce 60 snowballs, we divide the total number of snowballs needed by the net production rate:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ snowballs}}{12 \text{ snowballs/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, it will take Jay \(\boxed{5}\) hours to have 60 snowballs."
"Given that John is currently 28 years old and he was twice as old as Jim when the show came out, we can deduce Jim's age at that time. If John's age at that time was \(2J\), and we know John's current age is 28, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2J = 28 \]

Solving for \(J\):

\[ J = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

Therefore, Jim was 14 years old when the show came out. Since no additional time has passed, Jim is still 14 years old.

The final numerical answer is:

14"
"Doxa sliced the apple into 8 pieces. She ate 1 slice, her sister ate 1 more than her, and her brother ate 1 more than her sister. To find out how many slices of apple they all ate, we can calculate as follows:

- Doxa ate 1 slice.
- Her sister ate \(1 + 1 = 2\) slices.
- Her brother ate \(2 + 1 = 3\) slices.

Adding these together, the total number of slices eaten is \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).

Therefore, the total number of slices of apple they all ate is 6."
"To determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Day:**
   - They used 38 bandages.
   - They ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
   - After using 38 bandages, they had \(50 - 38 = 12\) bandages left.
   - They ordered 50 more bandages, so they now have \(12 + 50 = 62\) bandages.

2. **Second Day:**
   - They used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, so they used \(38 - 10 = 28\) bandages.
   - After using 28 bandages, they had \(62 - 28 = 34\) bandages left.
   - They used 28 bandages, so they now have \(34 - 28 = 6\) bandages left.

3. **Third Day:**
   - They ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so they ordered \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages.
   - They used half a pack, which is \(50 / 2 = 25\) bandages.
   - After using 25 bandages, they had \(6 + 100 - 25 = 81\) bandages left.
   - They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, so they must have used \(81 - 78 = 3\) bandages more than they needed to reach 78 bandages.

Since they had 81 bandages after ordering and using 25, and they ended up with 78, it means they used 3 more bandages than necessary. This confirms the calculations.

Therefore, the number of bandages they started with on the first day is 62.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{62}

"To determine Jen's total earnings for April, we need to calculate her weekly earnings and then sum them up for the month.

First, let's calculate her daily earnings:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.

Daily earnings = 7.5 hours/day * $1.5/hour = $11.25/day

Next, let's calculate her weekly earnings:
- Jen works 6 days a week.

Weekly earnings = $11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.50/week

Since there are exactly 4 weeks in April, we calculate her total earnings for the month:
- Total earnings for April = $67.50/week * 4 weeks = $270.00

Additionally, Jen receives an extra $10 for complete attendance each week. Since she did not incur any absences for April, she will receive this bonus for 4 weeks:
- Total attendance bonus for April = $10/week * 4 weeks = $40.00

Finally, we add her total earnings for the month and her total attendance bonus:
- Total amount Jen will receive = $270.00 + $40.00 = $310.00

The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{310}

"To calculate Jason's earnings, we'll add up the earnings from each task he completed over the two-week period.

1. **Earnings from doing laundry:**
   Jason earns $3.00 for doing his laundry once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from laundry} = 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
   \]

2. **Earnings from cleaning his room:**
   Jason earns $1.50 for cleaning his room once.
   \[
   \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} = 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Earnings from taking the trash out:**
   Jason earns $0.75 for taking the trash out each week. Since he took the trash out twice in the two-week period:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from taking the trash out} = 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Earnings from emptying the dishwasher:**
   Jason earns $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher each time. Since he emptied the dishwasher 6 times:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher} = 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
   \]

Now, we sum up all the earnings:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00 = 9.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Jason earned is:
\[
\boxed{9.00}

"To find the total amount of blood in ten sharks, we start by calculating the blood volume of one shark. Given that a whale has 40 gallons of blood and a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, we calculate the blood volume of one shark as follows:

\[ \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons} \]

Next, to find the total blood volume for ten sharks, we multiply the blood volume of one shark by ten:

\[ \text{Total blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons} \]

Therefore, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

\[ \boxed{1200} \]"
"To find the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day, we will add the entries step by step.

1. **Morning Entry:**
   - 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.

2. **Entry at 10:00:**
   - 40 more people entered the restaurant at 10:00.
   - These 40 people ordered the same amount of food as the first 50 people.

3. **Additional Entry:**
   - Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in later.
   - Number of people who came in later = \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

4. **Evening Entry:**
   - An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.
   - Number of people who came in evening = \(3 \times 50 = 150\).

Now, we sum up all the entries:

- Morning entry: 50 people
- Entry at 10:00: 40 people
- Additional entry: 80 people
- Evening entry: 150 people

Total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day:

"To find the total number of pens Alain has, we start by calculating the number of red pens. Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, and each pack contains 5 pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:

\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 25 \text{ red pens} \]

Next, we calculate the number of black pens. The problem states that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens as red pens. Since there are 25 red pens, the number of packs of black pens is:

\[ 2 \times 5 \text{ packs} = 10 \text{ packs} \]

Each pack of black pens contains 5 pens, so the total number of black pens is:

\[ 10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens/pack} = 50 \text{ black pens} \]

Adding the number of red pens and black pens together gives the total number of pens:

\[ 25 \text{ red pens} + 50 \text{ black pens} = 75 \text{ pens} \]

Therefore, the total number of pens Alain has is:

\[ 75 \]"
"John buys 10 bottles of scotch for a total cost of $600. Each bottle of scotch costs:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of scotch} = \frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he buys:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
\]

The cost per bottle of cognac is 50% more than the cost of a bottle of scotch. Therefore, the cost per bottle of cognac is:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of cognac} = 60 \times 1.5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

The total cost for the cognac is:

\[
\text{Total cost of cognac} = 20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

Adding the total cost of the scotch and the total cost of the cognac gives:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final numerical answer is:

\[

"To determine the total number of trees Mr. Julius planted over the two days, we will calculate the number of trees planted each day and then sum them up.

1. **First Day Planting:**
   - Mr. Julius planted 20 White Oak trees.
   - He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which means:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ Lodgepole Pine trees}
     \]

2. **Second Day Planting:**
   - On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, which means:
     \[
     20 + 10 = 30 \text{ White Oak trees}
     \]
   - On the second day, he planted \(\frac{1}{4}\) more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, which means:
     \[
     40 + \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 40 + 10 = 50 \text{ Lodgepole Pine trees}
     \]

3. **Total Trees Planted:**
   - The total number of White Oak trees planted over the two days is:
     \[
     20 \text{ (first day)} + 30 \text{ (second day)} = 50
     \]
   - The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted over the two days is:
     \[
     40 \text{ (first day)} + 50 \text{ (second day)} = 90
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is:
     \[
     50 \text{ (White Oak)} + 90 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 140

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes, and then find the total number of fish that have either red or blue stripes.

1. **Calculate the number of fish with red stripes:**
   - There are 66 fish in total.
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining fish after accounting for the fish with red stripes:**
   - Total number of fish = 66
   - Number of fish with red stripes = 22
   \[
   \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.
   \[
   \text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes:**
   - Number of fish with red stripes = 22
   - Number of fish with blue stripes = 20

"To determine the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left, we start with the initial total:

- Two eyeshadow palettes, each with 4 colors: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) colors
- Three makeup sets, each with 6 colors: \(3 \times 6 = 18\) colors

Adding these together gives the initial total number of eyeshadow colors:
\[8 + 18 = 26\]

When her sister steals one of the palettes, which contains 4 colors, the number of colors left is:
\[26 - 4 = 22\]

Amy then uses up half of the colors from one of the makeup sets. Since each makeup set has 6 colors, half of the colors from one makeup set is:
\[\frac{6}{2} = 3\]

Subtracting these used colors from the remaining total gives:
\[22 - 3 = 19\]

Therefore, the number of eyeshadow colors Amy has left is:
\[
\boxed{19}

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 1 + 4 + 3 + x = 3 \times 4 \]
\[ 8 + x = 12 \]
\[ x = 12 - 8 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Therefore, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles. The correct answer is 4 miles."
"John decides to get a loan by mortgaging his home, which is worth $250,000. He gets a loan worth 40% of that value. To find the loan amount, we calculate:

\[
\text{Loan amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

Next, John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. To find out how much he uses to pay off his debts, we calculate:

\[
\text{Amount used to pay off debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

To find out how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the loan amount:

\[
\text{Money leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000

"To find out how much Deandre will earn from selling all the tunas, we first need to calculate the total weight of the tunas he caught. The weights of the tunas are 56 kilograms, 46 kilograms, and 26 kilograms. Adding these weights together gives:

\[ 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kilograms} \]

Next, we calculate the total earnings by multiplying the total weight by the price per kilogram. Since each kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, the total earnings are:

\[ 128 \text{ kilograms} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars per kilogram} = 64 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, Deandre will earn \(\boxed{64}\) dollars."
"To determine Trinity's profit, we need to calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost price from it.

1. **Calculate the selling price:**
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them. The cost price of the magazines is $72.

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{11 \times 9}{1} = 99
   \]

   So, the selling price is $99.

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
   \]

   Substitute the values:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27
   \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

The final numerical answer is \(\boxed{27}\)."

"To find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we start by calculating the amount of medicine in one dose. 

1. **Calculate the amount of the second medicine in one dose:**
   - The first medicine amount is 14 mL.
   - The second medicine amount is 3 times the first medicine amount.
   - Therefore, the second medicine amount is \( 3 \times 14 \) mL.

\[
3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL}
\]

2. **Calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose:**
   - The total amount of medicine in one dose is the sum of the first and second medicine amounts.
   - Therefore, the total amount is \( 14 \text{ mL} + 42 \text{ mL} \).

\[
14 + 42 = 56 \text{ mL}
\]

3. **Calculate the total amount of medicine in 8 doses:**
   - The total amount of medicine in 8 doses is 8 times the amount in one dose.
   - Therefore, the total amount is \( 8 \times 56 \text{ mL} \).

\[
8 \times 56 = 448 \text{ mL}
\]

Thus, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses is \(\boxed{448}\) mL."
"To find the combined capacity of both schools, we start by determining the capacity of Ali's class, which is given as 120 students.

Next, we calculate the capacity of one of John's classes, which is \( \frac{1}{8} \) of Ali's class capacity:
\[
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
\]

Since John has two classes, the total capacity of John's classes is:
\[
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
\]

Adding the capacities of Ali's class and John's classes gives us the combined capacity:
\[
\text{Combined capacity} = 120 + 30 = 150 \text{ students}
\]

Therefore, the combined capacity of both schools is:

"To determine how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Stephen will return, which includes the principal plus the interest.
2. Determine the total amount Stephen will pay over the first 11 months.
3. Subtract the amount paid over the first 11 months from the total amount to find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Stephen will return.**

Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with an additional 2% interest. The interest amount is:
\[ 300 \times 0.02 = 6 \]
So, the total amount Stephen will return is:
\[ 300 + 6 = 306 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total amount Stephen will pay over the first 11 months.**

Stephen will pay $25 per month for the first 11 months. The total amount paid over these 11 months is:
\[ 25 \times 11 = 275 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month.**

The amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is the total amount he will return minus the amount he has already paid over the first 11 months:
\[ 306 - 275 = 31 \]

So, the amount Stephen will pay in the twelfth month is:
\[ \boxed{31} \]"

"To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables. Let \( x \) represent the length of the shorter piece in feet. Consequently, the longer piece will be \( 4x \) feet, as it is 4 times the length of the shorter piece.

Given that the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the following equation to represent the total length:

\[ x + 4x = 40 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 5x = 40 \]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[ x = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \]

Thus, the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet. The length of the longer piece, which is 4 times the shorter piece, is:

\[ 4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 32 feet.

The final numerical answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the equations based on the information provided. Let \( C \) represent the number of cupcakes and \( B \) represent the number of brownies. According to the problem, we have:

1. \( B = 3C - 2 \) (Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes)
2. \( C + B = 10 \) (The total number of treats is 10, with each of the 5 people getting 2 treats)

Substituting the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation, we get:
\[ C + (3C - 2) = 10 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 4C - 2 = 10 \]
\[ 4C = 12 \]
\[ C = 3 \]

Thus, Carly made 3 cupcakes. To verify, if \( C = 3 \), then:
\[ B = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7 \]
\[ C + B = 3 + 7 = 10 \]

This confirms that the total number of treats is indeed 10. Therefore, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:
\[ \boxed{3} \]"
"To determine the total cost for Karen, we start by calculating the combined cost of a basic manicure and a basic pedicure without any discounts:

- Cost of a basic manicure: $35
- Cost of a basic pedicure: $40

Adding these together gives:

\[
35 + 40 = 75
\]

Next, the salon offers a 20% discount for getting both services. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $75:

\[
0.20 \times 75 = 15
\]

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives:

\[
75 - 15 = 60
\]

Karen also wants to add nail art on each of her fingers. There are 10 fingers in total, and each nail art service costs $3:

\[
10 \times 3 = 30

"To determine the final price of the toy after the price changes in November, December, and January, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the price in December:**
   - The original price in November is $40.
   - The price increased by 80% in December.
   - To find the increase, we calculate 80% of $40:
     \[
     0.80 \times 40 = 32
     \]
   - Adding this increase to the original price:
     \[
     40 + 32 = 72
     \]
   - Therefore, the price in December is $72.

2. **Calculate the price in January:**
   - The price in December is $72.
   - The price decreased by 50% in January.
   - To find the decrease, we calculate 50% of $72:
     \[
     0.50 \times 72 = 36
     \]
   - Subtracting this decrease from the December price:
     \[

"To determine the total number of grapes at the beginning, we'll follow the sequence of events step by step.

1. **Grapes eaten by Madeline:**
   Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Grapes used by her brother:**
   Her brother used up 5 times as many grapes as Madeline. Therefore, the number of grapes used by her brother is:
   \[
   5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
   \]

3. **Grapes remaining after her brother:**
   The total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother is:
   \[
   6 + 30 = 36 \text{ grapes}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of grapes remaining is:
   \[
   \text{Total grapes at the beginning} - 36 = \text{Remaining grapes}
   \]

4. **Grapes used to make pies:**
   Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes. Therefore, the total number of grapes used to make the pies is:
   \[
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
   \]

5. **Total grapes at the beginning:**
   Since the remaining grapes after her brother used his share are used to make the pies, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total grapes at the beginning} - 36 = 48
   \]
   Solving for the total number of grapes at the beginning:

"To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we start by calculating the weekly cost of ingredients. Bud spends $1.00 on pasta, $3.00 on cheddar cheese, and $6.00 on gruyere cheese. Adding these amounts together gives us the weekly cost:

\[
1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
\]

Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the weekly cost is $10.00. To find the annual cost, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year, which is 52:

\[
10.00 \times 52 = 520.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year is:

\[
\boxed{520.00}

"To determine the percentage of their day that the custodian spends cleaning classrooms, we start by calculating the total time required to clean all 80 classrooms. Given that it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total cleaning time is:

\[ 80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we convert the total cleaning time into hours since the workday is given in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[ 1200 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

The custodian works 8 hours per day. To find out what percentage of their 8-hour workday is spent cleaning classrooms, we use the formula for percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{20 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100 = 2.5 \times 100 = 250\% \]

Therefore, on average, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms. This result indicates that the custodian spends more than one full workday cleaning the classrooms in the given 5 days.

The final numerical answer is:

"To determine the number of bookcases Elly needs, we start by calculating the total capacity of one bookcase. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so together they can hold \(10 + 10 = 20\) books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, which is \(20 - 5 = 15\) books. Adding these capacities together, the total capacity of one bookcase is \(20 + 20 + 15 = 55\) books.

Given that Elly has 110 books, we need to find out how many bookcases are required to hold all of her books. This is calculated by dividing the total number of books by the capacity of one bookcase: \(\frac{110}{55} = 2\).

Next, we calculate the total number of eggs Rose has, which is:

\[ 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ eggs} \]

Rose sells the eggs at $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how many sets of 3 eggs she has, we divide the total number of eggs by 3:

\[ 60 \div 3 = 20 \text{ sets} \]

Since each set of 3 eggs is sold for $1, the total selling price is:

\[ 20 \times 1 = 20 \text{ dollars} \]

Finally, to find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the total selling price:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Rose's profit is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To determine the number of white hats Skyler has, we can follow these steps:

1. **Total number of hats**: Skyler has 100 hats in total.

2. **Number of red hats**: Half of the hats are red.
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining hats after removing red hats**: Subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats.
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Number of blue hats**: 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **Number of white hats**: Subtract the number of blue hats from the remaining hats.
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is:

"To determine the cost per stick of beef jerky in cents, we start by calculating the discounted price of the bag. The original price is $18.00, and with a $3.00 discount, the price becomes $15.00. Since the bag contains 30 sticks, we divide the discounted price by the number of sticks to find the cost per stick in dollars:

\[ \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick} \]

Next, we convert this cost into cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we multiply the cost per stick in dollars by 100:

\[ 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents per stick} \]

Therefore, the cost per stick of jerky in cents is:

\[ \boxed{50} \]"
"To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test, we start by calculating the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test. The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct:

\[ 70 \times 0.60 = 42 \]

So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test. The total number of questions on both tests is:

\[ 70 + 40 = 110 \]

To pass, Audrey needs to answer 70% of these 110 questions correctly:

\[ 110 \times 0.70 = 77 \]

Since she has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:

\[ 77 - 42 = 35 \]

Therefore, Audrey needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{35} \]"
"To find the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes, we start with the equation for the total number of ice cubes:

\[ S + B = 116 \]

Given that the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes \( S \) minus 4, we can express \( B \) as:

\[ B = 5S - 4 \]

Substituting \( B \) in the total equation:

\[ S + (5S - 4) = 116 \]

Simplifying this equation:

\[ 6S - 4 = 116 \]

Adding 4 to both sides:

\[ 6S = 120 \]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[ S = 20 \]

Now, substituting \( S = 20 \) back into the equation for \( B \):

\[ B = 5(20) - 4 \]
\[ B = 100 - 4 \]
\[ B = 96 \]

Therefore, the number of blueberry cubes Mary makes is 96."

"To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars, we can break down the problem into a series of steps involving ratios and proportions.

1. **Determine the number of customers needed to sell 15 cars:**
   - For every 2 cars sold, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to sell 15 cars, the number of customers needed is:
     \[
     \frac{15 \text{ cars}}{2 \text{ cars/customer}} = 7.5 \text{ customers}
     \]
   - Since Jason can't have half a customer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 8 customers.

2. **Determine the number of telephone calls needed to get 8 customers:**
   - For every 25 telephone calls, 1 customer comes to the dealership.
   - Therefore, to get 8 customers, the number of telephone calls needed is:
     \[
     8 \text{ customers} \times 25 \text{ calls/customer} = 200 \text{ calls}
     \]

     \]

2. **Number of Candles:**
   - There are 8 rooms in the house.
   - Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each.
   - The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each.
   - Half of 8 rooms is:
     \[
     \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ rooms}
     \]
   - For the 4 rooms with 4 small candles each:
     \[
     4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ candles per room} = 16 \text{ small candles}
     \]
   - For the 4 rooms with 5 medium candles each:
     \[
     4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ candles per room} = 20 \text{ medium candles}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of candles is:
     \[
     16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles}
     \]

3. **Total Number of Candles and Flashlights:**
   - Total number of flashlights: 8
   - Total number of candles: 36
   - Therefore, the total number of candles and flashlights is:

"To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we will calculate the depreciation year by year starting from the initial value of $9000.

1. **First Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after first year} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
   \]

2. **Second Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the second year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the first year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after second year} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
   \]

3. **Third Year Depreciation:**
   The boat depreciates by 20% in the third year, but this depreciation is applied to the value at the end of the second year.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation amount} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
   \]
   \[
   \text{Value after third year} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
   \]

Thus, the value of the boat after three years is \(\boxed{3528}\)."

- There are 54 red candies.
- There are twice as many orange candies as red candies, so the number of orange candies is \(2 \times 54 = 108\).
- There are half as many yellow candies as red candies, so the number of yellow candies is \(\frac{54}{2} = 27\).

Next, we calculate the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies:
\[
54 \text{ (red)} + 108 \text{ (orange)} + 27 \text{ (yellow)} = 189
\]

To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies:
\[
232 - 189 = 43
\]

Therefore, the number of pink candies is \(\boxed{43}\)."
"To determine the total cost Helen paid for her trip, we'll break down the expenses step by step.

First, we calculate the cost of one night at the hotel:
\[ \text{Cost of one night at the hotel} = \$80 \]

Next, we find the cost of one bus trip, which is 10% of the hotel cost:
\[ \text{Cost of one bus trip} = 10\% \times \$80 = 0.10 \times \$80 = \$8 \]

Since Helen stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, the total cost for the hotel is:
\[ \text{Total cost for the hotel} = 3 \times \$80 = \$240 \]

For the bus trips, Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost for the bus trips is:
\[ \text{Total cost for the bus trips} = 7 \times \$8 = \$56 \]

Adding the total costs for the hotel and the bus trips gives us the overall total cost:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$240 + \$56 = \$296 \]

Therefore, the final amount Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during her trip is:
\[ \boxed{296} \]"

First, we calculate the sum of the rainbow and oatmeal cookies:
\[ 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total number of cookies:
\[ 7995 - 5670 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the number of chocolate chip cookies made is 2325.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2325 \]"
"To solve the problem using systems of linear equations, let's define the variables first:

- Let \( T \) be the number of test tubes Igor gathered.
- Let \( B \) be the number of beakers Igor gathered.
- Let \( P \) be the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many:
   \[
   T = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

2. Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than requested:
   \[
   P = 14 + 2 = 16
   \]

3. Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and Igor gathered the correct number:
   \[
   B = 7
   \]

4. The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29:
   \[
   T + B + P = 29
   \]

Substituting the values of \( T \), \( B \), and \( P \) into the equation:
\[
8 + 7 + 16 = 29
\]

This confirms that the values are consistent with the total number of items placed on the lab bench. Since Igor gathered 7 beakers and placed a total of 29 items, the number of beakers he lost is:
\[
7 - (29 - 8 - 16) = 7 - (29 - 24) = 7 - 5 = 2
\]

However, the problem states that Igor lost a total of 6 items, and we have already accounted for 5 items (2 test tubes and 3 Petri dishes). Therefore, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
\[
7 - 6 = 1
\]

Thus, the number of beakers Igor lost is \(\boxed{1}\)."
"To determine how many screws James will have left over, we start by calculating the total number of screws needed for the tables. Each table has 4 legs, and each leg requires 2 screws. Therefore, the number of screws needed for one table is:

\[ 4 \text{ legs/table} \times 2 \text{ screws/leg} = 8 \text{ screws/table} \]

Since James is assembling 4 tables, the total number of screws needed for all the tables is:

\[ 4 \text{ tables} \times 8 \text{ screws/table} = 32 \text{ screws} \]

James has 40 screws. To find out how many screws he will have left over, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws he has:

\[ 40 \text{ screws} - 32 \text{ screws} = 8 \text{ screws} \]

Thus, the number of screws James will have left over is:

\[ \boxed{8} \]"
"To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, we start with the number of eggs in the first basket, which is 10. The second basket contains twice as many eggs as the first basket, so we calculate the number of eggs in the second basket as follows:

\[
2 \times 10 = 20
\]

Now, we add the number of eggs in both baskets to find the total:

\[
10 + 20 = 30
\]

Therefore, the total number of eggs in both baskets is 30."
"To find the total amount of money raised by the girls, we start by calculating the individual contributions:

1. Alexandra raised $430.
2. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = 430 + 320 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. Sarah raised $300.
4. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, so:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = 300 + 400 = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we sum up the amounts raised by each person to find the total amount raised:

\[
\text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
\]

Adding these amounts step by step:

\[
430 + 750 = 1180
\]
\[
1180 + 300 = 1480
\]
\[
1480 + 700 = 2180
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls is:

\[
\boxed{2180}
\]"
"To solve the problem, we start by setting up the relationships given in the question using ratios and proportions.

Given:
- Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
- Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron.
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Let's denote:
- \( V_a \) as the distance Aaron ran.
- \( V_v \) as the distance Vanessa ran.
- \( T_a \) as the time Aaron took.
- \( T_v \) as the time Vanessa took.

From the problem, we know:
\[ V_v = 4 \text{ miles} \]
\[ T_a = 16 \text{ minutes} \]

Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, the ratio of their speeds is 2:1. This means that for every mile Aaron runs, Vanessa runs 2 miles in the same time. Therefore, the time it takes for Vanessa to run 4 miles is twice the time it takes for Aaron to run 2 miles. Since Aaron ran 2 miles in 16 minutes, we can find the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles as follows:

\[ \text{Time for Vanessa to run 4 miles} = 2 \times T_a = 2 \times 16 = 32 \text{ minutes} \]

Thus, Vanessa took 32 minutes to complete her part of the race.

The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{32} \]"
"To determine the total amount of line the caretaker needs to buy, we start by calculating the required line for the existing 200 feet of dock. Given that 3 feet of line is needed for every foot of dock, the total line required is:

\[ 200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 = 600 \text{ feet of line} \]

Next, we subtract the 6 feet of new line that the caretaker already has from the total required line:

\[ 600 \text{ feet of line} - 6 \text{ feet of line} = 594 \text{ feet of line} \]

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy an additional 594 feet of line. The final numerical answer is:

\[ 594 \]"
"To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Reservations per night**: 6 reservations.
2. **Reservations per day**: Since the restaurant is open 2 days a week, we divide the reservations per night by 2, which gives us 3 reservations per day.
3. **Reservations per week**: Multiplying the reservations per day by the number of days the restaurant is open, we get \(3 \text{ reservations/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ reservations/week}\).
4. **Cost per reservation**: Each reservation includes 2 meals at $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. The total cost per reservation is \(2 \times 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}\).
5. **Total revenue per week**: Multiplying the number of reservations per week by the cost per reservation, we get \(21 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 315 \text{ dollars/week}\).

Therefore, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is **315 dollars**."
"To determine the selling price per watermelon, we start with the total cost price of $80 for 50 watermelons. The vendor made a profit of 25%, which means the selling price is 125% of the cost price.

First, calculate the total selling price:
\[ \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Cost Price} \times (1 + \text{Profit Percentage}) = 80 \times 1.25 = 100 \]

Next, to find the selling price per watermelon, divide the total selling price by the number of watermelons:
\[ \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \]

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.

The final numerical answer is:
\[ 2 \]"
"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. James is currently 18 years old, as he is twice as old as his sister Dora, who is 9 years old.
2. Since James is 18 years old and he is 19 years older than his father John, John is currently \(18 - 19 = -1\) years old, which is incorrect. Given that John was 19 when James was born, John is actually \(18 + 19 = 37\) years old.
3. John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so the youngest son is currently \(37 - 32 = 5\) years old.
4. In 3 years, the youngest son will be \(5 + 3 = 8\) years old.

Therefore, the final numerical answer is 8."
"To determine how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour, we start by calculating the rate at which each peels oranges.

Ana peels an orange in 3 minutes, so her rate is:
\[
\text{Rate of Ana} = \frac{1 \text{ orange}}{3 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ oranges per minute}
\]

Jane peels an orange in 4 minutes, so her rate is:
\[
\text{Rate of Jane} = \frac{1 \text{ orange}}{4 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ oranges per minute}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of oranges each can peel in 60 minutes (1 hour):
- Ana peels:
\[
\text{Oranges peeled by Ana} = 60 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ oranges per minute} = 20 \text{ oranges}
\]

- Jane peels:
\[
\text{Oranges peeled by Jane} = 60 \text{ minutes} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ oranges per minute} = 15 \text{ oranges}
\]

Finally, we find the difference in the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
\[
\text{Difference} = 20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
\]

Therefore, after an hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane. The final numerical answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"Mark's car radiator costs $400, but he gets it at 80% off. The discount amount is calculated as follows:
\[ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 \]
So, the cost of the radiator after the discount is:
\[ 400 - 320 = 80 \]

Next, the mechanic charges $50 per hour for 3 hours, which totals:
\[ 50 \times 3 = 150 \]

Adding the cost of the radiator to the mechanic's labor cost gives:
\[ 80 + 150 = 230 \]

Therefore, the total amount Mark paid is:
\[ \boxed{230} \]"
"To solve the problem, we start with the given information:
1. The total number of animals is 20.
2. The total number of legs is 70.

Let \( C \) represent the number of chickens and \( K \) represent the number of cows. We can set up the following system of equations based on the given information:

1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( 2C + 4K = 70 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing all terms by 2:
\[ C + 2K = 35 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( C + K = 20 \)
2. \( C + 2K = 35 \)

To eliminate \( C \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (C + 2K) - (C + K) = 35 - 20 \]
\[ C + 2K - C - K = 15 \]
\[ K = 15 \]

Now that we know \( K = 15 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( C \):
\[ C + 15 = 20 \]
\[ C = 20 - 15 \]
\[ C = 5 \]

Therefore, the number of chickens is \( 5 \).

The final numerical answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]"
"To find out how many slices each person can have when 7 pizzas, each cut into 8 slices, are shared equally among Henry and his 3 friends, we start by calculating the total number of pizza slices. 

\[ 7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices} \]

Next, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people sharing them, which is 4 (Henry and his 3 friends).

\[ 56 \text{ slices} \div 4 \text{ people} = 14 \text{ slices per person} \]

Therefore, each person can have 14 slices. The final numerical answer is:

\[ \boxed{14} \]"
